<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the BlackRock
USD Bond Factor Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of investment-grade and high yield, each as determined by BlackRock Index Services, LLC (the “Index Provider”), U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. Component
securities include U.S. Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“MBS”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and investment-grade and high yield U.S. and
non-U.S. corporate bonds. The Underlying Index includes bonds registered with the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of issuance or offered pursuant to Rule 144A with or without registration rights. As of July 31, 2021, the Underlying Index
includes approximately 8,000 component securities. The Fund may hold bonds of any maturity, although certain component securities are subject to individual maturity limits consistent with the Underlying Index methodology.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index seeks to enhance the performance and
balance return</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>sources of the aggregate U.S. dollar-denominated bond market while retaining
similar risk characteristics. This methodology selects component bonds from the broad universe of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and allocates them according to factor-based insights, unlike the methodologies used by traditional market value-weighted
bond indexes. Specifically, the Underlying Index determines constituents and their weights based on a proprietary factor model that systematically applies (1) macroeconomic factor timing, (2) macroeconomic factor tilt, and (3) style factors. These
factors attempt to shift exposures along major risk dimensions, including interest rate risk and credit risk, as described below.</div>
<div>The first step of the factor model is macroeconomic factor
timing, which considers high yield bond prices and the price momentum of high yield securities to determine the status of the economy (as reflected in the bond market) at a given point in time <font>(i.e</font>., whether
default risk is low, average and declining, average and increasing, or high). The status of the economy at rebalance is used to determine several features of the Underlying Index composition, including the Underlying Index’s duration and
duration-times-spread (“DxS,” which measures credit volatility) targets, as well as determining high yield and MBS sector allocations. The Underlying Index sets the CMBS and ABS weights in line with the weights in the iShares Core U.S.
Aggregate Bond ETF.</div> <div>The second step of the factor model
is macroeconomic factor tilt, which assigns the Underlying Index’s allocation to predetermined maturity bands of the yield curve, specifically (1) long-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds and</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>(2) short- and intermediate-maturity investment grade corporate bonds in
seeking to maximize total return per unit of risk (defined as duration for U.S. Treasuries and DxS for corporate bonds). The Underlying Index constituents are the result of an asset allocation optimization process that seeks maximum carry, the
return generated from an investment in a higher yielding security over a lower yielding security, assuming prices remain constant, subject to the Underlying Index’s duration and DxS targets.</div>
<div>The last step of the factor model is to select individual
securities based on style factor attributes: quality and value. The quality factor seeks to reduce relative exposure to securities with the highest default risk, and the value factor seeks to increase the relative weight of bonds with lower market
prices compared to other bonds with similar fundamental characteristics.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last business day of
each month. As of July 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury bonds. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower
costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and
liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in the
component securities of the Underlying Index and TBAs that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the component securities of the Underlying Index, and the Fund will invest at least 90% of
its assets in fixed income securities of the types included in the Underlying Index that BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund will invest no more than 10% of its assets in futures, options and swaps contracts that BFA
believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index as well as in fixed income securities other than the types included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent
investments</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>associated with a TBA position will be treated as part of that position for
purposes of calculating investments in the component securities of the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments
not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by the Index Provider, an
affiliated person of the Fund and of BFA, the Fund's investment adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized
by U.S. government securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem
its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of
other</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the
business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV
and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div> <div>Calculation
Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on
assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding
bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, or are substituted for other bonds, or because the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Because the Underlying Index is a new index and the Index Provider is also new to creation of securities indexes, there may be a greater risk that index errors will not be detected as quickly as they might be in the case of an index that has been
maintained over time by a long-standing index provider. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts.
Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to
purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify
interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to
such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would
cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets
and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund. The historically low interest rate environment heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund
is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Model Risk<font>.</font><font> Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index's allocation model will achieve its intended results or maximize returns or minimize risk, or be</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>appropriate for every investor seeking a particular risk profile.</div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small
number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Prepayment Risk.<font> During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with
lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the requirements
to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to
the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and
expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. <font>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (“ETFs”).</font></div>
<div>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font>The Fund invests in MBS issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, some of which may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. MBS
represent interests in “pools” of mortgages and are subject to interest rate, prepayment, and extension risk. MBS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds, and the prices of MBS may reflect adverse economic and
market conditions. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain MBS. MBS are also subject to the risk of default on the underlying mortgage loans, particularly during
periods of economic downturn. Default or bankruptcy of a counterparty to a to-be-announced (“TBA”) transaction would expose the Fund to possible losses.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. <font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics and may provide relatively lower returns than those
of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>other securities. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition
or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities
or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods
when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher
redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services
or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
