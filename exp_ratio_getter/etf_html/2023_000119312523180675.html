Description of the Trust and the Funds</font></div> <div><font>The Trust currently consists of more than 310 investment series or
portfolios. The Trust was organized as a Delaware </font><font>statutory trust on December 16, 1999 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end </font><font>management investment company registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. The offering of the Trust’s shares is
</font><font>registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>1933 Act</font><font>”</font><font>). This SAI relates to the following

by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(</font><font>“</font><font>BFA</font><font>”</font><font>), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and </font><font>generally seeks to track the investment results of the
specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that </font><font>Fund (each, an </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying Index</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>) only in aggregations of a specified number of </font><font>shares (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Unit</font><font>”</font><font>), in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (including any </font><font>portion of such securities
for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the </font><font>“</font><font>Deposit Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), together with the deposit of a
specified cash payment (the </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Component</font><font>”</font><font>). However, each Fund </font><font>generally expects to issue
Creation Units in exchange for cash. Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on Cboe BZX </font><font>Exchange, Inc.
(</font><font>“</font><font>Cboe BZX</font><font>”</font><font> or the </font><font>“</font><font>Listing Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>), a national securities exchange. Shares of the Funds are traded in the </font><font>secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable </font><font>only in
Creation Units, and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the </font><font>Redemption </font><font>of Creation Units</font><font> section of this SAI). As the planned termination date of each Fund approaches, and
particularly as bonds </font><font>begin to mature, each Fund expects to effect redemptions increasingly for cash. Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as </font><font>defined in the </font><font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role of the Authorized Participant </font><font>section of this SAI) typically are a </font><font>specified number of shares, generally 50,000 or multiples thereof.</font></div>
<div><font>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially
in cash </font><font>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in </font><font>advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized
</font><font>Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use </font><font>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the </font><font>Creation and Redemption of Creation
Units</font><font> section of this </font><font>SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that
include a cash portion may be higher </font><font>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with </font><font>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and
</font><font>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</font></div> <div><font>Exchange Listing and Trading</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of each Fund's Prospectus.

</font><font>markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the
</font><font>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The </font><font>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) a Fund is no </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</font><font>of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Fund.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a
</font><font>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</font></div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for
</font><font>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </font><font>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Investment Strategies and Risks</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in both fixed-income securities issued by
issuers that compose </font><font>the Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. </font><font>Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio
</font><font>will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to
have a </font><font>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </font><font>characteristics (based on market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating,
</font><font>maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses </font><font>representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</font></div> <div><font>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as
</font><font>described below.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of its Underlying Index, and each Fund will
invest </font><font>at least 90% of its assets in fixed income securities of the types included in its Underlying Index that BFA believes will help </font><font>each Fund track its Underlying Index, in each case except during the last months of each Fund's operations, as described
</font><font>below. Each Fund will invest no more than 10% of its assets in futures, options and swaps contracts that BFA believes will </font><font>help each Fund track its Underlying Index as well as in fixed income securities other than the types included in its Underlying </font><font>Index, but which BFA believes will help each Fund track its Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments
</font><font>associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating the percentage of </font><font>investments included in the Underlying Index. Each Fund seeks to track the investment results of its Underlying Index before
</font><font>fees and expenses of the Fund. Additionally, under normal circumstances, each Fund will invest at least 80% of the value of </font><font>its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from
</font><font>federal income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (</font><font>“</font><font>AMT</font><font>”</font><font>). This policy is a fundamental policy of
each Fund </font><font>and may not be changed without a vote of a majority of such Fund’s outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 </font><font>Act.</font></div> <div><font>In addition, the Funds may invest any cash assets
in one or more affiliated money market funds. In the last months of a </font><font>Fund's operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested in bonds, but
instead will be held </font><font>in cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation, shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, </font><font>AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes (tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, tax and revenue anticipation notes,
</font><font>grant anticipation notes and bond anticipation notes); variable rate demand notes and obligations; tender option bonds; and </font><font>municipal commercial paper, which will facilitate liquidation at the Funds' termination dates. These cash equivalents may not
</font><font>be included in the Underlying Index. </font></div> <div><font>On
or about December 1, 2023, the iShares iBonds Dec 2023 Term Muni Bond ETF will wind up and terminate. Upon its </font><font>termination, the Fund will distribute substantially all of its net

<div><font>Bonds.</font><font>
 </font><font>Each Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing </font><font>security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company or governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay
</font><font>interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity </font><font>date. Bonds generally are used by issuers to borrow money from investors.</font></div> <div><font>An issuer may have the right to redeem or
</font><font>“</font><font>call</font><font>”</font><font> a bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the </font><font>proceeds at lower market rates.</font><font> </font><font>Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds </font><font>mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a </font><font>“</font><font>coupon</font><font>”</font><font> rate that is fixed for the life of the
</font><font>bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. </font><font>Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its </font><font>value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is </font><font>purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its
</font><font>face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less </font><font>current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such
</font><font>fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of </font><font>bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on </font><font>“</font><font>floating rate</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>variable rate</font><font>”</font><font> bonds </font><font>may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final
maturities. </font><font>Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of </font><font>“</font><font>floating rate</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>variable rate</font><font>”</font><font> bonds fluctuates much less in </font><font>response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their
value may decline if their interest </font><font>rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a </font><font>shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally, prices of
</font><font>higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices </font><font>of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated
</font><font>obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets and, in the event of </font><font>liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general
</font><font>creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Borrowing.
</font><font> </font><font>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments
due from </font><font>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The
incurrence of </font><font>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </font><font>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </font><font>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </font><font>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as
</font><font>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </font><font>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
</div> <div>
<div><font>3</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_129aa051-2a00-466b-b9df-937605cdd49f_4"></a> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain types of
borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </font><font>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements
and other matters. It is not anticipated that </font><font>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </font><font>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may
</font><font>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </font><font>may be disadvantageous to do so.</font></div>
<div><font>Diversification Status. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund is classified as a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This means that each Fund may not
</font><font>purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </font><font>instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than </font><font>5% of the Fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more than 10% of the </font><font>outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, each Fund may invest more
</font><font>than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, each Fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified</font><font> without shareholder approval.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund intends to
maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a </font><font>regulated investment company (</font><font>“</font><font>RIC</font><font>”</font><font>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>Internal </font><font>Revenue Code</font><font>”</font><font>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are </font><font>distributed to
shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the </font><font>diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the
investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it </font><font>less likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective.</font></div>
<div><font>Lending Portfolio Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </font><font>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at
</font><font>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </font><font>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the Fund exceeds one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets
</font><font>(including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </font><font>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash
</font><font>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan. Substitute </font><font>payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</font></div> <div><font>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of
</font><font>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </font><font>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </font><font>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund
</font><font>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </font><font>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </font><font>are
subject to investment risk.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio
</font><font>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </font><font>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>BTC</font><font>”</font><font>) acts as securities </font><font>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance
</font><font>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </font><font>“</font><font>Board,</font><font>”</font><font> the trustees of which are the </font><font>“</font><font>Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>). JPMorgan </font><font>Chase Bank, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>JPMorgan</font><font>”</font><font>) serves as custodian for the Funds in
connection with certain securities lending activities.</font></div> <div><font>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </font><font>in the settlement and accounting process), </font><font>“</font><font>gap</font><font>”</font><font> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </font><font>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to
pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </font><font>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the
assets being loaned due to </font><font>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </font><font>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending
</font><font>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </font><font>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a
</font><font>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </font><font>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing
</font><font>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </font><font>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund
</font><font>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </font><font>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </font><font>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </font><font>be
changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </font><font>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could,
for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </font><font>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</font></div>
<div><font>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their
</font><font>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </font><font>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </font><font>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </font><font>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government
</font><font>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </font><font>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</font></div> <div><font>Liquidity Risk Management.</font><font>  </font><font>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Rule</font><font>”</font><font>) requires open-end funds, </font><font>including exchange-traded funds (</font><font>“</font><font>ETFs</font><font>”</font><font>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Program</font><font>”</font><font>) and enhance disclosures
regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </font><font>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the
Trust, has </font><font>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </font><font>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </font><font>“</font><font>highly liquid investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>moderately liquid
investment,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>
“</font><font>less liquid investment</font><font>”</font><font> or
</font><font>“</font><font>illiquid investment.</font><font>”</font><font> The Liquidity Rule defines </font><font>“</font><font>liquidity
risk</font><font>”</font><font> as </font><font>the risk that a Fund could
not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining </font><font>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio
investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </font><font>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the
</font><font>liquidity risk management program requirements for </font><font>“</font><font>in-kind</font><font>”</font><font> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule.
To the extent that an </font><font>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </font><font>liquidity risk.</font></div> <div><font>Ratings. </font><font> </font><font>An investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one
or more of </font><font>Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>Moody’s</font><font>”</font><font>), S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch
Ratings, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>Fitch</font><font>”</font><font>), or another credit rating agency </font><font>designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, or is
unrated but considered to be of </font><font>equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch </font><font>are considered </font><font>“</font><font>investment-grade</font><font>”</font><font> securities, bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate </font><font>credit risk and may possess certain speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate
</font><font>capacity to meet financial commitments.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Subsequent to purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an
investment-grade</font><font> rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s or below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are generally considered </font><font>below investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered predominantly speculative with
</font><font>respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, </font><font>carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. </font><font>Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>junk bonds</font><font>”</font><font> and are subject to a substantial
degree of credit risk. </font><font>Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch and </font><font>BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</font></div> <div><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(</font><font>“</font><font>CFTC</font><font>”</font><font>) subjects advisers to registered </font><font>investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser
either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, </font><font>more than a prescribed level of its liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>CFTC Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font>) or (ii) </font><font>markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered
</font><font>investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity </font><font>pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market
</font><font>itself as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool</font><font>”</font><font> or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>BFA has claimed
an exclusion from the definition of the term </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the Commodity Exchange </font><font>Act (</font><font>“</font><font>CEA</font><font>”</font><font>) pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or </font><font>regulation

<div><font>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to
</font><font>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Dodd-Frank Act</font><font>”</font><font>) in the U.S. and under </font><font>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other
</font><font>derivatives traded in the over-the-counter (</font><font>“</font><font>OTC</font><font>”</font><font>) market are subject to variation margin and
initial margin requirements. </font><font>Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, </font><font>reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund </font><font>of
trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the
Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </font><font>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of
</font><font>“</font><font>senior securities</font><font>”</font><font> under Section 18 of the </font><font>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits
open-end funds, </font><font>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </font><font>“</font><font>senior security,</font><font>”</font><font> other than borrowing from a
bank (subject to a requirement </font><font>to maintain 300% </font><font>“</font><font>asset coverage</font><font>”</font><font>). </font></div>
<div><font>Under Rule 18f-4, </font><font>“</font><font>Derivatives Transactions</font><font>”</font><font> include the following:
(1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </font><font>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the
foregoing, </font><font>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </font><font>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise;
</font><font>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse</font><font> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </font><font>under
Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</font><font> (</font><font>“</font><font>TBA</font><font>”</font><font>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </font><font>physically settle

<div><font>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below), the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4
</font><font>with respect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </font><font>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</font><font>“</font><font>DRMP</font><font>”</font><font>) and comply with a relative or absolute
limit on Fund </font><font>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</font><font>“</font><font>VaR</font><font>”</font><font>). The DRMP is administered by a </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives risk manager,</font><font>”</font><font> who is </font><font>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP
and </font><font>reports to the Board.</font></div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4
provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives
exposure</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(as
defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </font><font>adopts and implements written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </font><font>“</font><font>Limited </font><font>Derivatives User Exception</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>

investment companies that may invest in </font><font>CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not </font><font>have transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of
</font><font>lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that </font><font>invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay
</font><font>registration as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool
operator</font><font>”</font><font> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on </font><font>the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim
</font><font>with the CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or </font><font>regulation as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA in respect of the Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a </font><font>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually
agreed-upon time and price, </font><font>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </font><font>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase
</font><font>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </font><font>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </font><font>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div> <div><font>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </font><font>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is
</font><font>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </font><font>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within
</font><font>seven days.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund, should it decide to utilize them. Such risks are not unique to the Fund,
</font><font>but are inherent in repurchase agreements. Each Fund seeks to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal </font><font>uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with
</font><font>a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter </font><font>maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate </font><font>than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the
</font><font>counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>the position a Fund would
normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt </font><font>securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall.
As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would </font><font>be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</font></div>
<div><font>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </font><font>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing.
</font><font>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities </font><font>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the
</font><font>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </font><font>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </font><font>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required
</font><font>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </font><font>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the
</font><font>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </font><font>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</font></div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </font><font>financing
transactions (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds)
notwithstanding the </font><font>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </font><font>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or
</font><font>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </font><font>“</font><font>Regulation Regarding
Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font> above.)</font></div> <div><font>Securities of Investment Companies. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </font><font>money market funds) to the extent permitted
by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, </font><font>a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i)
3% of the total outstanding </font><font>voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company, </font><font>and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law </font><font>or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment companies, including, but
</font><font>not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits </font><font>discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for
</font><font>operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. </font><font>Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in
</font><font>connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund's </font><font>pro rata </font><font>share </font><font>of the fees and
expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies</font><font> </font><font>(as disclosed in the
Prospectus, as applicable).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</font><font>  </font><font> Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable </font><font>rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities,
short-term municipal money market funds and money market </font><font>instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally
short-term</font><font> investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA </font><font>or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, </font><font>fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions;

comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
bonds and </font><font>debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to </font><font>present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase
</font><font>agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the </font><font>opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these
</font><font>instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained </font><font>in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on </font><font>commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font></div> <div><font>Future Developments.</font><font> </font><font>  </font><font>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments
</font><font>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment </font><font>objective and do not violate any investment restrictions or policies.</font></div> <div><font>General Considerations and Risks</font></div> <div><font>A discussion of some
of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus. </font><font>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value
of the Fund’s portfolio securities may </font><font>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in
</font><font>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any </font><font>particular risk factor.</font></div> <div><font>Borrowing
Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a
Fund’s portfolio. </font><font>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </font><font>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div><font>Call Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by certain
Funds may </font><font>“</font><font>call</font><font>”</font><font> or repay the </font><font>security before its stated maturity, and a Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower
yields, which would </font><font>result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features. Issuers of </font><font>longer maturity securities may be more likely to call such securities as interest rates fall. As a result, the iShares iBonds Dec </font><font>2026 Term Muni Bond ETF's, iShares iBonds Dec 2027 Term Muni Bond ETF's and iShares iBonds Dec 2028 Term Muni Bond </font><font>ETF's
investment in certain callable securities maturing outside the term of the Fund may increase the likelihood that </font><font>securities held by the Fund are called prior to December 2 of the
relevant year.</font></div> <div><font>Illiquid Investments Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund
</font><font>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </font><font>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without
</font><font>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </font><font>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the
</font><font>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </font><font>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </font><font>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Issuer Insolvency
Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers
involves a high degree </font><font>of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer of </font><font>securities held by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide
</font><font>variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain. Insolvency of </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_129aa051-2a00-466b-b9df-937605cdd49f_9">
</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>municipal issuers exposes investors to increased uncertainty and risks as compared to corporate issuers because
</font><font>municipalities typically are not subject to formalized bankruptcy proceedings and there often is not a process whereby </font><font>creditor claims can be considered and addressed.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will
</font><font>receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to </font><font>whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed, and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to
</font><font>protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner </font><font>and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by each Fund will eventually be satisfied.
</font><font>Even if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, </font><font>there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by each Fund in connection with such plan of
</font><font>reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A </font><font>Fund may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral </font><font>challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the
</font><font>U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the </font><font>outcome of each Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the
</font><font>securities of the issuer held by each Fund could be re-characterized, or each Fund may receive different securities or other </font><font>assets, including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred
</font><font>stock (including convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock </font><font>purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. The value of equity securities received by
</font><font>each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or </font><font>conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. Equity securities received by a Fund through a bankruptcy </font><font>proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index,
</font><font>which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</font></div> <div><font>To the extent that each Fund receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial
</font><font>restructuring, each Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets </font><font>that each Fund could receive is an interest in one or more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a
</font><font>consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by </font><font>the 1940 Act.</font></div> <div><font>Securities or other assets received in a
reorganization or restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments </font><font>in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may
be subject to heavy selling or </font><font>downward pricing pressure after completion of the reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring </font><font>assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If each Fund participates in negotiations with respect to </font><font>a plan of reorganization or restructuring with respect to securities of the issuer held by each Fund, each Fund also may be
</font><font>restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If each Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund </font><font>may have more active participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</font></div> <div><font>LIBOR Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A
Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate
(</font><font>“</font><font>LIBOR</font><font>”</font><font>) to </font><font>determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. A Fund’s investments may
pay </font><font>interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A Fund may also obtain </font><font>financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a Fund may also reference LIBOR.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>LIBOR Replacement
Risk. </font><font> </font><font>The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (</font><font>“</font><font>FCA</font><font>”</font><font>), which regulates LIBOR announced </font><font>that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be published after June 30, 2023.
All other LIBOR settings and certain </font><font>other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average
(</font><font>“</font><font>EONIA</font><font>”</font><font>) ceased to be published after December 31, </font><font>2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>SOFR</font><font>”</font><font>) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight </font><font>collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase
agreement (</font><font>“</font><font>repo</font><font>”</font><font>) market and has been used increasingly on a </font><font>voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. On March 15, 2022, the
Adjustable Interest Rate Act was signed into </font><font>law in the U.S., providing a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate that is selected by the </font><font>Federal Reserve Board and based on SOFR for certain contracts that reference LIBOR without adequate fallback provisions. </font><font>On
December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate Act by </font><font>identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR
in different categories of financial contracts after June 30, </font><font>2023.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>9</font></div>
</div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_129aa051-2a00-466b-b9df-937605cdd49f_10">
</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>The regulations include provisions that (i) provide a safe harbor for selection or use of a replacement benchmark rate
</font><font>selected by the Federal Reserve Board; (ii) clarify who may choose the replacement benchmark rate selected by the Federal </font><font>Reserve Board; and (iii) ensure that contracts adopting a replacement benchmark rate selected by the Federal Reserve Board
</font><font>will not be interrupted or terminated following the replacement of LIBOR. These regulations apply only contracts governed by </font><font>U.S. law, among other limitations. Similar legislation and regulations have been and may be further adopted in other
</font><font>jurisdictions.</font></div> <div><font>Neither the effect of the
LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. Not all existing LIBOR-based </font><font>instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains
uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability </font><font>of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing instruments. Parties to contracts, securities or other
</font><font>instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the application of applicable transition regulations, potentially </font><font>resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund may have instruments linked to other
</font><font>interbank offered rates and currencies that may also cease to be published in the future.</font></div> <div><font>The effect of these changes on a Fund will vary based on, among other things, existing fallback or termination provisions in
</font><font>individual contracts and the potential renegotiation of existing contracts. In many cases, if an instrument falls back to an </font><font>alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative reference rate will not perform the same as LIBOR because the
</font><font>alternative reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive component in the rate calculation. In the event of a credit crisis, </font><font>floating rate instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those instruments using a
</font><font>rate indexed to the interbank lending market.</font></div> <div><font>Money Market Instruments Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </font><font>may be affected by changes in interest rates
or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </font><font>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for
the Fund to achieve its </font><font>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </font><font>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </font><font>market
funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </font><font>“</font><font>float</font><font>”</font><font> their NAV instead of </font><font>using a stable $1.00 per
share price.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal Insurance. </font><font> </font><font>A municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment
of </font><font>interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by either (i) the issuer at the time the bond is </font><font>issued (primary market insurance), or (ii) another party after the bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</font></div>
<div><font>Both primary and secondary market insurance guarantee timely and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all
</font><font>interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing </font><font>its credit quality and value.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Municipal security insurance does not insure against market fluctuations or fluctuations in each of the Fund's share price.
In </font><font>addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security before maturity </font><font>(redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying agent, or (iii)
</font><font>prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or any other
</font><font>provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the bond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may be a </font><font>provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may be retired before maturity.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Because a significant portion of
the municipal securities issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance </font><font>companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a
significant adverse effect on the value </font><font>of the securities insured by that insurance company and on the municipal markets as a whole.</font></div>
<div><font>Certain significant providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result
of </font><font>exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or </font><font>otherwise suffered extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into </font><font>question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the
</font><font>future. While an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a </font><font>municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by
</font><font>the insurer, the value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal </font><font>security independent of insurance.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Municipal Market Disruption Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal
</font><font>market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities </font><font>holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on
</font><font>municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before </font><font>state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, </font><font>the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Fund’s holdings would be affected, and the Trustees would
</font><font>reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain provisions of </font><font>the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. In many cases, there may be no
</font><font>bankruptcy proceedings available to handle claims in the face of a municipal issuer’s default or insolvency. Although the </font><font>issuers of the majority of the bonds targeted for investment by each Fund is expected to have a comparatively higher credit
</font><font>rating than municipal bond issuers that have defaulted on their obligations, there can be no assurance that those issuers will </font><font>not default. Further, the application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or
</font><font>among municipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market </font><font>generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular securities. Any of these effects </font><font>could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal Securities. </font><font> </font><font>The Funds invest in securities issued in the U.S. market by U.S. states and territories, municipalities and </font><font>other political
subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies or authorities
</font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>municipal securities</font><font>”</font><font>), the interest payments of which are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. The municipal securities </font><font>which the Funds may purchase include general obligation bonds and limited obligation bonds (or </font><font>“</font><font>Revenue Bonds</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law.</font></div> <div><font>General obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such
</font><font>issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Revenue Bonds are payable only from the revenues derived </font><font>from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue </font><font>source. Revenue Bonds that are issued to finance a particular project often depend on revenues from that project to make
</font><font>principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower </font><font>revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Additionally, the market values of Revenue Bonds may decline in times of
</font><font>higher inflation to the extent that revenues are fixed income streams. In other instances, the prices that certain Revenue Bond </font><font>issuers are able to charge users of their assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual
</font><font>arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the issuer’s revenues. Additionally, rising </font><font>interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for issuers of both general obligation bonds and Revenue Bonds, which
</font><font>could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div> <div><font>The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell
</font><font>municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is </font><font>generally characterized as a buy and hold investment strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the
</font><font>market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and lessens as the securities move further </font><font>away from such issuance date.</font></div> <div><font>Some longer-term
municipal securities give the investor the right to </font><font>“</font><font>put</font><font>”</font><font> or sell the security at par (face value) within a
</font><font>specified number of days following the investor’s request - usually one to seven days. This demand feature enhances a </font><font>security’s liquidity by shortening its effective maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a </font><font>demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term security, which could experience
</font><font>substantially more volatility.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal
securities are subject to credit and market risk. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more </font><font>with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower
quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate </font><font>more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</font></div>
<div><font>Prices and yields on municipal securities are dependent on a variety of factors, including general money-market conditions,
</font><font>the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the </font><font>maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are </font><font>subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not
</font><font>be as extensive as that which is made available by corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal </font><font>securities may be more difficult to value than securities of public corporations.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, </font><font>may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or
</font><font>state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints </font><font>upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the risk that their tax treatment could
</font><font>be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of </font><font>litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the </font><font>payment of interest and principal on their municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found
</font><font>to be invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing </font><font>uncertainties in the market for municipal securities or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the credit risk with </font><font>respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial
</font><font>portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in the same manner.</font></div> <div><font>Additionally, certain municipal securities are issued by entities dependent on revenue from a particular sector and thus are
</font><font>subject to the specific risks associated with that sector. These sectors are described in more detail below.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Health Care-Related Municipal Securities. </font><font>Changes to state or federal policy tied to health care services </font><font>could adversely affect the value of municipal securities
backed by revenue from public hospitals and other health care </font><font>facilities. Regulatory changes that govern cost reimbursements to health care providers under government-funded
programs </font><font>such as Medicare and Medicaid, including policies that award exclusive contracts to certain hospitals, may adversely affect </font><font>the revenue streams backing certain municipal securities. Additionally, the expansion of healthcare facilities by some issuers
</font><font>may be subject to </font><font>“</font><font>determinations of
need</font><font>”</font><font> by various regulators or other authorities. This process not only generally </font><font>increases the time and expenses such expansions entail, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, thus potentially limiting
</font><font>the revenue and growth of healthcare facility operators. Moreover, local, state and federal governmental bodies are under </font><font>increasing pressure to reduce medical spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory
</font><font>processes and public funding available for healthcare services and facilities. The value of healthcare-related municipal </font><font>securities could also be affected by a variety of other factors that impact the underlying healthcare facilities including
</font><font>demand for services, the ability of the health care facility to provide the services required, competition with other facilities, </font><font>and expenses (such as malpractice insurance premiums).</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.</font><font> Entities that issue municipal securities
related to infrastructure
</font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>infrastructure issuers</font><font>”</font><font>) may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their capacity to make principal </font><font>and interest payments, such as high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of
</font><font>leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, </font><font>increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on
</font><font>infrastructure projects, and other factors. Such issuers may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in </font><font>exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. Infrastructure
</font><font>issuers can be significantly affected by government spending policies.</font></div> <div><font>Leverage Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure issuers can be highly indebted, which increases investment risk and other
risks normally </font><font>associated with debt financing, which could adversely affect such an issuer’s operations and the market value of related </font><font>municipal securities in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div> <div><font>Operations Risk.</font><font> The failure of an infrastructure issuer to carry adequate insurance or to operate its
assets appropriately </font><font>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic </font><font>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div> <div><font>Regulatory Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure projects may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental
authorities and </font><font>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </font><font>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div><font>Strategic Asset
Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure issuers may control significant strategic assets (e.g., major pipelines or highways),
</font><font>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or </font><font>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry
</font><font>sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div> <div><font>User Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a narrow user base. If these users do not
patronize infrastructure </font><font>projects as expected, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable, in which case infrastructure issuers </font><font>may fail to pay their obligations.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Municipal Securities Issued By School Districts.</font><font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations </font><font>from, among others, the federal government and state governments.
As a result, municipal securities issued by school </font><font>districts may be adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or
</font><font>other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Investors in these securities, similar to investors in </font><font>municipal securities generally, face heightened risk of loss upon insolvency of the school district issuers because there is
</font><font>often no ready source of funding to pay the bonds other than the local tax base, which a bankruptcy court or administrator </font><font>does not control.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing
in Transportation Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.</font><font> The transportation infrastructure industry may
</font><font>be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and other operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, </font><font>in many jurisdictions, the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Municipal securities that are issued to </font><font>finance a particular transportation project (e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and </font><font>interest payments.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing
in Utility-Related Municipal Securities.</font><font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including
</font><font>state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. Various </font><font>future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing
</font><font>requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of </font><font>environmental and other governmental regulations. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. For example, gas utilities are </font><font>subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas
</font><font>utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for </font><font>the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas
</font><font>utility.</font></div> <div><font>The types of municipal
securities in which the Funds may invest include, but are not limited, to the following:</font></div>
<div><font>Industrial Development Bonds</font></div>
<div><font>Industrial development bonds generally are also Revenue Bonds and thus are not payable from the issuer’s general
revenues. </font><font>The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. </font><font>Payment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any
</font><font>guarantor).</font></div> <div><font>Private
Activity Bonds</font></div> <div><font>The Funds may invest in private activity bonds, which are bonds issued by or on behalf of
public authorities to obtain funds </font><font>to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities, sewage disposal, solid waste disposal or </font><font>hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other types of </font><font>private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for the construction, equipment, repair or improvement of privately
</font><font>operated industrial or commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the current U.S. federal tax laws </font><font>place substantial limitations on the size of such issues.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal Lease Obligations</font></div> <div><font>The
Funds may invest in municipal lease obligations, including certificates of participation (</font><font>“</font><font>COPs</font><font>”</font><font>) issued by government </font><font>authorities or entities
to finance the acquisition or construction of equipment, land and/or facilities. The COPs represent </font><font>participations in a lease, an installment purchase contract, or a conditional
sales contract relating to equipment, land or </font><font>facilities. As a result of their structure, COPs are generally not subject to constitutional debt limitations or other statutory
</font><font>requirements that may apply to other municipal securities. Municipal governments may not be obligated to make lease or </font><font>installment purchase payments in connection with COPs, and, in such circumstances, the COP will be secured only by the
</font><font>leased property. If the issuer of a COP does not fulfill its payment obligation, it may be difficult to sell the property and the </font><font>proceeds of a sale may not cover the Fund’s loss. Municipal lease obligations may be less liquid than conventional municipal </font><font>bonds, but otherwise have the same general risk characteristics as other municipal securities.</font></div> <div><font>Tender Option Bonds</font></div> <div><font>Tender option
bonds are synthetic floating rate or variable rate securities issued when long-term bonds are purchased in the </font><font>primary or secondary market and then deposited into a trust.
Custodial receipts are then issued to investors in these </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>13</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_129aa051-2a00-466b-b9df-937605cdd49f_14"></a> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div><font>securities
evidencing ownership interests in the trust. The remarketing agent for the trust sets a floating or variable rate on </font><font>typically a weekly basis. The sponsor of a highly leveraged
tender option bond trust generally will retain a liquidity provider to </font><font>purchase the short-term floating rate interests at their original purchase price upon the occurrence of
certain specified </font><font>events. However, the liquidity provider may not be required to purchase the floating rate interests upon the occurrence of </font><font>certain other events, for example, the downgrading of the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust below
</font><font>investment-grade or certain events that indicate the issuer of the bonds may be entering bankruptcy. The general effect of </font><font>these provisions is to pass to the holders of the floating rate interests the most severe credit risks associated with the
</font><font>municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust and to leave with the liquidity provider the interest rate risk (subject </font><font>to a cap) and certain other risks associated with the municipal bonds. Tender option bonds may be considered derivatives,
</font><font>and may expose the Funds to the same risks as investments in derivatives, as well as risks associated with leverage, especially </font><font>the risk of increased volatility. To the extent the Funds invest in tender option bonds, they also are exposed to credit risk
</font><font>associated with the liquidity provider retained by the sponsor of a tender bond option trust.</font></div> <div><font>Variable Rate Demand Obligations</font></div>
<div><font>Variable rate demand obligations (</font><font>“</font><font>VRDOs</font><font>”</font><font>) are tax-exempt obligations that contain a
floating or variable interest rate </font><font>adjustment formula and a right of demand on the part of the holder thereof to receive payment of the unpaid principal </font><font>balance plus accrued interest upon a short notice period not to exceed seven days. There is the possibility that because of
</font><font>default or insolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not be honored. The interest rates are adjustable at intervals </font><font>(ranging from daily to up to one year) to some prevailing market rate for similar investments, such adjustment formula being
</font><font>calculated to maintain the market rate of the VRDOs at approximately the par value of the VRDOs on the adjustment date. </font><font>The adjustments typically are based upon the Public Securities Association Index or some other appropriate interest rate
</font><font>adjustment index.</font></div> <div><font>Because of the interest
rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are not comparable to fixed-rate securities. During periods of </font><font>declining interest rates, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its
shareholders will forego the opportunity for capital </font><font>appreciation. During periods of rising interest rates, however, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will increase and its
shareholders will </font><font>have a reduced risk of capital depreciation.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal Notes</font></div> <div><font>Municipal notes
(also known as municipal commercial paper) are shorter-term municipal debt obligations. They may provide </font><font>interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants,
bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in the </font><font>anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may be delayed or the note may not be fully repaid, and the Funds
may </font><font>lose money.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal commercial
paper is generally unsecured and issued to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security </font><font>presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s
bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only out </font><font>of the assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors are repaid.</font></div>
<div><font>New or Unseasoned Municipal Issuers. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may invest in municipal securities issued by entities that have not previously </font><font>issued securities or that do not have an extensive history of issuing securities. Information regarding these issuers may be
</font><font>more limited than for other issuers. Securities of these issuers may be subject to volatility in their prices and may have a </font><font>limited trading market, which could adversely affect a Fund’s ability to dispose of them and could reduce the price a Fund </font><font>might be able to obtain for them.</font></div>
<div><font>Operational Risk.</font><font>
 </font><font>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as
</font><font>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </font><font>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management
</font><font>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </font><font>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of
</font><font>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </font><font>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </font><font>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
</font><font>occurrence or effects.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Repurchase Agreement Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a </font><font>security and
the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. </font><font>Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans
by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities </font><font>transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities
will </font><font>not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase </font><font>price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in
</font><font>exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the security </font><font>declines, a Fund may lose money.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Derivatives.
</font><font> </font><font>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived
from, the value of an </font><font>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </font><font>such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations and
</font><font>tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to </font><font>changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in
</font><font>derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk </font><font>that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of </font><font>leverage.</font></div> <div><font>When a derivative is used as a hedge against
a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </font><font>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice
versa. While hedging can </font><font>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </font><font>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to
</font><font>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging </font><font>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</font></div> <div><font>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal Securities. </font><font> </font><font>As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in </font><font>shares of each Fund will be taxed. The tax information in
the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as general </font><font>information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of each
</font><font>Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Unless your investment in shares is
made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an </font><font>individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Fund
makes distributions </font><font>or you sell Fund shares. In general, given its investment strategy, the Fund would not be an appropriate investment for a tax </font><font>deferred retirement account such as an IRA or a tax-exempt investor.</font></div> <div><font>In response to the national economic downturn in recent years, governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among </font><font>federal,
state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing </font><font>significant reductions in revenues and are consequently
experiencing difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these </font><font>state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may
experience </font><font>ratings downgrades of their debt.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the U.S. </font><font> </font><font>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations, inflation and/or an economic </font><font>recession in the U.S. may have
a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </font><font>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects
of financial, commercial, public </font><font>health, environmental, and other regulation and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the </font><font>value of certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels
</font><font>for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated </font><font>public debt service costs may constrain future economic growth.</font></div> <div><font>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries
</font><font>deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </font><font>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak
</font><font>of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which a </font><font>Fund invests.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>With respect to certain underlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the
applicable </font><font>index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed </font><font>investment concepts and strategies that could be considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted such
</font><font>indices using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole </font><font>user of the underlying index. In its sole discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other </font><font>instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and
</font><font>other instruments in the underlying index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may </font><font>also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s

responsibility for the Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>S&amp;P</font><font>”</font><font>) indexes, including </font><font>overall policy guidelines

separate regional index committees composed </font><font>of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>S&amp;P DJI</font><font>”</font><font>) staff specialized in the various

earlier.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Index Maintenance.</font><font> Maintaining the
S&amp;P Fixed Income Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for </font><font>bond additions and deletions, par amount changes, rating changes and corporate actions. Each
S&amp;P Fixed Income Index is a </font><font>market-value weighted index. Securities Evaluations/ICE Data Services, the pricing division of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>ICE</font><font>”</font><font>), reports the price of each bond in the index each day. The prices used in the index calculation will add the
accrued </font><font>interest for each bond to the price reported by S&amp;P. The total return is calculated by aggregating the interest return, reflecting </font><font>the return due to paid and accrued interest, and principal return, reflecting the capital gains or losses due to changes in S&amp;P's </font><font>end-of-day price and principal repayments and the reinvestment return, excluding the reinvestment of related cash flows. </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>Component Selection Criteria.</font><font>
Eligible bonds are approved by the S&amp;P Index Committee that oversees the management of </font><font>the Underlying Index and are added to the Underlying Index on the next Rebalancing
Reference Date, subject to the schedule </font><font>of the monthly rebalancing procedures. In order for a bond to be classified as eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, a </font><font>bond must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is a U.S. state, federal district (the District of Columbia) or </font><font>local government or agency such that interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes and the federal AMT as
</font><font>determined by the Index Provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be denominated in U.S. dollars; (iii) </font><font>the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody's, or BBB- by Fitch. A bond must be rated </font><font>by at least one of these three rating agencies in order to qualify for the index. A bond with an </font><font>“</font><font>expected</font><font>”</font><font> rating, as denoted </font><font>by data providers, of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch will qualify for the index as well. </font><font>For the avoidance of doubt, the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment grade; and (iv) each bond in
</font><font>the Underlying Index must have a minimum maturity par amount of $2 million to be eligible for inclusion. To remain in the </font><font>Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum maturity par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of each
</font><font>rebalancing date and must maintain a minimum maturity par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of four days prior </font><font>to last Business Day of each month (</font><font>“</font><font>Rebalancing
Reference Date</font><font>”</font><font>); (v) Securities Evaluations | ICE Data Services must </font><font>provide daily pricing on the bond; and (vi) new additions must have a dated date later than December 31, 2010 to be eligible
</font><font>for index inclusion. </font><font>“</font><font>Business
Day</font><font>”</font><font> is defined as any day that U.S. municipal bonds are traded, as determined by The </font><font>Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and/or the New York Stock Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>NYSE</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>S&amp;P

fundamental policies the following numbered investment policies, which cannot be changed </font><font>without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting
securities. A vote of a majority of the </font><font>outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in the Investment Company Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the </font><font>voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of
</font><font>the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund </font><font>has also adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental </font><font>investment
policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Therefore, each Fund may change its </font><font>investment objective and its Underlying Index without shareholder
approval.</font></div> <div><font>Fundamental Investment Policies</font></div>

<div><font>Each Fund has adopted a fundamental policy that, under normal circumstances, each Fund will invest at least 80% of the
</font><font>value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is </font><font>free from federal income tax, including AMT.</font></div> <div><font>Notations Regarding the Funds' Fundamental Investment Policies</font></div> <div><font>The following notations are not considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to
</font><font>change without shareholder approval.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>With respect to
the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does </font><font>not define what constitutes </font><font>“</font><font>concentration</font><font>”</font><font> in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </font><font>more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </font><font>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration
could change in the future. The policy </font><font>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </font><font>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </font><font>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly,
</font><font>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </font><font>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the
</font><font>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </font><font>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications,
</font><font>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </font><font>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give
</font><font>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment
Company Act </font><font>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </font><font>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total
</font><font>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </font><font>each Fund to maintain at all times an </font><font>“</font><font>asset
coverage</font><font>”</font><font> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </font><font>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than
</font><font>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </font><font>“</font><font>leveraging.</font><font>”</font><font> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </font><font>borrowings or
involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</font><font> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse
repurchase agreements and similar financing </font><font>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </font><font>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and comply with Rule
18f-4 </font><font>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </font><font>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and
</font><font>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</font></div>
<div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not
</font><font>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </font><font>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its
</font><font>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </font><font>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the
</font><font>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </font><font>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is
</font><font>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </font><font>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions
</font><font>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </font><font>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable
</font><font>law.</font></div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental
policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </font><font>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff
interpretations currently prohibit </font><font>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </font><font>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward
</font><font>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </font><font>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</font></div> <div><font>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except
to </font><font>the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, </font><font>under
normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment </font><font>purposes, in component securities in each Fund's Underlying
Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its </font><font>shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an
investment, the 80% </font><font>requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Funds into </font><font>compliance with this policy.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund has adopted a
non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </font><font>extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each
Fund will not purchase shares of any </font><font>registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </font><font>“</font><font>fund of funds</font><font>”</font><font> provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each Fund has knowledge that its shares are </font><font>purchased by another
investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</font></div> <div><font>Unless
otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply </font><font>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the
percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </font><font>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not
</font><font>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </font><font>without undue market or tax consequences.</font></div> <div><font>Continuous
Offering</font></div> <div><font>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable
securities laws. </font><font>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a
</font><font>“</font><font>distribution,</font><font>”</font><font> as such term </font><font>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on
their part may, </font><font>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </font><font>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</font></div>
<div><font>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after
placing </font><font>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </font><font>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand
</font><font>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </font><font>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </font><font>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as
</font><font>an underwriter.</font></div> <div><font>Broker-dealer firms
should also note that dealers who are not </font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> but are effecting transactions in shares,
</font><font>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </font><font>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </font><font>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are
</font><font>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </font><font>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the
</font><font>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </font><font>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</font></div> <div><font>Management</font></div> <div><font>Trustees and Officers.
</font><font> </font><font>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds,
including </font><font>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </font><font>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and

<div><font>Board – Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div><font>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a
</font><font>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </font><font>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </font><font>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </font><font>regular in
person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </font><font>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that
may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </font><font>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </font><font>providers to the Trust.</font></div> <div><font>The Board has appointed an
Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </font><font>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers,
officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </font><font>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The
</font><font>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </font><font>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </font><font>Committee to
assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </font><font>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups
to review and address the policies and practices of </font><font>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </font><font>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service
</font><font>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </font><font>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each
</font><font>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </font><font>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over
</font><font>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </font><font>enhance effective oversight.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on
</font><font>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </font><font>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk
</font><font>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </font><font>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </font><font>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s
</font><font>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </font><font>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </font><font>dedicated
Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</font><font>“</font><font>RQA</font><font>”</font><font>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </font><font>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their
</font><font>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </font><font>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent
</font><font>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </font><font>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's
</font><font>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </font><font>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief
</font><font>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </font><font>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public
</font><font>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </font><font>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </font><font>The
Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </font><font>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in
which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </font><font>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</font></div> </div>

The Nominating and Governance Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.</font></div>

largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </font><font>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may
be involved in the investment </font><font>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</font><font> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are
</font><font>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
</font><font>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </font><font>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or
</font><font>sold by a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock has proprietary
interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </font><font>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment
objectives similar to those of a Fund </font><font>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </font><font>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of
</font><font>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </font><font>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </font><font>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's
</font><font>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </font><font>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by
</font><font>the Funds.</font></div> <div><font>When BlackRock seeks to
purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </font><font>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good
faith discretion to be equitable. In </font><font>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </font><font>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </font><font>otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </font><font>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid
strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </font><font>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to
support </font><font>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </font><font>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </font><font>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or
</font><font>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </font><font>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to
</font><font>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </font><font>so.</font></div> <div><font>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio
decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </font><font>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the
price of the same security </font><font>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </font><font>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </font><font>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in
</font><font>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased
</font><font>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</font></div> <div><font>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or
</font><font>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>cross trades</font><font>”</font><font>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </font><font>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </font><font>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </font><font>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such
</font><font>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </font><font>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock and
its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </font><font>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices,
availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </font><font>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or
</font><font>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</font></div> <div><font>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </font><font>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises.
</font><font>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </font><font>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </font><font>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock
</font><font>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment
</font><font>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </font><font>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result,
</font><font>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </font><font>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached.
</font><font>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </font><font>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon
</font><font>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</font></div> <div><font>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary
</font><font>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </font><font>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make
</font><font>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </font><font>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have
</font><font>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </font><font>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict
</font><font>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the
</font><font>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </font><font>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </font><font>may
be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </font><font>and by its advisory clients.</font></div>
<div><font>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees
of other </font><font>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </font><font>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a
</font><font>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which
</font><font>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </font><font>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions.
</font><font>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may also create, write or
issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </font><font>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which
BlackRock has a significant minority </font><font>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </font><font>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially
</font><font>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income
</font><font>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </font><font>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the
</font><font>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </font><font>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative
</font><font>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </font><font>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative
</font><font>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </font><font>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity
</font><font>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div> <div><font>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by
</font><font>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </font><font>adverse to those of the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>At times, these
activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </font><font>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the
extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </font><font>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</font></div>
<div><font>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </font><font>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or
</font><font>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </font><font>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and
</font><font>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </font><font>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</font></div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other
</font><font>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </font><font>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation
</font><font>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </font><font>amounts.</font></div> <div><font>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,
adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </font><font>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund
will be required to </font><font>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </font><font>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it
</font><font>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</font></div>
<div><font>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of
securities </font><font>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </font><font>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program,
</font><font>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </font><font>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for
</font><font>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </font><font>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by
</font><font>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </font><font>pro rata </font><font>allocation. </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a
</font><font>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </font><font>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</font><font>“</font><font>shortfall risk</font><font>”</font><font>) in the securities lending
program. BlackRock establishes </font><font>program-wide borrower limits (</font><font>“</font><font>credit limits</font><font>”</font><font>) to actively manage
borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </font><font>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type
and </font><font>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </font><font>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of
</font><font>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </font><font>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans
</font><font>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation over time. In order to allocate </font><font>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending
capacity pursuant to the various program limits </font><font>(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a
</font><font>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </font><font>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to
</font><font>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </font><font>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for
</font><font>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </font><font>the firm.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may decline to make a securities
loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </font><font>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory
requirements and/or market rules, </font><font>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </font><font>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </font><font>loans overall.</font></div> <div><font>Purchases and sales of securities and
other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </font><font>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the
fact that they have different </font><font>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </font><font>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or
</font><font>required, or in cases involving client direction.</font></div> <div><font>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of
</font><font>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </font><font>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of
</font><font>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </font><font>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</font></div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or
</font><font>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </font><font>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to
</font><font>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </font><font>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy
</font><font>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </font><font>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock
</font><font>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </font><font>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other
</font><font>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </font><font>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions
</font><font>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </font><font>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that
</font><font>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </font><font>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock does
not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </font><font>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade
execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </font><font>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts
related to </font><font>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </font><font>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by
</font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </font><font>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services
</font><font>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </font><font>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also
</font><font>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </font><font>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides
</font><font>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same
</font><font>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</font><font>“</font><font>ECNs</font><font>”</font><font>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in
which BlackRock </font><font>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</font><font> </font><font>securities transactions for
</font><font>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </font><font>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like
</font><font>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </font><font>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the
</font><font>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client
</font><font>transactions.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock owns a minority
interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>MEMX</font><font>”</font><font>), a newly created U.S. stock </font><font>exchange.
Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </font><font>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such
Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </font><font>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting
</font><font>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </font><font>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and
</font><font>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </font><font>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in
</font><font>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </font><font>Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy</font><font>
section of this SAI.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>It
is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </font><font>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable
law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </font><font>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale
that tend to </font><font>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </font><font>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund
</font><font>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </font><font>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </font><font>listing requirements for the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>It is possible that
a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </font><font>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also
invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </font><font>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </font><font>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</font><font> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the
</font><font>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </font><font>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </font><font>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability
relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </font><font>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other
</font><font>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </font><font>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </font><font>also
benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </font><font>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to
BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </font><font>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds
or </font><font>products.</font></div> <div><font>Third parties, including
service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </font><font>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs
and conferences) for registered </font><font>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </font><font>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </font><font>provide services to a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may provide
valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </font><font>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from
the valuations for the same securities or </font><font>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </font><font>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information
</font><font>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </font><font>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such
</font><font>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</font></div> <div><font>As disclosed in more detail in the </font><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font><font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </font><font>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each
Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </font><font>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and
acts through </font><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </font><font>“</font><font>2a-5 Committee</font><font>”</font><font>), with assistance from other BFA
pricing committees and in accordance </font><font>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </font><font>“</font><font>Valuation Procedures</font><font>”</font><font>). When determining a
</font><font>“</font><font>fair value price,</font><font>”</font><font> the 2a-5 Committee </font><font>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in </font><font>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </font><font>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value
</font><font>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </font><font>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a
</font><font>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </font><font>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </font><font>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </font><font>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic
</font><font>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </font><font>receives an asset-based fee.</font></div> <div><font>To the extent permitted
by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </font><font>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In
connection with any such investments, </font><font>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</font><font> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts
</font><font>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </font><font>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different
</font><font>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </font><font>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with
</font><font>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </font><font>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available
</font><font>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </font><font>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock will
not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </font><font>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940
Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </font><font>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </font><font>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </font><font>in
which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </font><font>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to
purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </font><font>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock
and/or </font><font>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </font><font>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </font><font>BlackRock
may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </font><font>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies
for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </font><font>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services
for a </font><font>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </font><font>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, in connection
with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </font><font>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes
to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </font><font>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of
appropriate </font><font>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </font><font>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the
</font><font>issuer.</font></div> <div><font>The investment activities of
BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </font><font>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the
Funds invest in securities issued by </font><font>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </font><font>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </font><font>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds)
</font><font>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </font><font>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</font></div> <div><font>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of
</font><font>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </font><font>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As
</font><font>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </font><font>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </font><font>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
</font><font>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</font></div> <div><font>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited
</font><font>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </font><font>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </font><font>applicable
ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </font><font>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of
Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </font><font>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in
the </font><font>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </font><font>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be
</font><font>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </font><font>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</font></div> <div><font>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory
</font><font>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </font><font>to such security or asset.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may not serve as
an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may maintain securities
indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </font><font>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track
the performance of securities indices </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>46</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>also may use the
name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </font><font>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their
index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </font><font>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </font><font>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that
</font><font>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </font><font>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</font></div> <div><font>The custody arrangement described in </font><font>“</font><font>Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</font><font>”</font><font> may lead to potential </font><font>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses
</font><font>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </font><font>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </font><font>balances
uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </font><font>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that
BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </font><font>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions
</font><font>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </font><font>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or
</font><font>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, custodians, </font><font>administrators and
index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </font><font>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock
may also enter into contractual arrangements with </font><font>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated
</font><font>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </font><font>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to
</font><font>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock owns or has an ownership
interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </font><font>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service
provider in connection with the </font><font>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </font><font>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </font><font>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the
</font><font>profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may
create </font><font>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</font></div>
<div><font>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing
arrangements </font><font>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </font><font>a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </font><font>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</font></div> <div><font>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </font><font>Distribution Services</font></div>
<div><font>Investment Adviser.
</font><font> </font><font>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between </font><font>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </font><font>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory
</font><font>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </font><font>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and
</font><font>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted
</font><font>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </font><font>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may
</font><font>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </font><font>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</font></div> <div><font>BFA is
responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost </font><font>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit
and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </font><font>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and
disposition of </font><font>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </font><font>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</font></div>
<div><font>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund Operating
</font><font>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be
</font><font>eliminated by BFA at any time.</font></div> <div><font>For its
investment advisory services to each Fund, BFA received a management fee at the annual rates (as a percentage of </font><font>such Fund’s average net assets) set forth below.</font></div>

</table> </div> <div><font>Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview</font></div>
<div><font>The discussion below describes the Portfolio Managers' compensation as of October 31, 2022.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path
</font><font>emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of </font><font>components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation </font><font>include a
base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more </font><font>of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock,
Inc.</font></div> <div><font>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as
retirement and other </font><font>benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive </font><font>compensation, determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of </font><font>the
portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the </font><font>team relative to the portfolios’ investment
objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its </font><font>Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall
performance of these portfolios and </font><font>BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion </font><font>represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be
</font><font>granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term </font><font>shareholders and motivate performance.</font></div> <div><font>The
discretionary incentive income for James Mauro and Karen Uyehara includes as an additional consideration the </font><font>performance of actively-managed portfolios they manage over 1, 3 and 5
year periods measured against the respective </font><font>benchmark of each portfolio as well as peer group performance. A portion of the discretionary incentive compensation for </font><font>James Mauro and Karen Uyehara is distributed in the form of deferred cash awards that notionally track the returns of select
</font><font>BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which provides direct alignment of portfolio manager discretionary </font><font>incentive compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards vest ratably over a number of years and, once
</font><font>vested, settle in the form of cash.</font></div> <div><font>As of
October 31, 2022, the Portfolio Managers did not beneficially own shares of the Funds.</font></div> <div><font>Codes
of Ethics. </font><font> </font><font>The Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to
Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. </font><font>The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, </font><font>including securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at
</font><font>the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's </font><font>Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at
</font><font>publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div>
<div><font>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. </font><font> </font><font>The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the </font><font>“</font><font>Patriot Act</font><font>”</font><font>). The Patriot Act is </font><font>intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism
or other illicit activities. </font><font>Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to </font><font>form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information will be used to verify </font><font>the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for
</font><font>compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow a
</font><font>Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose identity </font><font>it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the Funds' policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any
</font><font>investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

State Street is required, upon the order of the Trust, to </font><font>deliver securities held by State Street and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. State Street

</font><font>lending by each Fund. JPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund securities lending activity in </font><font>coordination with other funds, maintains custodial records and provides other services. As compensation for these services,
</font><font>JPMorgan receives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC from its compensation for its services as securities lending agent.</font></div>
<div><font>Distributor.
</font><font> </font><font>The Distributor's principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are
continuously offered for </font><font>sale by the Funds through the Distributor or its agent only in Creation Units, as described in the applicable Prospectus and </font><font>below in the</font><font> </font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of </font><font>Creation Units</font><font> </font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units </font><font>are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the </font><font>applicable Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both
</font><font>orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer</font><font> registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>1934 Act</font><font>”</font><font>), and a member of the Financial </font><font>Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(</font><font>“</font><font>FINRA</font><font>”</font><font>). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S. states, as well as </font><font>in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin

<div><font>Securities Lending.
</font><font> </font><font>To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its
securities lending </font><font>pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of </font><font>BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Securities Lending Agency
Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its
</font><font>services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the </font><font>reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to
</font><font>and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities </font><font>lending, including custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each Fund is responsible for fees in connection with the investment of cash
</font><font>collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the </font><font>“</font><font>collateral investment fees</font><font>”</font><font>); however, </font><font>BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral
</font><font>investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales </font><font>load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</font></div>
<div><font>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The
determination </font><font>of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be </font><font>subject to a different fee arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</font></div> <div><font>Pursuant to the current Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>(i) fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment
</font><font>fees), and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>In addition, commencing the
business day following the date that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, </font><font>for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund
Complex (as defined in the </font><font>Management</font><font>—</font><font>Trustees and Officers</font><font> section of this SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a specified
threshold, each applicable </font><font>fixed-income fund, pursuant to the current Securities Lending Agency Agreement, will receive for the remainder of that </font><font>calendar year securities lending income as follows:</font></div>
<div><font>(i) 85% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less
than </font><font>70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in the most recent fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 primarily
included the </font><font>following:</font></div>
<div><font>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as
agent on </font><font>behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </font></div> <div><font>(2) negotiating the terms of securities loans, including the amount of fees; </font></div> <div><font>(3) directing the delivery of loaned securities; </font></div> <div><font>(4) monitoring the daily value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of
</font><font>excess collateral, as necessary; </font></div> <div><font>(5) investing cash collateral received in connection with any loaned securities; </font></div> <div><font>(6) monitoring distributions on loaned securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </font></div>
<div><font>(7) in the event of default by a borrower with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the
proceeds of the </font><font>liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that of the loaned </font><font>securities; and </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>(8) terminating securities loans and arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan
termination.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund had no income and fees/compensation related to securities lending activities during its
most recent fiscal year.</font></div> <div><font>Payments by BFA and its Affiliates.</font><font>  </font><font>BFA and/or its affiliates
(</font><font>“</font><font>BFA Entities</font><font>”</font><font>) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered </font><font>investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries (</font><font>“</font><font>Intermediaries</font><font>”</font><font>) for certain activities related to the Funds, </font><font>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make
these payments from their own assets and </font><font>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </font><font>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by
</font><font>investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </font><font>BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered
</font><font>representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including </font><font>the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations,
</font><font>educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems
(</font><font>“</font><font>Education </font><font>Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials
</font><font>relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (</font><font>“</font><font>Publishing Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). In addition, BFA Entities
make </font><font>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </font><font>their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature
</font><font>iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an </font><font>Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities
</font><font>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </font><font>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </font><font>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as
</font><font>revenue-sharing payments.</font></div> <div><font>Payments to an
Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </font><font>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your
salesperson or other investment professional. </font><font>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </font><font>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on
</font><font>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </font><font>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded</font><font> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </font><font>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </font><font>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</font></div> <div><font>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related
</font><font>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </font><font>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its
</font><font>customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and
</font><font>BlackRock mutual funds.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education
</font><font>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>FBS</font><font>”</font><font>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </font><font>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>NFS</font><font>”</font><font>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this
special, </font><font>long-term and significant arrangement (the </font><font>“</font><font>Marketing Program</font><font>”</font><font>), FBS, NFS and certain of
their affiliates (collectively </font><font>“</font><font>Fidelity</font><font>”</font><font>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and
</font><font>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </font><font>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge,
</font><font>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </font><font>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </font><font>programs.
Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </font><font>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the
Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </font><font>and NFS during the wind-down period.</font></div> <div><font>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties
</font><font>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology
</font><font>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made
</font><font>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </font><font>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the
</font><font>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </font><font>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital

Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other </font><font>third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</font></div> <div><font>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the
</font><font>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </font><font>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an
</font><font>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </font><font>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </font><font>combination of
the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </font><font>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in
general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </font><font>the next year. </font><font>Please contact
your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </font><font>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may
receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </font><font>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage
customers to </font><font>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</font></div>
<div><font>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an
affiliate </font><font>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </font><font>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then
</font><font>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </font><font>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee
</font><font>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </font><font>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</font></div> <div><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font></div>
<div><font>Valuation of Shares. </font><font>The NAV for each
Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE </font><font>(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held
by a Fund is as follows:</font></div> <div><font>Equity Investments. </font><font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </font><font>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous
transaction pricing information (each an </font><font>“</font><font>Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an
</font><font>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </font><font>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If
</font><font>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </font><font>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a
</font><font>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </font><font>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Fixed-Income
Investments. </font><font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued
</font><font>using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available bid prices </font><font>or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved
</font><font>independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use </font><font>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g</font><font>., recent
representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>relevant
information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable </font><font>quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from
dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and </font><font>assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional
round </font><font>lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than </font><font>institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days
</font><font>or less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including </font><font>asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash </font><font>flows
of each tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the </font><font>benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the
tranche.</font></div> <div><font>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </font><font>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </font><font>which market quotations are readily available are
valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </font><font>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price
available for an </font><font>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </font><font>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </font><font>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </font><font>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </font><font>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </font><font>may
incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </font><font>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as
of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </font><font>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with
</font><font>the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div><font>Underlying Funds. </font><font>Shares of
underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </font><font>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent
closing price.</font></div> <div><font>General Valuation Information. </font><font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </font><font>makers to value a Fund’s
securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </font><font>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation
is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </font><font>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </font><font>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div> <div><font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </font><font>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </font><font>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be
</font><font>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </font><font>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </font><font>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> <div><font>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</font></div> <div><font>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not
</font><font>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </font><font>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and
</font><font>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </font><font>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and
</font><font>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</font></div>
<div><font>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to
calculate </font><font>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </font><font>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</font></div> <div><font>Fair Value.</font><font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a
Fund’s investments are </font><font>valued at fair value (</font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Assets</font><font>”</font><font>). Fair Value Assets are valued
by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </font><font>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </font><font>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market
</font><font>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </font></div> </div> <div>
</div> <div>
<div><font>55</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_129aa051-2a00-466b-b9df-937605cdd49f_56"></a> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div><font>price source due
to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </font><font>unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the
security or other </font><font>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </font><font>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this
</font><font>purpose, a </font><font>“</font><font>significant event</font><font>”</font><font> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </font><font>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </font><font>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or
</font><font>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </font><font>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </font><font>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or
</font><font>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type
and significant </font><font>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </font><font>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and
</font><font>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </font><font>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect
</font><font>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </font><font>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an
</font><font>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </font><font>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined
</font><font>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</font></div> <div><font>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an
</font><font>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </font><font>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </font><font>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical
</font><font>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </font><font>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an
</font><font>investment.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </font><font>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </font><font>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </font><font>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
</font><font>accepted in the United States of America (</font><font>“</font><font>US GAAP</font><font>”</font><font>), follow the requirements for valuation
set forth in Financial </font><font>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>ASC 820</font><font>”</font><font>), which defines and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </font><font>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Generally, ASC 820 and other
accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </font><font>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing
the determination of the fair market </font><font>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </font><font>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </font><font>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</font></div>
<div><font>Brokerage Transactions</font></div> <div><font>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </font><font>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to
</font><font>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </font><font>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </font></div> </div> <div>
</div> <div>
<div><font>56</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>in positioning
blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </font><font>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the
lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </font><font>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </font><font>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In
</font><font>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA
</font><font>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services
provided.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>In selecting
brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </font><font>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors
including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </font><font>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the
transaction; (iii) </font><font>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </font><font>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of
</font><font>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </font><font>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </font><font>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of
</font><font>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </font><font>other circumstances.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Section
28(e)</font><font>”</font><font>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </font><font>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another
</font><font>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </font><font>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities
</font><font>under certain conditions.</font></div> <div><font>From time to
time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </font><font>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling
securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </font><font>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will
</font><font>provide research </font><font>“</font><font>credits</font><font>”</font><font> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </font><font>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</font></div> <div><font>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally
</font><font>traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </font><font>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or
</font><font>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </font><font>will generally include a </font><font>“</font><font>spread,</font><font>”</font><font> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </font><font>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</font></div> <div><font>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited
</font><font>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </font><font>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers
</font><font>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </font><font>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any
</font><font>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </font><font>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940
</font><font>Act.</font></div> <div><font>Purchases of money market
instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </font><font>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because
money market instruments are </font><font>generally traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis with dealers acting as principal for
their own accounts without a stated commission. The </font><font>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BFA may, from time to time, effect
trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </font><font>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and
regulations. Under these provisions, </font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred
</font><font>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </font><font>commissions or discounts are paid.</font></div> <div><font>Investment
decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </font><font>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety
of factors will be considered in making investment </font><font>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry,
</font><font>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </font><font>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi)
</font><font>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </font><font>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel.
</font><font>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </font><font>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </font><font>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or
</font><font>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </font><font>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client
</font><font>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </font><font>in which the Funds may invest.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Initial public offerings (</font><font>“</font><font>IPOs</font><font>”</font><font>) of securities may be over-subscribed and
subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </font><font>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </font><font>“</font><font>new</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>hot</font><font>”</font><font> issue, the supply of securities </font><font>available for
client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </font><font>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts
over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </font><font>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering
with respect </font><font>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </font><font>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market
</font><font>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </font><font>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally,
</font><font>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> basis. This
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if
pro-rating had not </font><font>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </font><font>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the
</font><font>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </font><font>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are
</font><font>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</font></div> <div><font>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities
</font><font>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </font><font>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same
</font><font>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </font><font>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold,
</font><font>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </font><font>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If
</font><font>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </font><font>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made,
</font><font>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</font></div> <div><font>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or
</font><font>“</font><font>bunch</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of
affiliates. In general, all </font><font>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </font><font>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a
</font><font>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </font><font>pro </font><font>rata</font><font> among the
clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </font><font>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all
accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </font><font>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases
this practice </font><font>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </font></div> </div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>could be
beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </font><font>during the same period may increase the demand for
securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </font><font>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader
has identified </font><font>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </font><font>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the
</font><font>order.</font></div> <div><font>There were no brokerage
commissions paid on behalf of each Fund for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, October 31, </font><font>2021 and October 31, 2020.</font></div>
<div><font>None of the Funds paid any brokerage commissions to BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, or to any other broker-dealer that is part
of </font><font>the BlackRock group of companies, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.</font></div> <div><font>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be combined with those of other investment companies, clients or
</font><font>accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other </font><font>accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are
</font><font>allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this </font><font>procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However,
</font><font>in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will </font><font>be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the
</font><font>Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers </font><font>or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by
</font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless </font><font>permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</font></div> <div><font>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater </font><font>brokerage expenses.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The tables below set forth the portfolio turnover rates of each Fund for the fiscal years

<div><font>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</font></div> <div><font>Shares.</font><font>  </font><font>The
Trust currently consists of more than 310 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues </font><font>shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The
Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each share issued by a fund has a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, </font><font>subscription or conversion rights and are freely
transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and </font><font>distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable
assets of such fund on </font><font>liquidation.</font></div> <div><font>Each
share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to </font><font>shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote,
provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote </font><font>together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more
than </font><font>one fund.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Under Delaware
law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the </font><font>1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of
shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 </font><font>Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under
</font><font>Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of
</font><font>trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a </font><font>“</font><font>control person</font><font>”</font><font> of the fund, as defined in Rule
0-1 under the 1940 </font><font>Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Shareholders may make inquiries by
writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, </font><font>Princeton, NJ 08540.</font></div>
<div><font>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares
of a </font><font>fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In </font><font>addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial </font><font>owners of 10% of the shares of a fund
(</font><font>“</font><font>Insiders</font><font>”</font><font>) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale </font><font>provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and
the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should </font><font>consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of
the 1934 Act and existing </font><font>guidance provided by the SEC staff.</font></div> <div><font>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the </font><font>“</font><font>Declaration of Trust</font><font>”</font><font>), the Board may, </font><font>without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,
</font><font>including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or </font></div>
<div><font>take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</font><font>  </font><font>The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the </font><font>Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on
</font><font>termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is </font><font>required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of
</font><font>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </font><font>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </font><font>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a
</font><font>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </font><font>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </font><font>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund will wind up and terminate on or about December 1 of the relevant year. Upon each Fund's termination, it will
</font><font>distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current </font><font>shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In accordance with the Declaration of Trust, each Fund will terminate on or
</font><font>about the date above as approved by a majority of the Board without requiring additional shareholder approval. The Board </font><font>may extend the termination date if a majority of the Board determines the extension to be in the best interest of the Fund.</font></div>
<div><font>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </font><font>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div> <div><font>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of securities between its participants (</font><font>“</font><font>DTC Participants</font><font>”</font><font>), and </font><font>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central
</font><font>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </font><font>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>DTCC</font><font>”</font><font>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </font><font>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them
</font><font>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </font><font>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC
</font><font>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</font><font>“</font><font>Indirect Participants</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
<div><font>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through
DTC </font><font>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </font><font>referred to herein as </font><font>“</font><font>Beneficial Owners</font><font>”</font><font>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </font><font>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
</font><font>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </font><font>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </font><font>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the
</font><font>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </font><font>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each
</font><font>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </font><font>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication,
</font><font>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
</font><font>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </font><font>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses
</font><font>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</font></div> <div><font>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </font><font>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </font><font>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its
</font><font>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </font><font>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </font><font>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </font><font>“</font><font>street name,</font><font>”</font><font> and will be the responsibility of
such DTC Participants.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or
</font><font>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </font><font>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC
</font><font>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </font><font>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any
</font><font>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </font><font>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable
</font><font>cost.</font></div> <div><font>Distribution of
Shares. </font><font> </font><font>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of
one or more </font><font>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized </font><font>Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such </font><font>initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration
</font><font>statement for each Fund (each, a
</font><font>“</font><font>Selling Shareholder</font><font>”</font><font>), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to </font><font>time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any
of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these </font><font>shares.</font></div> <div><font>Selling Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on
</font><font>any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in </font><font>the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the
</font><font>time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected through </font><font>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or
</font><font>through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size </font><font>by them through an Authorized Participant.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Any Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be
</font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of

 </font><font>The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally consists of the Deposit Securities and </font><font>the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the
</font><font>“</font><font>Fund Deposit,</font><font>”</font><font> which, when combined with a Fund's portfolio securities is designed to generate performance that has a </font><font>collective
investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and </font><font>subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such
Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments </font><font>as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund
</font><font>Deposit is made available.</font></div> <div><font>The </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Component</font><font>”</font><font> is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </font><font>“</font><font>Deposit Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> which is an amount equal to the
market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </font><font>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other
similar fees and </font><font>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </font><font>Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</font></div> <div><font>As the
planned termination date of each Fund approaches, and particularly as the bonds held by the Fund begin to mature, </font><font>the Fund expects to effect both creations and redemptions
increasingly for cash.</font></div> <div><font>The identity and number or par value of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to
changes in the composition of a Fund's </font><font>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to </font><font>the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments
</font><font>to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div><font>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities
</font><font>portion of the Fund Deposit through

instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </font><font>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below);
(iii) when </font><font>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </font><font>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an
</font><font>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </font><font>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</font></div> <div><font>Cash Purchase Method. </font><font> </font><font>When partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will </font><font>be effected in
essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the </font><font>Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit
Securities it would otherwise be required to provide </font><font>through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Procedures for
Creation of Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to
create a Creation Unit of </font><font>the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a </font><font>“</font><font>Participating Party,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font> i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process </font><font>through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </font><font>“</font><font>Clearing Process</font><font>”</font><font>), a clearing agency that is
registered </font><font>with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations </font><font>and redemptions of Creation Units (</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized
Participant Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>) (discussed below). A member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that
</font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an </font><font>“</font><font>Authorized Participant.</font><font>”</font><font> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede </font><font>&amp; Co. for the
account of a DTC Participant.</font></div> <div><font>Role of the Authorized Participant.</font><font>  </font><font>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that
</font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Such Authorized </font><font>Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor
</font><font>on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of </font><font>each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next
</font><font>determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An </font><font>Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such
</font><font>Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not </font><font>Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that
</font><font>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that </font><font>orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a
</font><font>result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust </font><font>does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list
</font><font>of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding </font><font>Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines </font><font>set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection </font><font>with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized
</font><font>Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div> <div><font>Placement of Creation Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. </font><font>government securities), through DTC
(for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such </font><font>as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a </font><font>“</font><font>Central Depository Account</font><font>”</font><font>). Any portion of a </font><font>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered
through a Central </font><font>Depository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely </font><font>fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Fund
</font><font>generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite
</font><font>number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of the Fund generally </font><font>before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account </font><font>must
be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository </font><font>Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the
Settlement Date. The </font><font>“</font><font>Settlement
Date</font><font>”</font><font> for all funds is generally the
</font><font>second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the </font><font>validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the </font><font>Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred
</font><font>directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State </font><font>Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are
</font><font>not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to </font><font>the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly </font><font>constituted
to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no </font><font>later than the second Business Day following the day on which the
purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, </font><font>provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the applicable Fund prior to such time.</font></div>
<div><font>Purchase Orders.</font><font>
 </font><font> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its
</font><font>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,</font><font> </font><font>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </font><font>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent
will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </font><font>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the
</font><font>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </font><font>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be
</font><font>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </font><font>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time
</font><font>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </font><font>such Business Day.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to
</font><font>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </font><font>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing
</font><font>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </font><font>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </font><font>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of
</font><font>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</font></div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash
</font><font>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</font></div> <div><font>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </font><font>of a Fund before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on
any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be </font><font>transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its
agent pursuant to </font><font>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </font><font>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each
</font><font>Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as the Fund's
</font><font>“</font><font>Cutoff Time.</font><font>”</font><font> The </font><font>Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an
</font><font>Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via
</font><font>communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. </font><font>Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined </font><font>after
such acceptance in accordance with each Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and </font><font>disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div><font>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </font><font>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to
</font><font>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </font><font>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </font><font>as set forth below.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div><font>64</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_129aa051-2a00-466b-b9df-937605cdd49f_65"></a> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Once a Fund has
accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </font><font>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The
Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </font><font>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent
provided that </font><font>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </font><font>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </font><font>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the
</font><font>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </font><font>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</font><font>e.g</font><font>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </font><font>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and
BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </font><font>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting
on behalf of such </font><font>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </font><font>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them
</font><font>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</font></div> <div><font>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</font><font>  </font><font> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </font><font>the applicable Fund of
the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</font><font> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund
Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </font><font>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </font><font>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are
</font><font>generally issued on a </font><font>“</font><font>T+2
basis</font><font>”</font><font>
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation
</font><font>Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the </font><font>circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</font></div> <div><font>To
the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units </font><font>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact
that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </font><font>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit
Securities as soon </font><font>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </font><font>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for
</font><font>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </font><font>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is
</font><font>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </font><font>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </font><font>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </font><font>and other charges.</font></div> <div><font>In certain cases, Authorized
Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </font><font>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require
a representation from the </font><font>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </font><font>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </font><font>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</font></div>
<div><font>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</font></div>
<div><font>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the
issuance </font><font>of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </font><font>Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized
</font><font>Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </font><font>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </font><font>price
movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </font><font>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of
transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </font><font>of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions
may be waived in </font><font>certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may </font><font>be charged a fee for such services.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> </div> <div><font>Redemption of Creation Units. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their </font><font>NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on a
</font><font>Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, </font><font>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors
</font><font>should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares</font><font> </font><font>to constitute a </font><font>Creation Unit
that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary </font><font>market.</font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be
</font><font>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</font><font>“</font><font>Fund </font><font>Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Redemption Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), and an amount of cash (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Cash Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> as described below) in order to effect </font><font>redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will
remain in effect until such time as the </font><font>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </font><font>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to
</font><font>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </font><font>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</font></div> <div><font>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist
</font><font>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the </font><font>shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund
</font><font>Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
</font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </font><font>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the
Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </font><font>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a
trading </font><font>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </font><font>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </font><font>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot
</font><font>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. For these </font><font>reasons, all or a substantial portion of the Fund Securities of each Fund may be substituted for cash. The amount of cash
</font><font>paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event that the </font><font>Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is
</font><font>required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund redeems Creation </font><font>Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each
</font><font>Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the </font><font>exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified to </font><font>minimize
the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through </font><font>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position
sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </font><font>“</font><font>rounded </font><font>up,</font><font>”</font><font> while limiting the maximum allowed
percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the </font><font>Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index
rebalance to </font><font>reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the </font><font>execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in

<div><font>As a percentage of the net asset value per Creation Unit, inclusive of the standard transaction
fee.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>Placement of Redemption
Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>Redemption requests for Creation Units of a Fund must be submitted to the
Distributor </font><font>or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable request to redeem </font><font>shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days
</font><font>when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed </font><font>earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption
</font><font>request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized </font><font>Participants upon request.</font></div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant
must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or </font><font>its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant
Agreement. Investors should be aware that </font><font>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </font><font>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an
</font><font>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </font><font>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified
</font><font>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </font><font>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to a Fund's transfer agent; such
</font><font>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </font><font>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>A redemption request is considered to be in
</font><font>“</font><font>proper form</font><font>”</font><font> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </font><font>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation
Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </font><font>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii)
a </font><font>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </font><font>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set
</font><font>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer
</font><font>agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities </font><font>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </font><font>the
relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC </font><font>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case
may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </font><font>Participant submitting the redemption request.</font></div>
<div><font>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain
</font><font>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </font><font>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</font></div>
<div><font>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund are generally made within two Business Days (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>T+2</font><font>”</font><font>). Each Fund </font><font>reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2, if necessary or appropriate under the
</font><font>circumstances and compliant with applicable law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, </font><font>including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link
</font><font>distribution to distribution record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption
</font><font>settlement process may be extended beyond T+2 because of the occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. </font><font>bond market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</font></div> <div><font>If neither the redeeming Beneficial Owner nor the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial </font><font>Owner
has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not </font><font>possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not
possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a </font><font>Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming Beneficial
Owner will be </font><font>required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net </font><font>asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in
</font><font>proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund’s brokerage and </font><font>other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be
</font><font>subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise </font><font>permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully
</font><font>deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such </font><font>laws.</font></div> <div><font>Prior to the final year of each Fund's
operations, the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units. </font><font>However, in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds
will be paid to the Authorized </font><font>Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter). If a </font><font>Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the
</font><font>extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of </font><font>the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than
</font><font>seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</font></div>
<div><font>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an
</font><font>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </font><font>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date
</font><font>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </font><font>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be
</font><font>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </font><font>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </font><font>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The
</font><font>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </font><font>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </font><font>Funds
at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </font><font>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the
Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </font><font>for related brokerage and other charges.</font></div>
<div><font>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period
</font><font>during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a
</font><font>result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably </font><font>practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</font></div> <div><font>Custom Baskets.</font><font>
 </font><font>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund will accept </font><font>“</font><font>custom baskets.</font><font>”</font><font> A custom basket </font><font>may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio
</font><font>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </font><font>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </font><font>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of
</font><font>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom
</font><font>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </font><font>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for
</font><font>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </font><font>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </font><font>be
used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </font><font>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by
an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </font><font>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and
procedures.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </font><font>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of
</font><font>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </font><font>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities
</font><font>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div><font>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will
</font><font>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </font><font>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </font><font>assets.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Taxes</font></div> <div><font>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and
</font><font>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </font><font>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current
</font><font>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and </font><font>non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative
</font><font>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Regulated
Investment Company Qualifications. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund intends to qualify for and to elect
treatment as a separate RIC </font><font>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at </font><font>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </font><font>and
meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s </font><font>annual gross income must be derived from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </font><font>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not
limited to, gains from </font><font>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </font><font>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded on an </font><font>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a
partnership that derives at least 90% of its </font><font>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </font><font>quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </font><font>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities
</font><font>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </font><font>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </font><font>value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or </font><font>more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related
</font><font>trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </font><font>partnerships.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Fund may be
able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </font><font>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax
and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </font><font>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as
an </font><font>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </font><font>income.</font></div> <div><font>Although in general the passive loss rules of
the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </font><font>with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A
Fund’s investments in </font><font>partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S.</font><font> income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation of RICs. </font><font> </font><font>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </font><font>income and capital
gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </font><font>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must
distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </font><font>“</font><font>investment company taxable
income</font><font>”</font><font>
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized
</font><font>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </font><font>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </font><font>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to
</font><font>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </font><font>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </font><font>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
</font><font>dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its </font><font>capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that
</font><font>doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. The Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such </font><font>income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and </font><font>profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than </font><font>two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the </font><font>excess of the aggregate
gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to </font><font>such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a
subsequent year.</font></div> <div><font>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </font><font> </font><font>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </font><font>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss
</font><font>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to
limitation.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The
following Funds had tax basis net capital loss carryforwards as set forth in the table below as of October 31, 2022, the </font><font>tax year-end for the Funds listed:</font></div>

<div><font>Excise Tax. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders in
each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </font><font>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For
this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </font><font>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by
</font><font>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </font><font>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends
</font><font>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </font><font>this 4% excise tax.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </font><font>Code as received by the
shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or capital gain </font><font>distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any
calendar year and payable to shareholders of </font><font>record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of </font><font>such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually
</font><font>paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment
</font><font>company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses </font><font>(including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net </font><font>long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject </font><font>to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as </font><font>undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income </font><font>tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit </font><font>their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax
</font><font>liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to </font><font>increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount
</font><font>in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital </font><font>gains will be entitled to a refund of their </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or </font><font>claims for refund with the IRS.</font></div>
<div><font>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as
long-term</font><font> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </font><font>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings
</font><font>and profits (</font><font>“</font><font>regular
dividends</font><font>”</font><font>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for
</font><font>taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds </font><font>certain threshold amounts.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an
</font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary
dividend,</font><font>”</font><font> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect
of </font><font>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </font><font>dividend. An </font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary dividend</font><font>”</font><font> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </font><font>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </font><font>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </font><font>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</font></div> <div><font>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </font><font>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </font><font>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution
</font><font>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </font><font>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be
</font><font>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </font><font>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </font><font>such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase </font><font>or
carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </font><font>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of
the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </font><font>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any
dividends </font><font>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </font><font>but as of the later of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the date on which a
</font><font>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired </font><font>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends

Shares.</font><font>  </font><font>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a
taxable gain or loss equal to the </font><font>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </font><font>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </font><font>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</font><font> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed
</font><font>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </font><font>distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </font><font>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be
</font><font>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </font><font>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
</font><font>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </font><font>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div><font>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or
</font><font>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </font><font>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </font><font>into account in computing gain/loss on the original
shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </font><font>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired
shares. Furthermore, the </font><font>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </font><font>provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a
</font><font>family of mutual funds.</font></div>
<div><font>Backup Withholding.
</font><font> </font><font>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the
U.S. Treasury such </font><font>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </font><font>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not
</font><font>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </font><font>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal
</font><font>income tax liability.</font></div>
<div><font>Sections 351 and 362.
</font><font> </font><font>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of
shares of the </font><font>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </font><font>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would
</font><font>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </font><font>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities,
</font><font>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>not anticipated
that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </font><font>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund
or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </font><font>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div><font>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.</font><font>  </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund that are properly reported as exempt-interest dividends will not be
</font><font>subject to regular federal income tax. Dividends paid on Fund shares that are loaned out pursuant to securities lending </font><font>arrangements will not be exempt from income tax. Each Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend
</font><font>distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, including the federal AMT. In the </font><font>last year of operation, when a Fund’s target date is reached, the Fund may invest in AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, </font><font>including tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, tax and revenue anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes and
</font><font>bond anticipation notes; municipal commercial paper; tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes and obligations. </font><font>The 3.8% Medicare contribution tax (discussed above) will not apply to exempt interest dividends paid by a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Dividends paid by a Fund reported as exempt-interest dividends will be exempt from federal income tax (though not
</font><font>necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the extent of the Fund’s net tax-exempt income as long as 50% or more </font><font>of the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal or other bonds that are excluded </font><font>from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as
exempt-interest</font><font> dividends. Exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund allocable to interest income from the municipal bonds of a </font><font>particular state may be exempt from income taxation for shareholders who are residents of such state. Exempt-interest
</font><font>dividends from interest from municipal bonds of other states generally are not so exempt. However, the receipt of exempt-interest</font><font> dividends may require a shareholder to recharacterize a portion of certain non-taxable social security and railroad
</font><font>retirement benefit payments as taxable income. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors. A Fund may engage in </font><font>derivative transactions with respect to obligations producing tax-exempt interest that may cause the Fund to not be treated
</font><font>as the owner of such obligations for purposes of the 50% threshold described above.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </font><font>options and futures contracts
(including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </font><font>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions
relating to </font><font>“</font><font>hedging
transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>straddles</font><font>”</font><font>) that, among other consequences, may
affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may </font><font>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.
</font><font>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </font><font>(a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed </font><font>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without
receiving cash with which to pay </font><font>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </font><font>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </font><font>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures
</font><font>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC.</font></div>
<div><font>A Fund’s investments in so-called </font><font>“</font><font>section 1256 contracts,</font><font>”</font><font> such as regulated
futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </font><font>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </font><font>section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any
</font><font>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </font><font>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a
</font><font>Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital </font><font>assets and were not part of a </font><font>“</font><font>hedging
transaction</font><font>”</font><font> nor part of a
</font><font>“</font><font>straddle,</font><font>”</font><font> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be </font><font>treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss
will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, </font><font>regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</font></div>
<div><font>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or
</font><font>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing
</font><font>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </font><font>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </font><font>more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a swap transaction will be netted </font><font>pro
rata</font><font> against both </font><font>tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be
required to currently recognize </font><font>income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps </font><font>to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss. Periodic net payments that would otherwise constitute </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>ordinary deductions but are allocable under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends will not be allowed as
</font><font>deductions but instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.</font></div> <div><font>Market Discount.
</font><font> </font><font>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market
discount bond is a </font><font>bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue </font><font>discount (</font><font>“</font><font>OID</font><font>”</font><font>). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s
</font><font>disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued </font><font>market discount.</font></div> <div><font>Non-U.S.
Investments.</font><font>  </font><font>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses
attributable to fluctuations in </font><font>exchange rates between the time the Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a </font><font>non-U.S. currency and the time the Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as
</font><font>ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 </font><font>gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the
</font><font>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain </font><font>non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to
</font><font>the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as </font><font>ordinary income or loss unless the Fund were to elect otherwise.</font></div> <div><font>Original Issue Discount. </font><font> </font><font>OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder </font><font>of the bond. Special U.S.
federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such </font><font>bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for
interest income. The amount of a positive </font><font>inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. </font><font>The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the
</font><font>general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s </font><font>taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need
</font><font>to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The amount of negative inflation adjustment, which </font><font>results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, </font><font>interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable </font><font>year.</font></div> <div><font>Reporting.</font><font>  </font><font>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for
an individual </font><font>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </font><font>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement,
</font><font>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </font><font>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </font><font>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font></div>
<div><font>Other Taxes.
</font><font> </font><font>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional
state, local and non-U.S. </font><font>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </font><font>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate
specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </font><font>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or
long-term capital gains are generally </font><font>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </font><font>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding
</font><font>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </font><font>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </font><font>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S.
</font><font>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional
</font><font>“</font><font>branch </font><font>profits tax</font><font>”</font><font> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN,
</font><font>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div><font>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a
</font><font>Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified net interest
income</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest
</font><font>and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, </font><font>reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified short-term capital </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>gains</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for
such taxable </font><font>year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as </font><font>such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as </font><font>ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.
</font><font>shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </font><font>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
</font><font>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </font><font>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
</font><font>rules to their accounts.</font></div> <div><font>Special rules
may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </font><font>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs
and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </font><font>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the
disposition of a </font><font>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </font><font>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of
</font><font>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </font><font>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding
</font><font>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</font></div> <div><font>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is
</font><font>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </font><font>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of
</font><font>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </font><font>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </font><font>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>The rules laid out in the previous paragraph, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund’s
</font><font>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</font></div> <div><font>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the
</font><font>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i)
</font><font>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </font><font>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </font><font>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will
</font><font>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, </font><font>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence
</font><font>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </font><font>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to
</font><font>account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their account </font><font>holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted,
</font><font>provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities will need to provide the </font><font>name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial
</font><font>U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</font></div> <div><font>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S.
</font><font>estate tax.</font></div> <div><font>The foregoing discussion is a
summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as </font><font>a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of shares should consult their own
tax advisors as to the tax consequences </font><font>of investing in such shares, including consequences under state, local and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing discussion </font><font>is based on applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, judicial authority and administrative
</font><font>interpretations in effect on the date of this SAI. Changes in applicable authority could materially affect the conclusions </font><font>discussed above, and such changes often occur.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Introduction to BlackRock</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of
</font><font>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </font><font>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </font><font>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </font><font>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the
</font><font>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</font></div> <div><font>Philosophy on investment stewardship</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders
</font><font>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </font><font>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they
</font><font>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </font><font>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws.
</font><font>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </font><font>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of
</font><font>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </font><font>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of
</font><font>“</font><font>one share, one </font><font>vote</font><font>”</font><font> helps achieve this balance.</font></div> <div><font>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our
</font><font>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </font><font>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast
</font><font>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </font><font>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </font><font>who have
given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</font><font>1</font><font> We also contribute to </font><font>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with
our clients’ interests as </font><font>long-term shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and
</font><font>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </font><font>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where
</font><font>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </font><font>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our
</font><font>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </font><font>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular
</font><font>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </font><font>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and
</font><font>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </font><font>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial
</font><font>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </font><font>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div><font>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with
</font><font>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </font><font>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our
</font><font>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier
and </font><font>more accessible for investors in separate accounts and certain pooled vehicles. As a result, </font><font>the
shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending </font><font>on whether our clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized
BIS to vote </font><font>in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in accordance with their </font><font>own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control </font><font>over their voting, nor
are we able to disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

</font><font>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</font></div> <div><font>Key Themes</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our
</font><font>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a company’s ability to </font><font>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </font><font>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the
</font><font>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </font><font>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div><font>These Principles cover seven key themes:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Compensation and benefits</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Other corporate
governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>Our regional and market-specific </font><font>voting guidelines</font><font>
explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </font><font>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</font></div>
<div><font>Boards and directors</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Our primary focus is on the
performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </font><font>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of
shareholders’ interests. As part of their </font><font>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </font><font>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and
</font><font>impactful responsibilities.</font></div> <div><font>We support
boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </font><font>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks
and opportunities,</font><font>2</font><font> as well as the </font><font>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </font><font>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </font><font>to
support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </font><font>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks
and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </font><font>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create
value is essential </font><font>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </font><font>mitigated.</font></div> <div><font>Where a company has not adequately
disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </font><font>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular
responsibility for the issue. We </font><font>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </font></div>
</div> <div> </div> <div> <div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>2</font></div>
<div><font>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of
risk and value </font><font>creation in a company’s business model that have an environmental or social dependency or </font><font>impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use, </font><font>waste management and
climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, </font><font>human capital management, impacts on the communities in which a company operates, customer </font><font>loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively </font><font>evaluate and
manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their </font><font>businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can oversee the creation of durable,
</font><font>long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related
</font><font>considerations is a component of a sound governance framework.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>our assessment of
their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In </font><font>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of
directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</font></div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Establishing an
appropriate corporate governance structure</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Supporting and overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </font><font>and
milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address anticipated or actual obstacles to success</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and
sustainability-related risks</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Overseeing the financial resilience of the company, the integrity of financial statements, and the robustness of a
</font><font>company’s Enterprise Risk Management</font><font>3</font><font> framework</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Making decisions on matters that require independent evaluation, which may include mergers, acquisitions and </font><font>dispositions,
activist situations or other similar cases</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Establishing appropriate executive compensation structures</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Monitoring business issues including material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,
that have the potential to </font><font>significantly impact the company’s long-term value</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div><font>There should be clear descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how they engage with and
</font><font>oversee management. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </font><font>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</font></div>
<div><font>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the company,
</font><font>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </font><font>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and
</font><font>regulations.</font></div> <div><font>Regular accountability</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</font><font> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </font><font>timely
manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </font><font>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all
directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </font><font>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</font></div>
<div><font>Effective board composition</font></div>
<div><font>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the
</font><font>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </font><font>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </font><font>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the
</font><font>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage
</font><font>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </font><font>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a
</font><font>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</font></div>
<div><font>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue
influence </font><font>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </font><font>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the
company</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Interlocking
directorships</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>3</font></div> <div><font>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, </font><font>and other
personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed to identify </font><font>potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk
appetite, to </font><font>provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives. (Committee of Sponsoring

<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Having any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially
</font><font>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and their shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div><font>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior
independent </font><font>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </font><font>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent
</font><font>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and
</font><font>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </font><font>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and
</font><font>contextualize a company’s approach.</font></div>
<div><font>When nominating new directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual
</font><font>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board composition. </font><font>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the
</font><font>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics </font><font>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board
</font><font>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and </font><font>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</font></div> <div><font>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of
</font><font>thought and avoiding </font><font>“</font><font>group
think</font><font>”</font><font> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows
</font><font>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </font><font>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </font><font>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</font></div> <div><font>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </font><font>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the
</font><font>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </font><font>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least
</font><font>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </font><font>take time.</font></div> <div><font>This position is based on our view that
diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </font><font>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies.
Academic research already </font><font>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</font><font>4</font><font> In </font><font>our experience,
greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </font><font>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also
promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </font><font>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect
</font><font>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</font></div> <div><font>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </font><font>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees
</font><font>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </font><font>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction,
</font><font>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</font></div> <div><font>Sufficient capacity</font></div>
<div><font>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate
</font><font>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </font><font>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </font><font>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font><font> </font></div> </div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock
recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </font><font>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made
by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </font><font>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</font></div>
<div><font>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under
</font><font>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </font><font>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate
</font><font>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </font><font>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a
</font><font>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </font><font>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance
</font><font>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</font></div> <div><font>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </font><font>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial
</font><font>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </font><font>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </font><font>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </font><font>Audit
committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </font><font>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of
the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </font><font>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor
in </font><font>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </font><font>oversee those functions.</font></div> <div><font>We take particular note of
unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </font><font>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit
committees should provide timely disclosure on </font><font>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</font></div>
<div><font>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on
</font><font>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </font><font>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </font><font>should
have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </font><font>process.</font></div>
<div><font>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management
</font><font>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </font><font>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </font><font>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to
</font><font>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately
</font><font>managing risk.</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment
and the priority of </font><font>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </font><font>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</font></div>
<div><font>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding
principle </font><font>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </font><font>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</font></div> <div><font>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </font><font>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and
</font><font>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </font><font>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time,
</font><font>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </font><font>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</font></div> <div><font>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal
</font><font>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while
</font><font>minimizing costs to shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>In
assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </font><font>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards
proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </font><font>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can
enhance long-term </font><font>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </font><font>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </font><font>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </font><font>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </font><font>a
best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </font><font>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a
separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</font></div> <div><font>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should
have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </font><font>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to
sell their </font><font>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </font><font>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We
</font><font>encourage any so-called </font><font>“</font><font>shareholder
rights plans</font><font>”</font><font> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </font><font>introduction and periodically thereafter.</font></div> <div><font>Compensation and benefits</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a
compensation </font><font>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </font><font>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </font><font>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies
</font><font>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </font><font>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </font><font>guard
against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </font><font>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred
compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </font><font>market practice.</font></div> <div><font>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has
</font><font>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </font><font>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer
</font><font>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the
</font><font>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </font><font>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </font><font>outperformance
against peer firms.</font></div> <div><font>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive
plans such that executives would be </font><font>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </font><font>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior
</font><font>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </font><font>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</font></div> <div><font>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in
</font><font>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </font><font>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with
</font><font>overseeing.</font></div> <div><font>We use third party
research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </font><font>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members for poor compensation practices </font><font>or structures.</font></div> <div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and
</font><font>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </font><font>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </font><font>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related
</font><font>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </font><font>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </font><font>disclosures are inadequate.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock encourages
companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </font><font>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business
model and to supplement that </font><font>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </font><font>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards
</font><font>(IFRS) Foundation.</font><font>5</font><font> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk disclosure, the four pillars of </font><font>the TCFD governance,
strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets are a useful way for companies to disclose how </font><font>they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related
risks and opportunities. SASB’s industry-specific </font><font>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators
(KPIs) </font><font>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </font><font>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality
</font><font>of these issues for many businesses.</font><font>6</font><font> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </font><font>be required by regulation, or one of a
number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </font><font>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</font></div>
<div><font>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various
</font><font>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </font><font>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </font><font>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and
</font><font>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</font></div> <div><font>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational
</font><font>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </font><font>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and
</font><font>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </font><font>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help
</font><font>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</font></div> <div><font>Climate risk</font></div> <div><font>It
is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </font><font>investors we are interested in understanding how
companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </font><font>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how
these factors are </font><font>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </font><font>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term
</font><font>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </font><font>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of
1.5°C.</font><font>7</font><font> It is, of course, up to each company to define </font><font>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</font></div> <div><font>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by
</font><font>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </font><font>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </font><font>can
benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>5</font></div>
<div><font>The </font><font>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation</font><font> announced in November </font><font>2021 the formation of an </font><font>International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)</font><font> to develop a </font><font>comprehensive global baseline of high-quality sustainability disclosure standards to meet
investors’ </font><font>information needs. SASB standards will over time be adapted to ISSB standards but are the
</font><font>reference reporting tool in the meantime.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div>
<div><font>6</font></div>
<div><font>While guidance is still under development for a unified disclosure framework related to
natural capital, the emerging </font><font>recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), may prove useful to some companies.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>7</font></div> <div><font>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated efforts; governments representing </font><font>over 90% of GDP have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of </font><font>clients
who have authorized us to do so, we look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not </font><font>anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public
policy.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>transition.</font><font>8</font><font> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </font><font>speeds.</font><font>9</font><font> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and
equitable transition – in </font><font>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </font><font>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they
</font><font>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </font><font>their business model and sector.</font></div> <div><font>We look to
companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </font><font>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions
(GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </font><font>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to </font><font>use and contribute to the development of low carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing
</font><font>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </font><font>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </font><font>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy
</font><font>sources is consistent with their strategy.</font></div> <div><font>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory
</font><font>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </font><font>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </font><font>basis
as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </font><font>risk.</font></div>
<div><font>Key stakeholder interests</font></div>
<div><font>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various
parties on </font><font>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </font><font>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </font><font>business
partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </font><font>operate.</font></div>
<div><font>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent
to </font><font>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </font><font>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business
</font><font>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </font><font>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse
</font><font>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </font><font>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</font></div> <div><font>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified
</font><font>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </font><font>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </font><font>strategy and purpose.</font></div> <div><font>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of
</font><font>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </font><font>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help
</font><font>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </font><font>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </font><font>changes to
governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </font><font>shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of
cumulative economic </font><font>gains over a 20-year period in an orderly transition as compared to the alternative. This better </font><font>macro environment will support better economic growth, financial stability, job growth, productivity, </font><font>as well as
ecosystem stability and health outcomes.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>

our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </font><font>purpose and business model.</font><font>10</font><font> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or
</font><font>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </font><font>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </font><font>how
the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </font><font>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a
fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </font><font>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant
shareholder proposals are </font><font>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div>
<div><font>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be
voted </font><font>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </font><font>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms,

<div><font>BlackRock is subject to certain requirements under antitrust law in the United States that place restrictions and
limitations on </font><font>how BlackRock can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit </font><font>shareholder proposals. As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by
</font><font>others.</font></div> <div><font>When assessing shareholder
proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </font><font>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the
issue raised, as well as its materiality and </font><font>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </font><font>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that
</font><font>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</font></div> <div><font>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and
</font><font>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to
</font><font>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </font><font>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support
</font><font>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </font><font>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded
</font><font>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </font><font>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </font><font>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how
</font><font>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </font><font>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</font></div>

</font><font>judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </font><font>shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </font><font>“</font><font>Conflicts management policies and
procedures</font><font>”</font><font>, below).</font></div> <div><font>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the
</font><font>relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </font><font>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory
</font><font>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </font><font>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term
</font><font>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</font></div> <div><font>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately
</font><font>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </font><font>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</font></div>
<div><font>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such
proxies, as well as </font><font>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </font><font>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv)
</font><font>“</font><font>share-blocking</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their
holdings for some </font><font>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </font><font>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting
</font><font>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </font><font>burdensome administrative requirements.</font></div> <div><font>As a
consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </font><font>“</font><font>best-efforts</font><font>”</font><font> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it
</font><font>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </font><font>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote
</font><font>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</font></div> <div><font>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic
</font><font>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </font><font>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes
</font><font>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because
</font><font>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform </font><font>manner.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity.
Such </font><font>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </font><font>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees. The following are </font><font>examples of sources of perceived or potential conflicts of interest:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock clients who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock business partners or third parties who may be issuers of securities or proponents of
shareholder resolutions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock

<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock, Inc. board members who serve as senior executives of public companies held in Funds
managed by </font><font>BlackRock</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>BlackRock has taken certain steps to mitigate perceived or potential conflicts including, but not limited to, the following:</font></div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to advance our clients’ interests in the
companies in which BlackRock </font><font>invests on their behalf</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Established a reporting structure that separates BIS from employees with sales, vendor
management, or business </font><font>partnership roles. In addition, BlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers, dissident </font><font>shareholders or shareholder proponents are managed consistently and without regard to BlackRock’s relationship with
</font><font>such parties. Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes </font><font>engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting </font><font>decision or
our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic </font><font>value of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may
engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </font><font>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </font><font>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </font><font>and/or to
otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting
</font><font>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance
</font><font>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </font><font>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </font><font>BlackRock uses
an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </font><font>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an
independent voting service provider to </font><font>make proxy voting recommendations for:</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>public companies
of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </font><font>the board of directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock
Funds</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>public companies
that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent
voting </font><font>service provider</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </font><font>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the
</font><font>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned
</font><font>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </font><font>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the
</font><font>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</font></div> <div><font>Securities lending</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A-14</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_725edbc0-4d65-4a6a-bb96-0ebcba067f8a_12"></a> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div><font>When so
authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </font><font>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also
enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </font><font>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</font></div>
<div><font>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by
our </font><font>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </font><font>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in
</font><font>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </font><font>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</font></div>
<div><font>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is
based on an </font><font>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </font><font>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall
</font><font>consideration).</font><font>12</font><font> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </font><font>the costs and
benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</font></div> <div><font>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining
whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </font><font>modify it as necessary.</font></div> <div><font>Voting guidelines</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The issue-specific Guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize
BlackRock’s </font><font>general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we </font><font>invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of </font><font>the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate
</font><font>how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide </font><font>insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</font></div> <div><font>Reporting and vote transparency</font></div> <div><font>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </font><font>engagement
and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </font><font>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our
investment stewardship engagement and voting </font><font>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</font><font>13</font><font> Additionally, we make public our market-specific</font><font> voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage. We also publish commentaries to </font><font>share our
perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</font></div> <div><font>At a more granular level, we publish quarterly
our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting during the </font><font>period, showing how we voted on each proposal and explaining any votes against management proposals or
on shareholder </font><font>proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a </font><font>vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all
</font><font>companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</font></div> <div><font>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </font><font>models
that support durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div>
</div> <div> <div>
<div><font>12</font></div>
<div><font>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the
United States, </font><font>for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting typically falls before the proxy statements </font><font>are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that </font><font>a vote has a material
impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record </font><font>date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh independent business judgement </font><font>as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an </font><font>estimated
record date without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have </font><font>a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending revenue for the
</font><font>fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby
</font><font>forgoing the opportunity to vote).</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div>
<div><font>13</font></div>
<div><font>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30 of the proceeding calendar year.</font></div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>These guidelines
should be read in conjunction with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship Global Principles.</font></div> <div><font>Introduction</font></div> <div><font>As
stewards of our clients’ investments, BlackRock believes it has a responsibility to engage with management teams and/or </font><font>board members on material business issues and, for
those clients who have given us authority, to vote proxies in the best </font><font>long-term economic interests of their assets.</font></div>
<div><font>The following issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the </font><font>“</font><font>Guidelines</font><font>”</font><font>) summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s
</font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>BIS</font><font>”</font><font>) philosophy and approach to engagement and voting, as well as our view of governance best practices and the roles
</font><font>and responsibilities of boards and directors for publicly listed U.S. companies. These Guidelines are not intended to limit the </font><font>analysis of individual issues at specific companies or provide a guide to how BIS will engage and/or vote in every instance.
</font><font>They are to be applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company, as well </font><font>as individual ballot items at shareholder meetings.</font></div> <div><font>Voting guidelines</font></div>
<div><font>These guidelines are divided into eight key themes, which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda
of </font><font>shareholder meetings:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other special transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Executive compensation</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>General corporate
governance matters</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder
protections</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div><font>Boards and directors</font></div>
<div><font>An effective and well-functioning board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of </font><font>shareholders’ interests, inducting the establishment of appropriate governance structures that facilitate oversight of
</font><font>management and the company’s strategic initiatives. As part of their responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to </font><font>shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction, operations, and risk management of the company. For this reason, BIS sees
</font><font>engagement with and the election of directors as one of our most critical responsibilities.</font></div> <div><font>Disclosure of material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and value creation, including, when relevant,
</font><font>material sustainability-related factors, is essential for shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively </font><font>the board is identifying, managing, and mitigating risks.</font></div> <div><font>Where a company has not adequately demonstrated, through actions and/or disclosures, how material issues are </font><font>appropriately
identified, managed, and overseen, we will consider voting against the re-election of those directors </font><font>responsible for the oversight of such issues, as indicated below.</font></div>
<div><font>Independence</font></div>
<div><font>It is our view that a majority of the directors on the board should be independent to ensure objectivity in the
decision-making </font><font>of the board and its ability to oversee management. In addition, all members of audit, compensation, and </font><font>nominating/governance committees should be independent. Our view of independence may vary from listing standards.</font></div> <div><font>Common impediments to independence may include:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Employment as a senior executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five years</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>An equity ownership in the company in excess of 20%</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Having any other interest, business, or relationship (professional or personal) which could, or could reasonably be
</font><font>perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and its </font><font>shareholders. We may vote against directors who we do not consider to be independent, including at controlled </font><font>companies,
when we believe oversight could be enhanced with greater independent director representation. To signal </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A-18</font></div>
</div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a name="xx_1de62697-4aec-4dc0-bb56-2691d9ed6995_3">
</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>our concerns, we may also vote against the chair of the nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, </font><font>the
nominating/governance committee member with the longest tenure.</font></div> <div><font>Oversight
role of the board</font></div> <div><font>The board should exercise appropriate oversight of management and the business activities
of the company. Where we </font><font>determine that a board has failed to do so in a way that may impede a company’s long-term value, we may vote against the </font><font>responsible committees and/or individual directors.</font></div>
<div><font>Common circumstances are illustrated below:</font></div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing or accounting practices,
we may vote against </font><font>members of the audit committee</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Where the company has failed to provide shareholders with adequate disclosure to conclude that
appropriate strategic </font><font>consideration is given to material risk factors (including, where relevant, sustainability factors), we may vote against </font><font>members of the responsible committee, or the most relevant director</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Where it appears that a director has acted (at the company or at other companies) in a manner
that compromises their </font><font>ability to represent the best long-term economic interests of shareholders, we may vote against that individual</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Where a director
has a multi-year pattern of poor attendance at combined board and applicable committee meetings, or </font><font>a director has poor attendance in a single year with no disclosed rationale, we
may vote against that individual. </font><font>Excluding exigent circumstances, BIS generally considers attendance at less than 75% of the combined board and </font><font>applicable committee meetings to be poor attendance</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Where a director serves on an excessive number of boards, which may limit their capacity to
focus on each board’s </font><font>needs, we may vote against that individual. The following identifies the maximum number of boards on which a director </font><font>may serve, before BIS considers them to be over-committed:</font><font> </font></div> </div>

recognize that board leadership roles may vary in responsibility and time requirements in different markets </font><font>around the world. In particular, where a director maintains a Chair role
of a publicly listed company in European markets, we </font><font>may consider that responsibility as equal to two board commitments, consistent with our EMEA Proxy Voting Guidelines. We
</font><font>will take the total number of board commitments across our global policies into account for director elections.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk oversight</font></div>
<div><font>Companies should have an established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing business and material risks.
</font><font>Independent directors should have access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure </font><font>they can properly oversee risk. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk management, mitigation, and
</font><font>reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to </font><font>changes in corporate strategy and/or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosures provide
</font><font>investors with a sense of the company’s long-term risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s </font><font>oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing
</font><font>risk.</font></div>
<div><font>Board Structure</font></div>
<div><font>Classified board of directors/staggered terms</font></div>
<div><font>Directors should be re-elected annually; classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to
regularly evaluate a </font><font>board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we </font><font>may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure. This may
</font><font>include when a company needs consistency and stability during a time of transition, e.g., newly public companies or </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

Lead Independent director, with the ability to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of </font><font>the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of
independent directors. These roles and responsibilities should be </font><font>disclosed and easily accessible.</font></div> <div><font>The following table illustrates examples</font><font>18</font><font> of responsibilities under each board leadership model:</font><font> </font></div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>CEO and management succession planning</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Companies should have a robust CEO and senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed
</font><font>and updated on a regular basis. Succession planning should cover scenarios over both the long-term, consistent with the </font><font>strategic direction of the company and identified leadership needs over time, as well as the short-term, in the event of an
</font><font>unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain their executive succession planning process, </font><font>including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information
</font><font>commonly associated with this exercise.</font></div>
<div><font>During a CEO transition, companies may elect for the departing CEO to maintain a role in the boardroom. We ask for
</font><font>disclosures to understand the timeframe and responsibilities of this role. In such instances, we typically look for the board to </font><font>have appropriate independent leadership structures in place. (See chart above.)</font></div> <div><font>Director</font><font> </font><font> compensation</font><font> </font><font>and</font><font> </font><font>equity</font><font> programs</font></div>
<div><font>Compensation for directors should generally be structured to attract and retain directors, while also aligning their
interests </font><font>with those of shareholders. In our view, director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value </font><font>creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal.</font></div> <div><font>Board composition and effectiveness</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Director</font><font> </font><font> qualifications</font><font> </font><font>and</font><font> </font><font>skills</font></div>
<div><font>We encourage boards to periodically review director qualifications and skills to ensure relevant experience and diverse
</font><font>perspectives are represented in the boardroom. To this end, performance reviews and skills assessments should be
</font><font>conducted by the nominating/governance committee or the Lead Independent Director. This process may include internal </font><font>board evaluations; however, boards may also find it useful to periodically conduct an assessment with a third party. We
</font><font>encourage boards to disclose their approach to evaluations, including objectives of the evaluation; if an external party </font><font>conducts the evaluation; the frequency of the evaluations; and, whether that evaluation occurs on an individual director
</font><font>basis.</font></div>
<div><font>Board</font><font> </font><font> term</font><font> </font><font>limits and</font><font> </font><font>director</font><font> tenure</font></div> <div><font>Where
boards find that age limits or term limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board </font><font>refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s
determination in setting such limits. BIS will also consider the average board </font><font>tenure to evaluate processes for board renewal. We may oppose boards that appear to have an
insufficient mix of short-, </font><font>medium-, and long-tenured directors.</font></div> <div><font>Board</font><font> </font><font> diversity</font></div> <div><font>As
noted above, highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business </font><font>enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the
voice of shareholders in board discussions. In our view, a strong </font><font>board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and contributing to the most
important </font><font>management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</font></div> <div><font>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the boardroom. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of
</font><font>thought and avoiding ‘group think’ in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </font><font>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered
</font><font>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </font><font>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ ethnicity, and age.</font></div>
<div><font>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization,
business model, and </font><font>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </font><font>company’s customers, employees, and communities. Self- identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </font><font>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least
</font><font>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </font><font>take time.</font></div> <div><font>This position is based on our view that
diversity of perspective and thought—in the boardroom, in the management team </font><font>and throughout the company—leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies.

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>reveals
correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</font><font>19</font><font> In </font><font>our experience, greater diversity in the boardroom contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and
resilient </font><font>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the boardroom can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </font><font>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect
</font><font>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</font></div> <div><font>In the U.S., we believe that boards should aspire to at least 30% diversity of
membership,</font><font>20</font><font> and we encourage large </font><font>companies, such as those in the S&amp;P 500, to lead in achieving this standard. In our view, an informative indicator of diversity </font><font>for such companies is having at least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group.</font><font>21</font><font> </font><font>We
recognize that it may take time and that companies with smaller market capitalizations and in certain sectors may face </font><font>more challenges in pursuing diversity. Among these smaller
companies, we look for the presence of diversity and take into </font><font>consideration the progress that companies are making.</font></div>
<div><font>In order to help investors understand overall diversity, we look to boards to disclose:</font></div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>How diversity, including demographic factors and professional characteristics, is considered in
board composition, given </font><font>the company’s long-term strategy and business model</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>How directors’ professional characteristics, which may include domain expertise such as
finance or technology, and </font><font>sector- or market-specific experience, are complementary and link to the company’s long-term strategy</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The process by
which candidates for board positions are identified, including whether professional firms or other </font><font>resources outside of incumbent directors’ networks are engaged to identify
and/or assess candidates, and whether a </font><font>diverse slate of nominees is considered for all available board nominations</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div><font>To the extent that, based on our assessment of corporate disclosures, a company has not adequately explained
their </font><font>approach to diversity in their board composition, we may vote against members of the nominating/governance committee. </font><font>Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to board diversity.</font></div> <div><font>Board</font><font> </font><font> size</font></div> <div><font>We
typically defer to the board in setting the appropriate size and believe that directors are generally in the best position to </font><font>assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness.
However, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or </font><font>individual directors if, in our view, the board is ineffective in its oversight, either because it is too small to
allow for the </font><font>necessary range of skills and experience or too large to function efficiently.</font></div> <div><font>Board responsiveness and shareholder rights</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder rights</font></div> <div><font>Where we
determine that a board has not acted in the best interests of the company’s shareholders, or takes action to </font><font>unreasonably limit shareholder rights, we may vote against the
appropriate committees and/or individual directors. Common </font><font>circumstances are illustrated below:</font></div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance
committee, where a </font><font>board implements or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance
committee, where a </font><font>board amends the charter/articles/bylaws and where the effect may be to entrench directors or to unreasonably reduce </font><font>shareholder rights</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Members of the compensation committee where the company has repriced options without shareholder approval If a </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>

<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>20</font></div> <div><font>We take a case-by-case approach and consider the size of the board in our evaluation of overall composition and diversity.
</font><font>Business model, strategy, location, and company size may also impact our analysis of board diversity. We acknowledge </font><font>that these factors may also play into the various elements of diversity that a board may attract. We look for disclosures
</font><font>from companies to help us understand their approach and do not prescribe any particular board composition.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>board maintains a classified structure, it is possible that the director(s) or committee members with whom we have a
</font><font>particular concern may not be subject to election in the year that the concern arises. In such situations, we may register </font><font>our concern by voting against the most relevant director(s) up for election.</font></div> <div><font>Responsiveness to shareholders</font></div> <div><font>A board should be engaged and responsive to the company’s shareholders, including acknowledging voting outcomes for
</font><font>director elections, compensation, shareholder proposals, and other ballot items. Where we determine that a board has not </font><font>substantially addressed shareholder concerns that we deem material to the business, we may vote against the responsible
</font><font>committees and/or individual directors. Common circumstances are illustrated below:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director, members of the nominating/governance committee, and/or the </font><font>longest
tenured director(s), where we observe a lack of board responsiveness to shareholders, evidence of board </font><font>entrenchment, and/or failure to plan for adequate board member
succession</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The chair of the
nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating/governance committee </font><font>member with the longest tenure, where board member(s) at the most recent election of
directors have received against </font><font>votes from more than 25% of shares voted, and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder </font><font>concerns. This may not apply in cases where BIS did not support the initial vote against such board member(s)</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and/or members of the nominating/governance
committee, </font><font>where a board fails to consider shareholder proposals that (1) receive substantial support, and (2) in our view, have a </font><font>material impact on the business, shareholder rights, or the potential for long-term value creation</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div><font>Majority vote requirements</font></div>
<div><font>Directors should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted. We will normally support proposals seeking to
</font><font>introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority vote standards generally assist in ensuring </font><font>that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. As a best
</font><font>practice, companies with either a majority vote standard or a plurality vote standard should adopt a resignation policy for </font><font>directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where the company already has a sufficiently
</font><font>robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</font></div>
<div><font>We note that majority voting may not be appropriate in all circumstances, for example, in the context of a contested
election, </font><font>or for majority-controlled companies or those with concentrated ownership structures.</font></div> <div><font>Cumulative voting</font></div>
<div><font>As stated above, a majority vote standard is generally in the best long-term interests of shareholders, as it ensures
director </font><font>accountability through the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose </font><font>proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or
</font><font>director candidates.</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> <div><font>BIS recognizes the critical importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s </font><font>financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board
</font><font>responsible for overseeing the management of the independent auditor and the internal audit function at a company.</font></div>
<div><font>We may vote against the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing.
We </font><font>look to public disclosures for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit </font><font>committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take
</font><font>particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we look for timely </font><font>disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</font></div> <div><font>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent </font><font>auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a
</font><font>significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice, we may also vote against ratification.</font></div>
<div><font>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms.
</font><font>We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</font><font>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Capital structure proposals</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Equal voting rights</font></div>
<div><font>In our view, shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. In addition,
companies </font><font>that have implemented dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis, or as </font><font>company circumstances change. Companies with multiple share classes should receive shareholder approval of their capital
</font><font>structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated </font><font>shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling
</font><font>structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Where companies are unwilling to voluntarily </font><font>implement </font><font>“</font><font>one share, one vote</font><font>”</font><font> within a specified timeframe, or are unresponsive to shareholder feedback for change over </font><font>time, we generally support shareholder proposals to recapitalize stock into a single voting class.</font></div> <div><font>Blank check preferred stock</font></div> <div><font>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion,
</font><font>dividend distribution, and other rights (</font><font>“</font><font>blank check</font><font>”</font><font> preferred stock) because they may
serve as a transfer of authority from </font><font>shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish </font><font>voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of </font><font>stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</font></div> <div><font>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the company:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Has committed publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover
purposes</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Has a history of
using blank check preferred stock for financings</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further
anti-</font><font>takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div><font>Increase in authorized common shares</font></div>
<div><font>BIS will evaluate requests to increase authorized shares on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with industry-specific
norms </font><font>and potential dilution, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares.</font></div>
<div><font>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</font></div>
<div><font>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
</font><font>dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</font></div>
<div><font>Stock splits</font></div>
<div><font>We generally support stock splits that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic
value of a </font><font>share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where </font><font>the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g., one class is reduced while others remain at pre-split
</font><font>levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not proportionately reduce the company’s authorized stock, </font><font>we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</font></div> <div><font>Mergers, acquisitions, transactions, and other special situations</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Mergers, acquisitions, and transactions</font></div>
<div><font>In assessing mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions – including business combinations involving Special
Purpose </font><font>Acquisition Companies
(</font><font>“</font><font>SPACs</font><font>”</font><font>) – BIS’ primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of our clients as </font><font>shareholders. Boards should
clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale for any proposed transactions or material </font><font>changes to the business. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the
degree to which it has the potential to </font><font>enhance long-term shareholder value. While mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, business combinations, and other special </font><font>transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such
</font><font>as:</font></div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The degree to
which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the </font><font>share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger
announcement. We may consider comparable </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div>
<div><font>transaction analyses provided by the parties’ financial advisors and our own valuation assessments. For companies
</font><font>facing insolvency or bankruptcy, a premium may not apply</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>There should be clear strategic, operational, and/or financial rationale for the combination</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Unanimous board approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider
whether the transaction </font><font>involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of an arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider </font><font>whether executive and/or board members’ financial interests appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders’ </font><font>interests before their own, as well as measures taken to address conflicts of interest</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>We prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial
advisor assessing the value of </font><font>the transaction to shareholders in comparison to recent similar transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div><font>Contested director elections and special situations</font></div>
<div><font>Contested elections and other special situations</font><font>22</font><font> are assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, </font><font>which may include: the qualifications and past performance of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the
</font><font>concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the ownership stake and </font><font>holding period of the dissident; the likelihood that the dissident’s strategy will produce the desired change; and whether the </font><font>dissident represents the best option for enhancing long-term shareholder value.</font></div> <div><font>We will evaluate the actions that the company has taken to limit shareholders’ ability to exercise the right to nominate
</font><font>dissident director candidates, including those actions taken absent the immediate threat of a contested situation. BIS may </font><font>take voting action against directors (up to and including the full board) where those actions are viewed as egregiously
</font><font>infringing on shareholder rights.</font></div> <div><font>We
will consider a variety of possible voting outcomes in contested situations, including the ability to support a mix of </font><font>management and dissident nominees.</font></div>
<div><font>Poison pill plans</font></div>
<div><font>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually.
Although </font><font>we have historically opposed most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable </font><font>“</font><font>qualifying offer clause.</font><font>”</font><font> Such </font><font>clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is </font><font>renewed. These clauses also tend to specify that an all-cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of </font><font>financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote or
</font><font>requires the board to seek the written consent of shareholders, where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. </font><font>We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be
</font><font>associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders. Lastly, we look for shareholder approval of poison </font><font>pill plans within one year of adoption of implementation.</font></div> <div><font>Reimbursement of expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</font></div> <div><font>We generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations
</font><font>where we support the shareholder campaign. Introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize disruptive </font><font>and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</font></div> <div><font>Executive compensation</font></div>
<div><font>A company’s board of directors should put in place a compensation structure that balances incentivizing, rewarding,
and </font><font>retaining executives appropriately across a wide range of business outcomes. This structure should be aligned with </font><font>shareholder interests, particularly the generation of sustainable, long-term value.</font></div> <div><font>The compensation committee should carefully consider the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals </font><font>the
board is focused on incentivizing. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate </font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>22</font></div>
<div><font>Special situations are broadly defined as events that are non-routine and differ from
the normal </font><font>course of business for a company’s shareholder meeting, involving a solicitation other than </font><font>by management with respect to the exercise of voting rights in a manner inconsistent with </font><font>management’s
recommendation. These may include instances where shareholders nominate </font><font>director candidates, oppose the view of management and/or the board on mergers, acquisitions, </font><font>or other transactions, etc.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>appropriate and rigorous performance metrics, consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. Performance-based
</font><font>compensation should include metrics that are relevant to the business and stated strategy and/or risk mitigation efforts. </font><font>Goals, and the processes used to set these goals, should be clearly articulated and appropriately rigorous. We use third party
</font><font>research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of </font><font>the compensation committee, or equivalent board members, accountable for poor compensation practices and/or
</font><font>structures.</font></div> <div><font>There should be a clear
link between variable pay and company performance that drives sustained value creation for our </font><font>clients as shareholders. Where compensation structures provide for a
front-loaded</font><font>23</font><font> award, we look for appropriate </font><font>structures (including vesting and/or holding periods) that motivate sustained performance for shareholders over a number </font><font>of
years. We generally do not favor programs focused on awards that require performance levels to be met and maintained </font><font>for a relatively short time period for payouts to be earned,
unless there are extended vesting and/or holding requirements.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Compensation structures should generally drive outcomes that align the pay of the executives with performance of the </font><font>company
and the value received by shareholders. When evaluating performance, we examine both executive teams’ efforts, </font><font>as well as outcomes realized by shareholders. Payouts to
executives should reflect both the executive’s contributions to the </font><font>company’s ongoing success, as well as exogenous factors that impacted shareholder value. Where
discretion has been used </font><font>by the compensation committee, we look for disclosures relating to how and why the discretion was used and how the </font><font>adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. While we believe special
awards</font><font>24</font><font> should be used sparingly, </font><font>we acknowledge that there may be instances when such awards are appropriate. When evaluating these awards, we consider </font><font>a
variety of factors, including the magnitude and structure of the award, the scope of award recipients, the alignment of the </font><font>grant with shareholder value, and the company’s
historical use of such awards, in addition to other company-specific </font><font>circumstances.</font></div> <div><font>We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help calibrate competitive pay; </font><font>however,
we are concerned when the rationale for increases in total compensation is solely based on peer benchmarking.</font></div>
<div><font>We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results – both financial and non-financial
– consistent </font><font>with the company’s strategic initiatives. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that </font><font>would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and
</font><font>other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practices. Our publicly available </font><font>commentary provides more information on our approach to executive compensation.</font></div> <div><font>Where executive compensation appears excessive relative to the performance of the company and/or compensation paid by </font><font>peers,
or where an equity compensation plan is not aligned with shareholders’ interests, we may vote against members of </font><font>the compensation committee.</font></div>
<div><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> advisory resolutions</font></div> <div><font>In cases where there is a </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> vote, BIS will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation </font><font>practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to
</font><font>shareholders. Where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance, we will vote against the
</font><font>management compensation proposal and relevant compensation committee members.</font></div> <div><font>Frequency of </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> advisory resolutions</font></div> <div><font>BIS will generally support annual advisory votes on executive compensation. It is our view that shareholders should have the
</font><font>opportunity to express feedback on annual incentive programs and changes to long-term compensation before multiple </font><font>cycles are issued. Where a company has failed to implement a </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> advisory vote within the frequency
period that </font><font>received the most support from shareholders or a </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> resolution is omitted without
explanation, BIS may vote </font><font>against members of the compensation committee.</font></div> <div><font>Clawback proposals</font></div>
<div><font>We generally favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial </font><font>reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </font><font>caused
material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </font><font>proceeding, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a
material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>23</font></div> <div><font>Front-loaded awards are generally those that accelerate the grant of multiple years’ worth of </font><font>compensation in a

settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically support </font><font>shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a
robust clawback policy that sufficiently addresses </font><font>our concerns.</font></div> <div><font>Employee stock purchase plans</font></div> <div><font>Employee stock purchase plans (</font><font>“</font><font>ESPP</font><font>”</font><font>) are an important part of a company’s overall human capital management strategy </font><font>and can provide performance incentives to help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common
</font><font>form of ESPP qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically support </font><font>qualified ESPP proposals.</font></div> <div><font>Equity compensation plans</font></div> <div><font>BIS supports equity plans that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of
</font><font>shareholders. Boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the </font><font>intended alignment with shareholder interests, such as the excessive pledging or heading of stock. We may support
</font><font>shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</font></div> <div><font>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and
</font><font>whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain </font><font>“</font><font>evergreen</font><font>”</font><font> provisions, which allow for automatic annual increases of shares available for grant without requiring further </font><font>shareholder
approval; we note that the aggregate impacts of such increases are difficult to predict and may lead to significant </font><font>dilution. We also generally oppose plans that allow for
repricing without shareholder approval. We may oppose plans that </font><font>provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may
not occur. </font><font>We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee </font><font>before acceleration or special payments are triggered (commonly referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>double trigger</font><font>”</font><font> change of control </font><font>provisions).</font></div>
<div><font>Golden parachutes</font></div>
<div><font>We generally view golden parachutes as encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to
</font><font>shareholders. However, a large potential payout under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a </font><font>management team to support a sub-optimal sale price for a company.</font></div> <div><font>When determining whether to support or oppose an advisory vote on a golden parachute plan, BIS may consider several </font><font>factors,
including:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Whether we determine that the triggering event is in the best interests of shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Whether management attempted to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The percentage of
total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than </font><font>shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Whether
excessively large excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Whether the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light </font><font>of
performance and peers</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Whether the golden
parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to </font><font>effectively manage the company It may be difficult to anticipate the results of a plan
until after it has been triggered; as a </font><font>result, BIS may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved </font><font>by shareholders when it was implemented.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>We may support shareholder proposals requesting that implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval.</font></div>
<div><font>Option exchanges</font></div>
<div><font>There may be legitimate instances where underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and
a </font><font>repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case basis. BIS may support a </font><font>request to reprice or exchange underwater options under the following circumstances:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual </font><font>company
performance</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Directors and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax,
</font><font>accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully contemplated</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>There is clear evidence that absent repricing, employee incentives, retention, and/or
recruiting may be impacted BIS may </font><font>also support a request to exchange underwater options in other circumstances, if we determine that the exchange is in </font><font>the best interests of shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>Supplemental executive retirement plans</font></div> <div><font>BIS may support shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in supplemental executive
</font><font>retirement plans (</font><font>“</font><font>SERP</font><font>”</font><font>) to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive </font><font>benefits beyond what is offered under employee- wide plans.</font></div> <div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that well-run companies, where appropriate, effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related
</font><font>risks and opportunities</font><font>25</font><font> as a core component of their long-term value creation for shareholder and business strategy. At the </font><font>board level,
appropriate governance structures and responsibilities allow for effective oversight of the strategic </font><font>implementation of material sustainability issues.</font></div>
<div><font>When assessing how to vote – including on the election of directors and relevant shareholder proposals –
robust disclosures </font><font>are essential for investors to understand, where appropriate, how companies are integrating material sustainability risks and </font><font>opportunities across their business and strategic, long-term planning. Where a company has failed to appropriately provide
</font><font>robust disclosures and evidence of effective business practices, BIS may express concerns through our engagement and </font><font>voting. As part of this consideration, we encourage companies to produce sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in
</font><font>advance of their annual meeting so that the disclosures can be considered in relevant vote decisions.</font></div>
<div><font>We encourage disclosures aligned with the reporting framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
</font><font>Disclosures (TCFD), supported by industry-specific metrics, such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting </font><font>Standards Board (SASB), now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial
</font><font>Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation.</font><font>26</font><font> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk </font><font>disclosures, the four pillars of the TCFD –
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets – are a useful way </font><font>for companies to disclose how they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of
sustainability-related risks and </font><font>opportunities. SASB’s</font><font>27</font><font> industry-specific metrics are beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>KPIs</font><font>”</font><font>) across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material. We recognize that some
</font><font>companies may report using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of private </font><font>standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</font></div> <div><font>We look to companies to:</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>25</font></div> <div><font>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value </font><font>creation in a
company’s business model that have an environmental or social dependency or </font><font>impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use,
</font><font>waste management, and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited </font><font>to, human
capital management, impacts on the communities in which a company operates, </font><font>customer loyalty, and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-run companies will
</font><font>effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant </font><font>to their
businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can oversee the creation </font><font>of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material
</font><font>sustainability-related considerations is a component of a sound governance framework.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div>
<div><font>26</font></div>
<div><font>The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation announced in November
2021 the formation of an International </font><font>Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality sustainability disclosure </font><font>standards to meet investors’ information needs. SASB standards will over time be adapted to ISSB standards but are the
</font><font>reference reporting tool in the meantime.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div>
<div><font>27</font></div>
<div><font>The ISSB has committed to build upon the SASB standards, which identify material,
sustainability-related disclosures across </font><font>sectors. SASB Standards can be used to provide a baseline of investor-focused sustainability disclosure and to implement </font><font>the principles-based framework recommended by the TCFD, which is also incorporated into the ISSB’s Climate Exposure
</font><font>Draft. Similarly, SASB Standards enable robust implementation of the Integrated Reporting Framework, providing the comparability </font><font>sought by investors.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

risk</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term
prospects. As such, as long-term </font><font>investors, we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </font><font>opportunities—just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities—and how these factors are </font><font>considered within their strategy in a manner that is consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, </font><font>we look for companies to disclose strategies that they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to
</font><font>their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global </font><font>warming is limited to well below 2°C, and considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</font><font>28</font><font> It is, of course, up to
</font><font>each company to define their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</font></div> <div><font>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by
</font><font>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </font><font>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </font><font>can
benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely, and equitable global energy </font><font>transition.</font><font>29</font><font> Yet, the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy
moving at different </font><font>speeds.</font><font>30</font><font> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition—in
</font><font>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </font><font>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosures a business plan for how they
</font><font>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </font><font>their business model and sector.</font></div> <div><font>We look to
companies to disclose short-, medium-, and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </font><font>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions
(GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </font><font>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to </font><font>use and contribute to the development of low carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing
</font><font>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </font><font>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition—and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </font><font>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy
</font><font>sources is consistent with their strategy.</font></div> <div><font>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory
</font><font>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </font><font>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize that these are provided on a good-faith</font><font>
basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to </font><font>climate risk and the global energy transition.</font></div>
<div><font>Natural capital</font></div>
<div><font>The management of nature-related factors is increasingly a core component of some companies’ ability to generate

<div><font>28</font></div>
<div><font>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of
aggregated </font><font>efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP have committed to move to net-zero over </font><font>the
coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us </font><font>to do so, we look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not

natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related risks. We look for such </font><font>companies to disclose</font><font>31</font><font> how they consider their reliance and use of natural capital, including appropriate risk
oversight and </font><font>relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures </font><font>to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as in our
</font><font>assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our
</font><font>approach to natural capital.</font></div> <div><font>Key stakeholder interests</font></div> <div><font>In order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, companies should also consider the interests of their key stakeholders.
</font><font>While stakeholder groups may vary across industries, they are likely to include employees; business partners (such as </font><font>suppliers and distributors); clients and consumers; government and regulators; and the constituents of the communities in
</font><font>which a company operates. Companies that build strong relationships with their key stakeholders are more likely to meet </font><font>their own strategic objectives, while poor relationships may create adverse impacts that expose a company to legal,
</font><font>regulatory, operational, and reputational risks.</font></div> <div><font>Companies should effectively oversee and mitigate material risks related to stakeholders with appropriate due diligence
</font><font>processes and board oversight. Where we determine that company is not appropriately considering their key stakeholder </font><font>interests in a way that poses material financial risk to the company and its shareholders, we may vote against relevant
</font><font>directors or support shareholder proposals related to these topics. Our publicly available commentary provides more </font><font>information on our approach.</font></div> <div><font>Conversely, we note
that some shareholder proposals seek to address topics that are clearly within the purview of certain </font><font>stakeholders. For example, we recognize that topics around taxation and tax
reporting are within the domain of local, state, </font><font>and federal authorities. BIS will generally not support these proposals.</font></div>
<div><font>Human capital management</font></div>
<div><font>A company’s approach to human capital management (</font><font>“</font><font>HCM</font><font>”</font><font>) is a critical factor in fostering an inclusive, diverse, and </font><font>engaged workforce, which contributes to business continuity,
innovation, and long-term value creation. Consequently, we </font><font>ask companies to demonstrate a robust approach to HCM and provide shareholders with disclosures to understand how </font><font>their approach aligns with their stated strategy and business model.</font></div> <div><font>Clear and consistent disclosures on these matters are critical for investors to make an informed assessment of a company’s </font><font>HCM practices. Companies should disclose the steps they are taking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion; job categories
</font><font>and workforce demographics; and their responses to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO-1 Survey. </font><font>Where we believe a company’s disclosures or practices fall short relative to the market or peers, or we are unable to ascertain </font><font>the board and management’s effectiveness in overseeing related risks and opportunities, we may vote against members of
</font><font>the appropriate committee or support relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more </font><font>information on our approach to HCM.</font></div> <div><font>Corporate political activities</font></div> <div><font>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to support public policy
</font><font>matters material to the companies’ long-term strategies. These activities can also create risks, including: the potential for </font><font>allegations of corruption; certain reputational risks; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory, and compliance
</font><font>considerations associated with corporate political spending and lobbying activity. Companies that engage in political </font><font>activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and mitigate risks, including board
</font><font>oversight.</font></div> <div><font>When depend on companies to
provide accessible and clear disclosures so that investors can easily understand how their </font><font>political activities support their long-term strategy, including on stated public policy
priorities. When presented with </font><font>shareholder proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, BIS will evaluate publicly available </font><font>information to consider how a company’s lobbying and political activities may impact the company. We will also evaluate
</font><font>whether there is general consistency between a company’s stated positions on policy matters material to their strategy and </font><font>the material positions taken by significant industry groups of which they are a member. We may decide to support a
</font><font>shareholder proposal requesting additional disclosures if we identify a material inconsistency or feel that further transparency </font></div> </div> <div>

<div><font>While guidance is still under development for a unified disclosure framework related
to natural </font><font>capital, the emerging recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>may clarify how the company’s political activities support its long-term strategy. Our publicly available commentary provides </font><font>more information on our approach to corporate political activities.</font></div> <div><font>General corporate governance matters</font></div> <div><font>IPO governance</font></div>
<div><font>Boards should disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon a company’s initial public offering
(</font><font>“</font><font>IPO</font><font>”</font><font>) are </font><font>in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also ask boards to conduct a regular review of corporate
governance and </font><font>control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances </font><font>change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our letter on unequal voting structures, we articulate our
</font><font>view that </font><font>“</font><font>one vote for one
share</font><font>”</font><font> is the preferred structure for publicly-traded companies. We also recognize the potential </font><font>benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, these structures should have
</font><font>a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and
</font><font>supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we think that such arrangements may not be in the best interests of </font><font>shareholders over the long-term.</font></div> <div><font>We may apply a
one-year grace period for the application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, </font><font>responsibilities on other public company boards and board
composition concerns), during which we ask boards to take steps </font><font>to bring corporate governance standards in line with our policies.</font></div>
<div><font>Further, if a company qualifies as an emerging growth company (an </font><font>“</font><font>EGC</font><font>”</font><font>) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of </font><font>2012 (the </font><font>“</font><font>JOBS Act</font><font>”</font><font>), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted under the JOBS </font><font>Act for the duration such
a company is categorized as an EGC. An EGC should have an independent audit committee by the </font><font>first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on auditors and
audit-related issues applicable in full for an </font><font>EGC on the first anniversary of its IPO.</font></div> <div><font>Corporate form</font></div>
<div><font>Proposals to change a corporation’s form, including those to convert to a public benefit corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>PBC</font><font>”</font><font>) structure, </font><font>should clearly articulate the stakeholder groups the company seeks to benefit and provide detail on how the
interests of </font><font>shareholders would be augmented or adversely affected with the change to a PBC. These disclosures should also include the </font><font>accountability and voting mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. We generally support management proposals </font><font>to
convert to a PBC if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Corporate form </font><font>shareholder proposals are evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.</font></div> <div><font>Exclusive forum provisions</font></div>
<div><font>BIS generally supports proposals to seek exclusive forum for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board
unilaterally </font><font>adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote against the </font><font>Independent Chair or Lead Independent director and members of the nominating/governance committee.</font></div> <div><font>Reincorporation</font></div>
<div><font>We will evaluate the economic and strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to reincorporate on a
case-by-case </font><font>basis. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protections under the new charter/articles/bylaws to </font><font>assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections are
</font><font>diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</font></div>
<div><font>Multi-jurisdictional companies</font></div>
<div><font>Where a company is listed on multiple exchanges or incorporated in a country different from their primary listing, we
will </font><font>seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific </font><font>proposals on the shareholder meeting agenda. In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s </font><font>primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs themselves, and the market context of each specific
</font><font>proposal on the agenda. If the relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional </font><font>judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. Companies should
</font><font>disclose the rationale for their selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, </font><font>particularly where there is conflict between relevant market governance practices.</font></div> <div><font>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>We generally support such proposals unless the agenda contains items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best </font><font>long-term economic interests.</font></div> <div><font>Bundled proposals</font></div>
<div><font>Shareholders should have the opportunity to review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept
</font><font>bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BIS may reject certain positive changes when </font><font>linked with proposals that generally contradict or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>Other business</font></div> <div><font>We

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Shareholder protections</font></div> <div><font>Amendment to charter/articles/bylaws</font></div> <div><font>Shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance </font><font>mechanisms
and amendments to the charter/articles/bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to </font><font>governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a reasonable
period of time, particularly if those changes have </font><font>the potential to impact shareholder rights (see
</font><font>“</font><font>Director elections</font><font>”</font><font>). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes </font><font>to the charter/articles/bylaws promotes cost and
operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we </font><font>may support such action if it does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s
corporate governance </font><font>structure.</font></div> <div><font>When
voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make changes to the charter/articles/bylaws, we will consider in </font><font>part the company’s and/or proponent’s publicly stated
rationale for the changes; the company’s governance profile and </font><font>history; relevant jurisdictional laws; and situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated
the proposed </font><font>changes, among other factors. We will typically support amendments to the charter/articles/bylaws where the benefits to </font><font>shareholders outweigh the costs of failing to make such changes</font></div> <div><font>Proxy access</font></div> <div><font>It
is our view that long-term shareholders should have the opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to </font><font>nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</font><font>32</font><font> Securing the right of shareholders to nominate directors without </font><font>engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, </font><font>encourage board attention to shareholder interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of directing that attention
</font><font>where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right </font><font>without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that the mechanism will not
</font><font>be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking </font><font>to take control of the board.</font></div> <div><font>In general, we support
market-standardized proxy access proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 </font><font>shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least
three years the right to nominate the </font><font>greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally </font><font>oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</font></div> <div><font>Right to act by written consent</font></div> <div><font>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of
</font><font>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </font><font>have the right to solicit votes by written consent provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent
</font><font>solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) </font><font>shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent.</font></div> <div><font>We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is </font><font>structured
for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the </font><font>board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the
waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act </font><font>by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent
if the </font><font>company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to </font><font>raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</font></div> <div><font>Right to call a special meeting</font></div> <div><font>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of
</font><font>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </font><font>have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of
</font><font>15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called. However, we may oppose this right </font><font>in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder, or where a lower threshold may lead to </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</font><font>way for companies to utilize technology to facilitate shareholder accessibility, inclusiveness, and cost efficiencies. </font><font>Shareholders should have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the meeting and interact with the board and </font><font>management
in these virtual settings; companies should facilitate open dialogue and allow shareholders to voice concerns </font><font>and provide feedback without undue censorship. Relevant shareholder
proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>A-34</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> </div> <div> <div><font>Appendix B
– Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</font></div> <div><font>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the
time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a </font><font>NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the
</font><font>ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a </font><font>particular subsequent date.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>NRSROs may rate specific investments (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds), issuers (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
corporations, governments and financial institutions) </font><font>and/or programs (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, commercial paper programs). However, certain types of investments may not be rated by NRSROs, </font><font>such as certain
government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial </font><font>institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For
these types of investments, as well as US Treasury </font><font>securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the
investment’s </font><font>issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same </font><font>NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal </font><font>securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings for the same security (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>underlying,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font> “</font><font>insured</font><font>”</font><font> and/or </font><font>“</font><font>enhanced</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</font></div>
<div><font>New issue securities (regardless of type) may not be rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary
</font><font>prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities may include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the </font><font>underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase
</font><font>a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: </font><font>(i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s </font><font>rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect </font><font>to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the performance of an index that includes credit ratings
eligibility criteria </font><font>as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined </font><font>by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may </font><font>differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are </font><font>not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index
</font><font>methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index,
</font><font>following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or </font><font>restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Fixed-income securities which are unrated may expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay
</font><font>principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the </font><font>investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Investors should note that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of
recent </font><font>developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Securities deemed to be high yield
are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</font></div> <div><font>The descriptions
below relate to general long-term and short-term obligations of an issuer.</font></div> <div><font>Moody’s
Ratings</font></div> <div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div>
<div><font>Aaa:</font><font> Obligations rated Aaa are judged
to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div> <div><font>Aa:</font><font> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>A:</font><font> Obligations rated A
are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Baa:</font><font> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such
may possess </font><font>certain speculative characteristics.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

credit risk.</font></div> <div><font>Ca:</font><font>
Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of </font><font>principal and interest.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>C:</font><font> Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div><font>Note:</font><font> Moody's appends numerical
modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The </font><font>modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category;
the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range</font><font> ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>

has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons </font><font>unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Should no rating be assigned, the
reason may be one of the following:</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>1. An application was not received or accepted.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</font></div>
<div><font>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the issue or issuer.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>4. The issue was privately placed,
in which case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</font></div> <div><font>Withdrawal may occur if new and
material circumstances arise, the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is </font><font>no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if
a bond is called for redemption; or for </font><font>other reasons.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Short-Term
Obligations</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations,
generally with </font><font>an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</font></div> <div><font>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</font></div> <div><font>P-1: </font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt
obligations.</font></div> <div><font>P-2:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div><font>P-3: </font><font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div> <div><font>NP:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div><font>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</font></div>
<div><font>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal obligations that are considered investment-grade and are </font><font>designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are
</font><font>designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation.</font></div> <div><font>MIG 1:</font><font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established
cash flows, highly </font><font>reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.</font></div>
<div><font>MIG 2:</font><font> This designation denotes
strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the </font><font>preceding group.</font></div>
<div><font>MIG 3:</font><font> This designation denotes
acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market </font><font>access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div> </div>

<div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>AAA:</font><font> An obligation rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s
capacity to meet its </font><font>financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>AA:</font><font> An obligation rated AA differs
from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet </font><font>its financial commitment is very strong.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>A:</font><font> An obligation rated A is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic
</font><font>conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation is still strong.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BBB:</font><font> An obligation rated BBB exhibits
adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing </font><font>circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial
commitment on the </font><font>obligation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:</font><font> Obligations
rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. </font><font>BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations
will likely have some quality and </font><font>protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BB:</font><font> An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing
</font><font>uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate </font><font>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>B:</font><font> An obligation rated B is more
vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the </font><font>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or
economic conditions will likely </font><font>impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>CCC:</font><font> An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, </font><font>and
economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse </font><font>business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not
likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>CC:</font><font> An obligation rated CC is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet </font><font>occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty,
regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div> <div><font>C:</font><font> An obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative
</font><font>seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div> <div><font>D:</font><font> An obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital
instruments, the D rating </font><font>category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that </font><font>such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the
</font><font>stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </font><font>of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An
</font><font>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div> <div><font>NR:</font><font> NR indicates no rating has been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a
rating, or that S&amp;P </font><font>Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div> <div><font>Note:</font><font> The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standing </font><font>within the major rating categories.</font><font> </font></div>

</a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>A-1: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The
obligor's capacity to meet </font><font>its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign </font><font>(+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div><font>A-2: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated
A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and </font><font>economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's
capacity to meet its financial </font><font>commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.</font></div> <div><font>A-3: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic
conditions or </font><font>changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation.</font></div> <div><font>B: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor
</font><font>currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead </font><font>to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</font></div> <div><font>C: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable
business, </font><font>financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div><font>D: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated D is
in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D </font><font>rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless
S&amp;P Global Ratings believes </font><font>that such payments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business </font><font>days will be treated as five business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </font><font>of a similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </font><font>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>An
S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks </font><font>unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less
will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more </font><font>than three years will most likely receive a long-term debt rating.</font></div>
<div><font>SP-1:</font><font> Strong capacity to pay
principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service </font><font>is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div><font>SP-2:</font><font> Satisfactory capacity to pay
principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes </font><font>over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div><font>SP-3:</font><font> Speculative capacity to pay
principal and interest.</font></div> <div><font>Fitch Ratings</font></div>
<div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>AAA:</font><font> Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned
only in cases of </font><font>exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected </font><font>by foreseeable events.</font></div> <div><font>AA:</font><font> Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for
</font><font>payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div> <div><font>A:</font><font> High credit quality. A ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of
financial commitments is </font><font>considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is </font><font>the case for higher ratings.</font></div>
<div><font>BBB:</font><font> Good credit quality. BBB ratings
indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of </font><font>financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions
are more likely to impair this </font><font>capacity.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BB:</font><font> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated
vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in </font><font>business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be
available to allow financial </font><font>commitments to be met.</font></div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div><font>CCC:</font><font> Substantial credit risk. CCC
ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</font></div> <div><font>CC:</font><font> Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>C:</font><font> Exceptionally high levels of
credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</font></div> <div><font>Defaulted obligations typically are not
assigned RD or D ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, </font><font>depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better
aligns obligations that have </font><font>comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</font></div>
<div><font>Note: The modifiers
</font><font>“</font><font>+</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>-</font><font>”</font><font> may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating
categories. Such </font><font>suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories </font><font>below CCC.</font></div> <div><font>The
subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The </font><font>designation is intended to make clear that the
rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant </font><font>to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in
all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for </font><font>analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is
to any degree subject to </font><font>market risk.</font></div> <div><font>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</font></div> <div><font>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or </font><font>security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the
</font><font>relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as
</font><font>“</font><font>short-term</font><font>”</font><font> based on </font><font>market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and
up to 36 </font><font>months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</font></div> <div><font>F1:</font><font> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of
financial commitments; </font><font>may have an added </font><font>“</font><font>+</font><font>”</font><font> to denote any exceptionally strong credit
feature.</font></div> <div><font>F2:</font><font> Good
short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div><font>F3:</font><font> Fair short-term credit quality.
The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened
</font><font>vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div> <div><font>C:</font><font> High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div>
<div><font>RD:</font><font> Restricted default. Indicates an
entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it </font><font>continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings
only.</font></div> <div><font>D:</font><font> Default.
Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</font></div>
