<div>Investment Objective</div>
<div>The iShares iBonds Dec 2023 Term
        Muni Bond ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of investment-grade U.S. municipal bonds maturing after December 31, 2022 and before December 2, 2023.</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
        transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
        performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 0% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
        investment results of the S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec 2023 Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of investment-grade (as determined by S&amp;P Dow
        Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)), non-callable U.S. municipal bonds maturing in 2023. As of October 31, 2019, there were 8,656 issues in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes
        municipal bonds primarily from issuers that are state or local governments or agencies such that the interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes. Each bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by
        S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”), or BBB- by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and must have a minimum maturity par amount of $2 million to be eligible for inclusion in
        the Underlying Index. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum par amount greater than or equal to $2 million, and must not be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”)
        as of</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>each rebalancing date. All bonds in the Underlying
        Index will mature after December 31, 2022 and before December 2, 2023. When a bond in the Underlying Index matures or is pre-refunded, the bond does not accrue interest past the maturity or pre-refunded date. An
        amount representing its value at the time of maturity or pre-refunding will be included in the Underlying Index throughout the remaining life of the Underlying Index, and any such amount will be assumed to earn a rate
        equal to the tax-exempt return of cash and cash equivalents. The Underlying Index is a market value weighted index and is rebalanced after the market close on the last business day of each month.</div>
<div>The Fund is a series of the iShares
        iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series of bond exchange-traded funds sponsored by BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). The
        iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series do not invest in U.S. savings bonds or other U.S. government bonds (except to the extent the
        funds hold cash equivalent instruments consistent with their investment objectives) and are not designed to provide protection against inflation.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
        indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
        positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
        that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better
        after-tax</div>

<div>performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
        low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
        indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
        to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental
        characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities
        in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at
        least 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund's operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures,
        options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the
        Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of
        the Underlying Index, and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included
        in the Underlying</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund
        track the Underlying Index. The Fund will generally hold municipal bond securities issued by state and local municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, the federal AMT and the
        federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income,” including dividends, interest and capital gains. In the last months of operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds
        will not be reinvested in bonds but instead will be held in cash and cash equivalents, including, without limitation, shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and
        obligations, tender option bonds and municipal commercial paper. These cash equivalents may not be included in the Underlying Index. By December 2, 2023, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash
        earned in this manner. Around the same time, the Fund will wind up and terminate, and its net assets will be distributed to then-current shareholders. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying
        Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by
        SPDJI, which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market
        value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this
        limitation, securities of the U.S.</font></div>

<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
        lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may
        adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the
        significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial
        market or other asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized
        Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders
        with</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>respect to the Fund and no other Authorized
        Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
        investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes
        in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk
        depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
        Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans</font></div>

        providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Declining Yield Risk.<font> During the final eleven months prior to the Fund's planned termination date, its yield will generally tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower
        than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</font></div>

        Amount Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that vary over
        time. It is expected that an investment in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity.
        Unlike a direct investment in municipal bonds, the breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment. For example, at times during the Fund's
        existence it may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which would result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than
        would otherwise be the case. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount
        you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects
        cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the
        illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s
        shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s
        NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk. <font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its
        portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
        investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
        ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may
        occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may
        cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged
        quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, reduced liquidity and
        increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased
        premiums or discounts to the Fund’s net asset value. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative
        interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>in heightened market volatility and detract from
        the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have
        increased, the Fund may have a very low, or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will
        generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including
        those held by the Fund. The historically low interest rate environment heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of
        underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. The Fund invests in municipal bonds of issuers that are primarily state or local governments or agencies. Changes
        to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged</font></div>

<div>
<div>market downturns. Local, regional or global events
        such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased
        premiums or discounts to the Fund’s net asset value.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
        volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Municipal securities can be significantly affected by political or economic changes, including changes made in the law after issuance of the securities, as well as
        uncertainties in the municipal market related to taxation, legislative changes or the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. Municipal securities backed by current or
        anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively affected by the inability to collect revenues from such projects or assets. Certain municipal securities are issued by entities with
        limited taxing authority such as school districts, or dependent on revenue from a particular sector or industry, such as the utilities sector, infrastructure sector, or transportation industry. In the event of a
        default or insolvency, certain issuers of municipal bonds may be subject to proceedings other than those specified by U.S. bankruptcy laws, which may impact the</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Fund’s ability to ultimately recover
        assets.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
        Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
        procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities to which
        the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that the Fund's income will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net
        investment income.”</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
        differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s
        holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or</font></div>

        requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of

<td>After-tax returns in the table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns
                    depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as
                    401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same
                    character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> James Mauro and Scott Radell (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a portfolio
        management team. Mr. Mauro and Mr. Radell have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since 2017.</font></div>
<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund
        (commonly referred to as an “ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of
        Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue
        or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The
        Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
        distributions primarily from net tax-exempt income, although distributions of taxable capital gains may also occur.<font> The Fund is generally not an appropriate investment for a 401(k) plan or an IRA</font>. Please consult your personal tax advisor.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
        Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
        through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
        intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.</div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important
        information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the
        Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other
        publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other
        instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or
        redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and
        trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund will wind up and terminate
        on or about December 1, 2023. Upon its termination, the Fund will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current shareholders
        pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In the final months of the Fund's operations, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation AMT-free
        tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and obligations, tender option bonds and municipal commercial paper. By December 2, 2023, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash earned in
        this manner. As the Fund approaches its termination date, its holdings of money market or similar funds may increase, causing the Fund to incur the fees and expenses associated with investing in these funds. In
        accordance with the Trust's current Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the Fund will terminate on or about the date noted above as approved by a majority of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the
        “Board”) without requiring additional approval by Fund shareholders. The Board may extend the termination date if a majority of the Board determines the extension to be in the best interest of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular
        segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation
        strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons,
        including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate</div>

<div>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing
        variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that
        apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such
        change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
        shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the
        divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing
        strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the
        securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under continuous listing standards
        adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying
        Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index,
        or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a
        bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and
        the Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund is subject to various
        risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of
        your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries,
        groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in

<div>general financial markets. This may cause the Fund
        to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
        redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
        and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
        delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk. <font>The Fund may be more susceptible to an increased risk of loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
        investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of issuers in a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may
        be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory
        occurrences than the market as a whole.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk.<font> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities will be unable
        or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s
        financial condition and on the terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their
        credit ratings downgraded or will default (</font><font>i.e., </font><font>fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income
        level or share price.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are
        susceptible to operational, information security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities
        in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks
        faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining
        unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
        Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on</font></div>

        particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by or
        breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and
        administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial
        losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption
        orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation
        costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund
        inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the
        event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that
        prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the
        Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Declining Yield Risk.<font> During the eleven months prior to the Fund's planned termination date, the bonds held by the Fund will mature and the Fund’s portfolio will convert to cash or cash equivalents.
        During these final eleven months, the Fund’s yield will generally tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than
        prevailing yields for bonds in the market. Any yield may be subject to federal and state income tax.</font></div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation
        Amount Risk. <font>The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that vary over time. It is
        expected that an investment in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity to those held by
        the Fund, but unlike a direct investment in municipal bonds, the breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment. The Fund may make
        distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which would result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the
        case. The breakdown between Fund distribution payments and the amount of liquidation proceeds may adversely affect the</font></div>

<div>tax characterization of your returns from an
        investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may experience a
        gain or loss for tax purposes. In addition, the yield on your investment (<font>i.e.</font>, the return on your purchase price) may be lower (or higher) than the Fund's published yields, which are based on the Fund's NAV.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or
        disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments
        may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional
        market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial
        market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during
        periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or
        instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although
        the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for
        other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants
        may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward
        pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund,
        which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.<font> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, as bonds in its portfolio
        mature or are near maturity, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted with cash and cash equivalents, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in
        the Underlying Index may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider.
        There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any</font></div>

<div>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the
        Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
        neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that
        the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index
        Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile
        the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by
        funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market
        exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its
        shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause
        the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility
        could mean that constituents that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the
        Underlying Index to vary from those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to unusual
        market conditions or in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the
        correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders.
        Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus was first detected in China in December 2019 and has spread globally. This outbreak has resulted
        in travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines,
        cancellations, supply chain disruptions, disruptions in markets, lower consumer demand, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty. Disruptions in markets can
        adversely impact the Fund and its investments, including impairing hedging activity to the extent a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no</font></div>

<div>longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund
        invests in short-term instruments that have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be impaired as a result. Further, certain local markets have been or may be subject to closures, and there can be no assurance
        that trading will continue in any local markets in which the Fund may invest, when any resumption of trading will occur or, once such markets resume trading, whether they will face further closures. Any suspension of
        trading in markets in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets. Any market or economic
        disruption can be expected to result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s net asset value. The outbreak could also impair the information technology and other operational
        systems upon which the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, rely, and could otherwise disrupt the ability of employees of the Fund’s service providers to perform critical tasks relating to the Fund.
        The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the entire global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. In the past,
        governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world have at times responded to major economic disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital
        infusions into companies and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and lower interest rates. An unexpected or sudden reversal of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase
        market volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments. Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future could have similar or other unforeseen effects. Public health crises caused
        by the outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be determined with certainty.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> As interest rates rise, the value of the fixed-income securities or other instruments held by the Fund is likely to decrease. A measure investors commonly use to determine this price
        sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter
        durations. To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline
        significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments,
        including those held by the Fund. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in
        certain fixed-income markets.</font></div>
<div>The historically low interest rate
        environment was created in part by the world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset purchase
        programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders.

<div>
<div>may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest
        rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to such
        interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low, or even negative
        yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates or begin phasing out, or
        “tapering,” accommodative monetary policy facilities in the future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on various markets is uncertain, and such changes in monetary
        policy may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>Changes in the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in
        general economic or political conditions can affect a security’s or instrument’s credit quality or value. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which
        the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a
        result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Market risk arises mainly from
        uncertainty about future values of financial instruments and may be influenced by price, currency and interest rate movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund may suffer through holding financial instruments
        in the face of market movements or uncertainty. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the
        issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or
        global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result
        in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s net asset value. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are
        generally less sensitive to such changes than are fixed-income securities with longer-term maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities
        and instruments. In addition, since many municipal securities are issued to finance similar projects, such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities, and water and sewer,
        conditions in these industries can affect the overall municipal market.</font></div>

<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by
        market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
        available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange
        or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in
        others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who
        trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less
        efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with
        more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund
        shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by
        extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to
        shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at
        Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates
        with changes in the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares
        and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during
        periods of significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the</font></div>

<div>
<div>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long
        term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely
        that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing
        reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during
        periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if
        there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund
        Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will
        likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the
        “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market
        liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider
        spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly
        from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Securities Risk.<font> Municipal securities include both general obligation bonds (bonds secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer) and limited obligation bonds (or “Revenue Bonds”). All
        municipal securities are subject to the risk that litigation, legislation or other political events, local business or economic conditions, credit rating downgrades, or the bankruptcy of the issuer could have a
        significant effect on an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and/or interest or otherwise affect the value of such securities. Additionally, certain municipal securities may be issued by entities with
        limited taxing authority, which could limit or prevent tax increases necessary to make continued payments of principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>Municipal securities can be
        significantly affected by political or economic changes, including changes made in the law after issuance of the securities, as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to taxation, legislative changes or
        the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect municipal issuers, including corruption related to a particular
        project from which payments on a security are derived, resulting in delays and cost overruns.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>There may be less publicly available
        information on the financial condition of municipal security issuers than for issuers of other securities. As a result, municipal securities may be more difficult for the Fund to value accurately than the securities
        of public companies. Municipal securities may also be harder to buy and sell compared to taxable bonds and non-municipal securities, especially on short notice. Because the Fund invests a significant portion of its
        portfolio in municipal securities, the Fund’s portfolio is subject to greater exposure to illiquidity risk than a fund that invests in comparable taxable bonds or non-municipal securities.</div>
<div>The Fund and BFA will rely on the
        opinion of issuers’ bond counsel on the tax-exempt status of interest on municipal bonds. Neither the Fund nor BFA will independently review the bases for those tax opinions, which may ultimately be determined
        to be incorrect, potentially resulting in the Fund and its shareholders being subject to substantial tax liabilities. In addition, changes in the financial condition of an individual municipal issuer can affect the
        overall municipal market.</div>
<div>Revenue Bonds are backed by current
        or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets and can be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the tax benefits supporting the project or assets or the inability to collect revenues from
        the project or the assets. Additionally, the market values of Revenue Bonds may decline in times of higher inflation to the extent that revenues are fixed income streams. In other instances, the prices that an issuer
        is able to charge users of its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for certain
        issuers, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the issuer’s revenues. Because many municipal securities are issued to
        finance projects, such as those related to education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities, and water and sewer, conditions in one or more of these sectors can affect the overall municipal market. Adverse
        conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to an issuer of the municipal securities and, by extension, adversely affect payments of principal and interest on, or the market
        value of, such securities.</div>
<div>Additionally, certain municipal
        securities are issued by entities dependent on revenue from a particular sector and thus are subject to the specific risks associated with that sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
        Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.<font> Entities that issue municipal securities related to infrastructure (“infrastructure issuers”) may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their capacity
        to make principal and interest payments, such as high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations,
        the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Such issuers
        may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly
        affected by government spending policies.</font></div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Leverage
        Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers can be highly indebted, which increases investment risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing, which could adversely affect such an issuer’s
        operations and the market value of related municipal securities in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Operations
        Risk.<font> The failure of an infrastructure issuer to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by
        environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory
        Risk.<font> Infrastructure projects may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service
        interruption due to environmental, operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset
        Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.,<font> major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable
        nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div>
<div>User Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a narrow user base. If these users do not patronize infrastructure projects as expected, significant revenues could be lost and may not be
        replaceable, in which case infrastructure issuers may fail to pay their obligations.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Municipal
        Securities Issued By School Districts.<font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school districts may
        be adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Municipal securities that are issued
        to finance a particular school district project often depend on revenues from ad valorem taxes (i.e., property taxes) to make principal and interest payments. Investors in these securities, similar to investors in
        municipal securities generally, face heightened risk of loss upon insolvency of the school district issuers because there is often no ready source of funding to pay principal and interest other than the local tax
        base, which a bankruptcy court or administrator does not control.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Transportation
        Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.<font> The transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and other operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, in many
        jurisdictions, the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project (e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues from that
        project to make principal and interest payments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Utility-Related
        Municipal Securities.<font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among</font></div>

<div>other things, finance the operation or expansion of
        utility entities. Various future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating
        costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of environmental and other governmental regulations. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. For example, gas utilities are subject to risks of supply
        conditions and increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term
        contracts for the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service
        providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
        these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative
        of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on
        U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as
        on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S. public debt level or the imposition of U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which the
        Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly
        strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries continue to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The
        U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> There is no guarantee that the Fund’s income will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment
        income.” The Index Provider relies on the bond issuer’s prospectus disclosure of the opinion from its counsel as to the tax-exempt status of the investment. Similarly, for municipal bonds not represented
        in the Underlying Index, BFA relies on prospectus disclosure of the tax opinion from the bond issuer’s counsel. Neither BFA nor the Fund guarantees that these opinions are correct, and there is no assurance that
        the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) will agree with the bond issuer’s counsel’s tax opinion. Issuers or other parties generally enter into covenants</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>requiring continuing compliance with U.S. federal
        tax requirements to preserve the tax-free status of interest payments over the life of the security. If at any time the covenants are not complied with, or if the IRS otherwise determines that the issuer did not
        comply with relevant tax requirements, interest payments from a security could become federally taxable, possibly retroactively to the date the security was issued, and the security could decline significantly in
        value. For municipal bonds not included in the Underlying Index, BFA will generally seek to obtain bonds that pay interest that is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT and the federal Medicare
        contribution tax. The interest on any money market instruments or other cash equivalents and any derivatives held by the Fund may be subject to federal, state and local income taxation and the federal Medicare
        contribution tax.</div>
<div>Events occurring after the date of
        issuance of a municipal bond or after the Fund’s acquisition of a municipal bond may result in a determination that interest on that bond is includible in gross income for U.S. federal, state and local income
        tax, federal AMT or federal Medicare contribution tax purposes retroactively to its date of issuance. Such a determination may cause a portion of prior distributions by the Fund to its shareholders to be taxable to
        those shareholders in the year of receipt. U.S. federal or state changes in income, federal AMT or federal Medicare contribution tax rates or in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal bonds less
        attractive as investments and cause them to lose value. If the IRS determines an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements, interest from the security could become taxable, even
        retroactively, and the securities could decline significantly in value.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
        between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of
        uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the
        distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of
        increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for
        securities or assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its
        shares, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Other
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to
        certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial
        Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to
        include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other
        derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is
        subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk
        and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or
        actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be
        restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the
        liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and
        increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain
        circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership
        restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts
        and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client
        accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's
        policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be
        found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment
        of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's
        investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive
        resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory
        Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with
        respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary
        expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust).</div>
<div>For its investment advisory services
        to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.18%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse
        fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street,
        San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock. As of December 31, 2019, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $7.43 trillion. BFA and
        its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for
        the approval by the Board of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's Annual Report for the period ended October 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> James Mauro and Scott Radell are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio
        management, including, but not limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of his portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment strategy, researching and
        reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his portfolio management team that have more limited responsibilities.</font></div>
<div>James Mauro has been employed by BFA
        or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since 2011. Prior to that, Mr. Mauro was a Vice President at State Street Global Advisors. Mr. Mauro has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2017.</div>
<div>Scott Radell has been employed by
        BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since 2004. Mr. Radell was a credit strategist from 2003 to 2004 and became a portfolio</div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which,
        through a subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”),
        and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund
        and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA,
        its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their
        interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager,
        commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect
        interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with
        and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other
        services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships
        or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity
        provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which
        an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to,
        distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to
        Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds</font></div>

        the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and
        closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940
        Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity
        having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate
        is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's
        investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more
        Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>In addition, the Fund may, from time
        to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by
        clients advised or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees,
        may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited
        because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its
        Affiliates and Entities and their respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and
        procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</div>

<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an
        exchange or other secondary market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other
        charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the
        “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally
        lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The
        Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the
        underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of
        not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change
        in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market
        timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national
        securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on
        which the Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.
        Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe BZX.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
        restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the
        limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares
        of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust, the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment
        companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of,
        and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>

<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund
        are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
        companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of
        stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC
        and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form.</div>
<div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand
        for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio
        value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information
        providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise
        composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a
        “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other
        market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in
        the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value.
        <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
        (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
        dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced
        closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and
        other assets and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>The Fund values fixed-income
        portfolio securities using last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices)</div>

<div>
<div>supplied by the Fund's approved independent
        third-party pricing services, each in accordance with valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board. Pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to
        derive values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller odd lot sizes.
        Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA
        determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S.
        securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
        securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not
        readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the
        Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market
        quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event
        subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant
        event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to
        the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith
        approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost
        to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be
        the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference
        between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the
        Underlying Index.</div>

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are
        declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is
        necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on
        shares of the Fund are distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds
        received from the Fund.</div>
<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for
        reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require
        beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole
        shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on
        current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in Fund
        shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax
        consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares. In general, given its investment strategy, the Fund would not be an appropriate investment for a tax deferred retirement account such as an IRA
        or a tax-exempt investor.</div>
<div>Taxes on Distributions.</div>
<div>Dividends paid by the Fund that are
        properly reported as tax-exempt interest dividends will not be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax. The Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will
        generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, including the federal AMT. Dividends paid by the Fund will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to
        the extent of the Fund’s tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds that are excluded
        from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as tax-exempt interest dividends. Exempt interest dividends from interest earned on municipal securities
        of a state, or its political subdivisions, may be exempt</div>

<div>from income tax in that state. However, income from
        municipal securities of other states generally will not qualify for tax-free treatment.</div>
<div>Distributions from the Fund’s
        net investment income other than from net tax-exempt income, including distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net
        long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares.
        Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Taxable distributions from the
        Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on “net investment income,” for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and
        trusts. Distributions from the Fund are not expected to qualify as qualified dividend income. In general, any taxable distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain
        distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Any market discount recognized on a
        bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount. To the extent the
        Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market
        discount.</div>
<div>If you lend your Fund shares
        pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as tax-exempt income. Consult your financial intermediary or tax
        advisor.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is
        currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS
        information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid
        withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers
        of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained;
        agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their
        account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
        entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out
        pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund.</div>

<div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen
        of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required
        certifications.</div>
<div>Shareholders will receive
        information after the end of each year setting forth the amount of dividends and long-term capital gains distributed to them by the Fund during the prior year. Likewise, the amount of tax-exempt income, including any
        tax-exempt income subject to AMT, that the Fund distributes will be reported and such income must be reported on the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return. The AMT is a separate tax system that operates
        in parallel to the regular federal income tax system but eliminates many deductions and exclusions. The AMT has different tax rates and treats as taxable certain types of income that are nontaxable for regular income
        tax purposes. The interest on certain “private activity” municipal bonds is taxable income for AMT purposes. If a taxpayer’s overall AMT liability is higher than regular income tax liability, then
        the taxpayer owes the regular income tax liability plus the difference between the AMT liability and the regular income tax liability.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital
        gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as
        long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in
        “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</font></div>
<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes
        some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and
        sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000
        shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the
        “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is
        subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for
        which cash may be substituted) (“Deposit Securities”) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. The composition of such
        portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the Fund. However, creation baskets will generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Fund. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer
        Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>

<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed
        only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund (“Fund Securities”) and a specified
        amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and
        redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>The Deposit Securities and Fund
        Securities, as applicable, in connection with a purchase or redemption of a Creation Unit, generally will correspond <font>pro rata </font>to the securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may
        create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or
        other interruption, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed
        at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</div>
<div>To the extent the Fund engages in
        in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any
        securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933
        Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities
        eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be
        made through a firm that is either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect
        to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption
        orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created
        and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some
        activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery
        and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that
        dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold
        allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the</div>

<div>Costs Associated with Creations and
        Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation
        Units. The standard creation and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant
        creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged
        to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable
        business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified) are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the
        table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based
        on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such services.</font></div>

<div>Householding.<font> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain
        shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in
        householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status.<br/>

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent
        distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the
        securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments
        to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain
        investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or
        indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options
        it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial
        incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other iShares funds over another
        investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>The financial highlights table is
        intended to help investors understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the
        rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in
        accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest
        bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or
        below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and
        demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the
        differences (expressed as a percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported
        NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the
        frequency of distributions of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2019.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the
        number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also
        shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the total returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total
        Returns” represents the average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods
        indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of
        one share of the Fund as calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the
        Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the
        Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the
        Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market
        Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of
        securities and therefore does not incur the expenses incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that
        may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
        would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth
        more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future results.</div>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock
        Fund Advisors (“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus
        for that Fund (each, an “Underlying Index”).</div>
<div>Each Fund offers and issues shares
        at their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities
        (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the
        “Cash Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges (a “Listing Exchange”) such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”) or NYSE Arca, Inc.
        (“NYSE Arca”). Shares of the Funds are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units, and,
        generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI). Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Portfolio Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI) typically are a specified number of shares, generally 50,000 or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to
        permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be
        issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 122%,
        which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than
        the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the
        requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>

<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing
        and trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>Shares of each Fund are listed for
        trading, and trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of
        the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things:
        (i) following the initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days,
        (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which the Fund is based is no longer calculated or available, or (iii) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes
        further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Fund or in the event a Fund does not comply with the
        continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s Prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other
        publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional
        information regarding the indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or
        through other widely disseminated means, an updated indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor. The Trust is not involved in
        or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has a fixed-income
        securities component and a cash component. The fixed-income securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit
        Securities required to be deposited in connection with the purchase of a Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Fund at a particular
        point in time because the current portfolio of the Fund may include securities that are not a part of the current Deposit Securities. Therefore, a Fund's IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours
        should not be viewed as a real-time update of the Fund's NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an
        IOPV consists of estimated accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to
        adjust the share prices of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on
        the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</div>
<div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its
        objective by investing primarily in both fixed-income securities issued by issuers that comprise the Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying
        Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s
        portfolio.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative
        sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment
        characteristics (based on market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying
        Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>

<div>Although the Funds do not seek
        leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Each Fund generally will invest at
        least 90% of its assets in the component securities of its Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund's operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures,
        options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the
        Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, each Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities
        of the Underlying Index, and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not
        included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index. Additionally, under normal circumstances, each Fund will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus
        the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). This policy is a fundamental
        policy of each Fund and may not be changed without a vote of a majority of such Fund’s outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>In addition, the Funds may invest
        any cash assets in one or more affiliated money market funds. In the last months of a Fund's operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested in bonds, but instead will be held in
        cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation, AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes (tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, tax and revenue anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes and bond
        anticipation notes); variable rate demand notes and obligations; tender option bonds; and municipal commercial paper, which will facilitate liquidation at the Funds' termination dates. These cash equivalents may not
        be included in the Underlying Index. </div>

<div>
<div>Bonds.<font>  Each Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company, or U.S. or
        non-U.S. governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified
        maturity date. Bonds generally are used by corporations and governments to borrow money from investors.</font></div>
<div>An issuer may have the right to
        redeem or “call” a bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower market rates. Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when
        bonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a “coupon” rate that is fixed for the life of the bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest
        rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls.
        When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that
        is less than its face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at
        face value, with the result that prices for such fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of bonds bear interest at an interest rate that
        is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar
        final maturities. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate movements than the
        value of fixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline if their interest rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter maturity for
        purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality
        issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on a
        corporation’s earnings and assets and, in the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured
        (backed by specified collateral).</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other
        transactions.</font></div>
<div>The purchase of securities while
        borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income.
        Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In
        addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced.
        BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</div>
<div>Certain types of borrowings by a
        Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that
        observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured
        within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>A fund classified as
        “diversified” under the 1940 Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of
        other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the
        outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its
        classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A non-diversified fund is a
        fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in
        particular industries) may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or
        subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by more diversified investment companies.</div>
<div>Each Fund (whether diversified or
        non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal
        Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders,
        provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it less
        likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>  Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that
        is maintained in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the
        Fund exceeds one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund
        receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan. Substitute payments
        received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are
        collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash
        collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities.
        Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA;
        such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities
        lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the
        extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC
        administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves
        exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If
        a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the
        collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the
        loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money
        if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be
        considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on
        tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>

<div>Liquidity Risk Management.<font>  Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the “Liquidity Rule”) requires open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to
        establish a liquidity risk management program (the “Liquidity Program”) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program,
        and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically
        reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a “highly liquid investment,”</font><font> “moderately liquid investment,”</font><font> “less liquid investment” or “illiquid investment.” The Liquidity Rule defines “liquidity risk” as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem
        shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading and
        investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as defined in the
        Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div>
<div>Ratings. <font> An investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”),
        S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”), or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be
        of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered “investment-grade” securities, bonds rated Baa are
        considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to meet financial
        commitments.</font></div>
<div>Subsequent to purchase by a Fund, a
        rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody’s or BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are generally considered
        below investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the
        terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly
        referred to as “junk bonds” and are subject to a substantial degree of credit risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch
        and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding
        Derivatives.<font>  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser
        either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”) or (ii) markets itself as providing
        investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the
        extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from
        the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to
        registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</div>
<div>Derivative contracts, including,
        without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and
        under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market are subject to
        variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in through 2020. Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading,
        reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory
        requirements under the 1940 Act, a Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of the Fund's obligations under the
        applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives contracts are settled on a physical basis, the Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the
        contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net basis, the Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets,</div>

<div>accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess,
        if any, of the Fund's obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to
        set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund was relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>
<div>The iShares iBonds Dec 2025 Term
        Muni Bond ETF (the “No-Action Letter Fund”) may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term
        “underlying fund” for purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate investment trusts
        (“REITs”), business development companies and, investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA has no
        transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the
        adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool operator” until six
        months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, has filed a claim with the CFTC for such
        fund to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of such fund.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the
        purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is
        construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in
        the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the
        collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement
        is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the
        ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain
        risks for a Fund, should it decide to utilize them. Such risks are not unique to the Fund, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. Each Fund seeks to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal
        uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality
        collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the
        counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to
        the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>  Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the
        characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase
        agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on
        the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the
        interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements
        may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund's exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a value equal to or greater than the Fund's
        obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional
        securities.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Securities of Investment Companies.
        <font> Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance.
        Under the 1940 Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the
        fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation,
        the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in
        excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be
        in addition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated
        as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro rata </font><font>share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary
        Investments.<font>   Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market
        instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds
        (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii)
        negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated,
        at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's, “F-1” by Fitch or “A-1” by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible
        corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the
        requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are
        of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained
        in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international
        transactions.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided
        they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not violate any investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and
        Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the
        principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus. An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may
        fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors
        does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk. <font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other
        fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk. <font> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by certain Funds may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and a Fund may
        have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features. Issuers of longer
        maturity securities may be more likely to call such securities as interest rates fall. As a result, the iShares iBonds Dec 2026 Term Muni Bond ETF's, iShares iBonds Dec 2027 Term Muni Bond ETF's and iShares iBonds Dec
        2028 Term Muni Bond ETF's investment in certain callable securities maturing outside the term of the Fund may increase the likelihood that securities held by the Fund are called prior to December 2 of the relevant
        year.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk.<font>  Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be
        sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant
        market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a
        Fund may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program
        will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font>  An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus was first detected in China in December 2019 and has spread globally. This outbreak has resulted in
        travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines,
        cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, as well as general concern and uncertainty. Further, certain local markets have been or may be subject to closures, and there can be no assurance
        that trading will continue in any local markets in which a Fund invests, when any resumption of trading will occur or, once such markets resume trading, whether they will face further closures. The suspension of
        trading in the countries in which a Fund invests will have an impact on a Fund and its investments, will impact a Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such local markets, and is expected to result in
        elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to a Fund’s net asset value. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the entire global economy, and may
        impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future could have similar impacts. In addition, the impact of
        infectious illnesses in emerging market countries may be greater due to generally less established healthcare systems. Public health crises caused by the outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social
        and economic risks in certain countries or globally. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be determined with certainty.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Insolvency Risk.<font>  Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn
        or recession. Should an issuer of securities held by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of
        a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain. Insolvency of municipal issuers exposes investors to increased uncertainty and risks as compared to corporate issuers because municipalities typically are not subject
        to formalized bankruptcy proceedings and there often is not a process whereby creditor claims can be considered and addressed.</font></div>
<div>During the period of a bankruptcy
        proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to
        whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed, and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as
        to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by each Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with
        respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by each Fund in connection with such plan of reorganization or restructuring will not
        have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral
        challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the expected outcome or introduce
        greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by each Fund could be
        re-characterized or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock (including
        convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. The value of equity
        securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry,
        deteriorate. Equity securities received by a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject
        a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</div>
<div>To the extent that each Fund
        receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, each Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of

<div>
<div>that each Fund could receive is an interest in one
        or more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Securities or other assets received
        in a reorganization or restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or
        downward pricing pressure after completion of the reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If each Fund
        participates in negotiations with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring with respect to securities of the issuer held by each Fund, each Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a
        period of time. If each Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund may have more active participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</div>
<div>Municipal Insurance. <font> A municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment of interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by
        either (i) the issuer at the time the bond is issued (primary market insurance), or (ii) another party after the bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</font></div>
<div>Both primary and secondary market
        insurance guarantee timely and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing
        its credit quality and value.</div>
<div>Municipal security insurance does
        not insure against market fluctuations or fluctuations in each of the Fund's share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security before maturity
        (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying agent, or (iii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption)
        or any other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the bond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may be a provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may
        be retired before maturity.</div>
<div>Because a significant portion of
        the municipal securities issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a significant adverse effect on the value of
        the securities insured by that insurance company and on the municipal markets as a whole.</div>
<div>Certain significant providers of
        insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise
        suffered extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are
        called upon to do so in the future. While an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if
        the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal security independent of
        insurance.</div>
<div>Municipal Market Disruption Risk.
        <font> The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the
        rights of municipal securities holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal securities are introduced before the U.S.
        Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, the
        availability of municipal securities and the value of a Fund’s holdings would be affected, and the Trustees would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are
        relatively rare, and certain provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. In many cases, there may be no bankruptcy proceedings available to handle claims in the
        face of a municipal issuer’s default or insolvency. Although the issuers of the majority of the bonds targeted for investment by each Fund is expected to have a comparatively higher credit rating than municipal
        bond issuers that have defaulted on their obligations, there can be no assurance that those issuers will not default. Further, the application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the
        states or among municipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of
        particular securities. Any of these effects could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Fund.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Municipal Securities. <font> The Funds invest in securities issued in the U.S. market by U.S. states and territories, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities
        of states and multi-state agencies or authorities (“municipal securities”), the interest payments of which are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. The municipal securities which the Funds may purchase
        include general obligation bonds and limited obligation bonds (or “Revenue Bonds”), including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law.</font></div>
<div>General obligation bonds are
        obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Revenue Bonds are payable only from the revenues
        derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source. Revenue Bonds that are issued to finance a particular project often
        depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities.
        Additionally, the market values of Revenue Bonds may decline in times of higher inflation to the extent that revenues are fixed income streams. In other instances, the prices that certain Revenue Bond issuers are able
        to charge users of their assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the issuer’s
        revenues. Additionally, rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for issuers of both general obligation bonds and Revenue Bonds, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment
        obligations.</div>
<div>The market for municipal bonds may
        be less liquid than for taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is
        generally characterized as a buy and hold investment strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and
        lessens as the securities move further away from such issuance date.</div>
<div>Some longer-term municipal
        securities give the investor the right to “put” or sell the security at par (face value) within a specified number of days following the investor’s request - usually one to seven days. This demand
        feature enhances a security’s liquidity by shortening its effective maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund
        would hold the longer-term security, which could experience substantially more volatility.</div>
<div>Municipal securities are subject to
        credit and market risk. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to
        fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</div>
<div>Prices and yields on municipal
        securities are dependent on a variety of factors, including general money-market conditions, the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular
        offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial
        condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not be as extensive as that which is made available by corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal securities may be more difficult to
        value than securities of public corporations.</div>
<div>Obligations of issuers of municipal
        securities are subject to insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or
        state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the
        risk that their tax treatment could be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a
        referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the payment of interest and principal on their municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found to be invalid
        or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing uncertainties in the market for municipal securities or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the
        credit risk with respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in the same manner.</div>
<div>Additionally, certain municipal
        securities are issued by entities dependent on revenue from a particular sector and thus are subject to the specific risks associated with that sector. These sectors are described in more detail below.</div>

<div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Health
        Care-Related Municipal Securities. <font>Changes to state or federal policy tied to health care services could adversely affect the value of municipal securities backed by revenue from public hospitals and other health care
        facilities. Regulatory changes that govern cost reimbursements to health care providers under government-funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, including policies that award exclusive contracts to certain
        hospitals, may adversely affect the revenue streams backing certain municipal securities. Additionally, the expansion of healthcare facilities by some issuers may be subject to “determinations of need” by
        various regulators or other authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and expenses such expansions entail, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, thus potentially limiting the revenue and
        growth of healthcare facility operators. Moreover, local, state and federal governmental bodies are under increasing pressure to reduce medical spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect
        regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare services and facilities. The value of healthcare-related municipal securities could also be affected by a variety of other factors that impact the
        underlying healthcare facilities including demand for services, the ability of the health care facility to provide the services required, competition with other facilities, and expenses (such as malpractice insurance
        premiums).</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
        Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.<font> Entities that issue municipal securities related to infrastructure (“infrastructure issuers”) may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their capacity
        to make principal and interest payments, such as high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations,
        the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Such issuers
        may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly
        affected by government spending policies.</font></div>
<div>Leverage
        Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers can be highly indebted, which increases investment risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing, which could adversely affect such an issuer’s
        operations and the market value of related municipal securities in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Operations
        Risk.<font> The failure of an infrastructure issuer to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by
        environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory
        Risk.<font> Infrastructure projects may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service
        interruption due to environmental, operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset
        Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers may control significant strategic assets (e.g., major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic
        characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or
        adverse political actions.</font></div>
<div>User Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a narrow user base. If these users do not patronize infrastructure projects as expected, significant revenues could be lost and may not be
        replaceable, in which case infrastructure issuers may fail to pay their obligations.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Municipal
        Securities Issued By School Districts.<font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school districts may
        be adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Investors in these securities, similar
        to investors in municipal securities generally, face heightened risk of loss upon insolvency of the school district issuers because there is often no ready source of funding to pay the bonds other than the local tax
        base, which a bankruptcy court or administrator does not control.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Transportation
        Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.<font> The transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and other operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, in many
        jurisdictions, the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project (e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues from that
        project to make principal and interest payments.</font></div>

<div>Risk of Investing in
        Utility-Related Municipal Securities.<font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities.
        Various future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in
        demand for services and the effects of environmental and other governmental regulations. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. For example, gas utilities are subject to risks of supply conditions and
        increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for the
        purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</font></div>
<div>The types of municipal securities
        in which the Funds may invest include, but are not limited, to the following:</div>
<div>Industrial Development Bonds</div>
<div>Industrial development bonds
        generally are also Revenue Bonds and thus are not payable from the issuer’s general revenues. The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the
        facilities. Payment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any guarantor).</div>
<div>Private Activity Bonds</div>
<div>The Funds may invest in private
        activity bonds, which are bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities, sewage disposal, solid waste
        disposal or hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for the
        construction, equipment, repair or improvement of privately operated industrial or commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the current U.S. federal tax laws place substantial limitations
        on the size of such issues.</div>
<div>Municipal Notes</div>
<div>Municipal notes (also known as
        municipal commercial paper) are shorter-term municipal debt obligations. They may provide interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants, bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall
        in the anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may be delayed or the note may not be fully repaid, and the Funds may lose money.</div>
<div>Municipal commercial paper is
        generally unsecured and issued to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only
        out of the assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors are repaid.</div>
<div>New or Unseasoned Municipal
        Issuers. <font> A Fund may invest in municipal securities issued by entities that have not previously issued securities or that do not have an extensive history of issuing securities. Information
        regarding these issuers may be more limited than for other issuers. Securities of these issuers may be subject to volatility in their prices and may have a limited trading market, which could adversely affect a
        Fund’s ability to dispose of them and could reduce the price a Fund might be able to obtain for them.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external
        processes, or systems or technology failures, that could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of
        operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of
        service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other
        Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.</font></div>
<div>Repurchase Agreement Risk. <font> A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Repurchase agreements may be construed to
        be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities</font></div>

<div>transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase
        agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase
        price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security
        and the market value of the security declines, a Fund may lose money.</div>
<div>Risk of Derivatives. <font> A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a
        currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and tender option bonds, which may be
        considered derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in
        derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual
        obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives,
        such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</font></div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a
        hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging
        can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge.
        Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs,
        will be effective.</div>
<div>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal
        Securities. <font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of each Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as
        general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in shares is
        made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund
        shares. In general, given its investment strategy, the Fund would not be an appropriate investment for a tax deferred retirement account such as an IRA or a tax-exempt investor.</div>
<div>In response to the national
        economic downturn in recent years, governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing
        significant reductions in revenues and are consequently experiencing difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their
        outstanding debt and may experience ratings downgrades of their debt.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S. <font> Decreasing imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed
        on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well
        as on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S. public debt level or U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which a Fund has
        exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly
        strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also
        experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which a Fund invests.</div>

<div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For all Funds, the Board has
        delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BFA has adopted policies and
        procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting
        Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders,
        on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that
        might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural
        separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or
        dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an
        independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div>
<div>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy
        Voting Policy, the BlackRock Global Proxy Voting Policies and the BlackRock U.S. Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendices A1, A2 and A3, respectively.</div>
<div>Information with respect to how
        proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds'
        website at <font>www.iShares.com</font>; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy
        regarding the disclosure of the Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests
        of each Fund’s shareholders; (ii) does not put the interests of BFA, the Distributor or any affiliated person of BFA or the Distributor, above those of Fund shareholders; (iii) does not advantage any current or
        prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund shareholders, except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not available to other
        current or prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary for transactions in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided to personnel of
        BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of a Fund for the purpose of facilitating risk management and hedging activities; and (iv) does not provide
        selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting the use of such information are in effect. The
        “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based subscription services,
        large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and market
        makers and other institutional market participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's
        portfolio holdings information is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to
        those other fee-based subscription services, including market makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming
        Creation Units or trading shares of the Funds in the secondary market or evaluating such potential transactions. This information typically reflects each Fund’s anticipated holdings on the following business
        day.</div>
<div>Daily access to information
        concerning the Funds' portfolio holdings is permitted: (i) to certain personnel of those service providers that are involved in portfolio management and providing administrative, operational, risk management, or other
        support to portfolio management; and (ii) to other personnel of the Funds' investment adviser, the Distributor and their affiliates, and the administrator, custodian and fund accountant who deal directly with, or
        assist in, functions related to investment management, distribution, administration, custody, securities lending and fund accounting, as may be necessary to conduct business in the ordinary course in a manner
        consistent with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. In</div>

<div>addition, each Fund discloses its portfolio
        holdings daily at <font>www.iShares.com</font>. More information about this disclosure is available at <font>www.iShares.com</font>.</div>
<div>Portfolio holdings information made
        available in connection with the creation/redemption process may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds in the ordinary course of business after it has been disseminated to the NSCC. From
        time to time, information concerning portfolio holdings other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, may be provided to other
        entities that provide services to the Funds, including rating or ranking organizations, in the ordinary course of business, no earlier than one business day following the date of the information.</div>
<div>Each Fund will disclose its
        complete portfolio holdings schedule in public filings with the SEC within 70 days of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters and within 60 days of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters and will
        provide such information to shareholders as required by federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. Each Fund may, however, voluntarily disclose all or part of its portfolio holdings other than in connection
        with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, in advance of required filings with the SEC, provided that such information is made generally available to all shareholders and other interested parties in a
        manner that is consistent with the above policy for disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Such information may be made available through a publicly available website or other means that make the information
        available to all likely interested parties contemporaneously.</div>
<div>The Trust's Chief Compliance
        Officer or his delegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio holdings information pursuant to the above policy and procedures, subject to restrictions on selective disclosure imposed by applicable law.</div>
<div>The Board reviews the policy and

<div>Construction and Maintenance of
        the Underlying Index</div>
<div>A description of the Underlying
        Indexes are provided below.</div>
<div>With respect to certain underlying
        indexes of the iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed
        investment concepts and strategies that could be considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted such indices using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the
        relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its sole discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the
        rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the underlying index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also
        provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or pursuant to other communications with the index provider.</div>
<div>The S&amp;P Fixed Income
        Indexes</div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> General oversight responsibility for the Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&amp;P”) indexes, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled
        by an S&amp;P Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P Dow Jones
        Indices LLC (“S&amp;P DJI”) staff specialized in the various fixed-income markets. Public announcements of index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in
        advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Maintaining the S&amp;P Fixed Income Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for bond additions and deletions, par amount changes, rating changes and corporate actions.
        Each S&amp;P Fixed Income Index is a market-value weighted index. Securities Evaluations/ICE Data Services, the pricing division of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), reports the price of each bond
        in the index each day. The prices used in the index calculation will add the accrued interest for each bond to the price reported by S&amp;P. The total return is calculated by aggregating the interest return,
        reflecting the return due to paid and accrued interest, and principal return, reflecting the capital gains or losses due to changes in S&amp;P's end-of-day price and principal repayments and the reinvestment return,
        excluding the reinvestment of related cash flows.</font></div>

<div>Each index is generally reviewed and rebalanced on
        a monthly basis. The S&amp;P Index Committee, nevertheless, reserves the right to make adjustments to each index at any time that it believes appropriate. Additions, deletions and other changes to each index arising
        from the monthly rebalancing are published three business days prior to the last business day of the month (the Announcement Date). Publicly available information, up to and including the close on the fourth business
        day preceding the Rebalancing Date, is considered in the rebalancing. Index changes published in the announcement will not normally be subject to revision and will become effective after the close. Any index bond that
        is downgraded below investment grade between rebalancing dates is removed at the next rebalancing date.</div>

<div>Index Availability.<font> All S&amp;P Fixed Income Indexes are calculated at the end of the business day. Most S&amp;P Indexes are available from major data vendors.</font></div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.<font> Eligible bonds are approved by the S&amp;P Index Committee that oversees the management of the Underlying Index and are added to the Underlying Index on the next Rebalancing Reference

<div>S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec
        2021 Index<sup>TM</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 12,817</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Dec 2021 Index<sup>TM</sup> is a broad, comprehensive, market value weighted index designed to measure the performance of investment-grade,
        non-callable U.S. municipal bonds maturing in 2021. As of October 31, 2019, the Underlying Index consisted of 12,817 bonds, with a total market value of approximately $115.1 billion.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology.<font> In order for a bond to be classified as eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, a bond must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is a state or local government
        or agency such that interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes and the federal AMT as determined by the Index Provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be denominated in U.S.
        dollars; (iii) the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody's, or BBB- by Fitch. A bond must be rated by only one of these three rating agencies in order to qualify for the
        index. A bond with an “expected” rating, as denoted by data providers, of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch will qualify for the index as well. For the
        avoidance of doubt, the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment grade; and (iv) each bond in the Underlying Index must have a minimum maturity par amount of $2 million to be eligible for
        inclusion. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum maturity par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of each rebalancing date and must maintain a minimum maturity par amount greater
        than or equal to $2 million as of six days prior to last Business Day of each month (“Rebalancing Reference Date”); (v) Securities Evaluations | ICE Data Services must provide daily pricing on the bond;
        and (vi) New additions must have a dated date later than December 31, 2010 to be eligible for index inclusion. “Business Day” is defined as any day that U.S. municipal bonds are traded, as determined by
        The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and/or the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). All bonds in the Underlying Index will mature after December 31, 2020 and before December 2, 2021.
        When a bond that is included in the Underlying Index matures, its maturity value will be represented in the Underlying Index by cash throughout the remaining life of the Underlying Index. By December 2, 2021, the
        Underlying Index value will be represented by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying Index. At each monthly rebalancing, no index constituent can represent more than 30% of the weight of the Underlying
        Index, and the five highest weighted index constituents do not account for more than 65% of the weight of the index in aggregate. The following types of bonds are specifically excluded from the Underlying Index: bonds
        subject to AMT, bonds with early redemption dates (callable provisions), tobacco bonds, non-rated bonds, notes, taxable municipals, variable rate debt, commercial paper, derivative securities (inverse floaters,
        forwards, and swaps), conduit bonds where the obliger is a for-profit institution, health care bonds, housing bonds and industrial bonds.</font></div>

<div>S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series
        Callable-Adjusted Dec 2026 Index<sup>TM</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 4,393</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series Callable-Adjusted Dec 2026 Index<sup>TM</sup> is a broad, comprehensive, market value weighted index designed to measure the performance of investment-grade,
        non-callable and callable U.S. municipal bonds expected to mature or be redeemed after December 31, 2025 and prior to December 2, 2026. As of October 31, 2019, the Underlying Index consisted of 4,393 bonds, with a
        total market value of approximately $47.3 billion.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology.<font> In order for a bond to be classified as eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, a bond must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is a state, federal district, or
        local government or agency such that interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes and the federal AMT as determined by the Index Provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be
        denominated in U.S. dollars; (iii) the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch. A bond must be rated by only one of these three rating agencies in
        order to qualify for the index. A bond with an “expected” rating, as denoted by data providers, of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch will qualify for the
        index as well. For the avoidance of doubt, the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment grade; and (iv) each bond in the Underlying Index must have a minimum maturity par amount of $2 million
        to be eligible for inclusion. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum maturity par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of each rebalancing date and must maintain a minimum maturity
        par amount greater than or equal to $2 million as of four days prior to last Business Day of each month (“Rebalancing Reference Date”); (v) Securities Evaluations | ICE Data Services must provide daily
        pricing on the bond; and (vi) new additions must have a dated date later than December 31, 2010 to be eligible for index inclusion. “Business Day” is defined as any day that U.S. municipal bonds are
        traded, as determined by The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and/or the NYSE. All non-callable bonds in the Underlying Index will mature or be redeemed after December 31, 2025 and before December
        2, 2026. Callable bonds are eligible subject to the following: (i) a final maturity date after December 31, 2025 and before December 2, 2026, and a next call date no sooner than two years prior to final maturity; or
        (ii) a final maturity date up to four years after the index maturity year, if the next call date is within the index maturity range. When a bond that is included in the Underlying Index matures, its value will be
        represented in the Underlying Index by cash and/or cash equivalents throughout the remaining life of the Underlying Index. By December 2, 2026, the Underlying Index value will be represented by cash as no securities
        will remain in the Underlying Index. At each monthly rebalancing, no index constituent can represent more than 30% of the weight of the Underlying Index, and the five highest weighted index constituents do not account
        for more than 65% of the weight of the index in aggregate. The following types of bonds are specifically excluded from the Underlying Index: bonds subject to AMT, tobacco bonds, non-rated bonds, notes, taxable
        municipals, variable rate debt, commercial paper, derivative securities (inverse floaters, forwards, and swaps), and conduit bonds where the obliger is a for-profit institution.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Outside of five years prior to the term of the Fund, the Underlying Index will be market value weighted. Five years prior to the term of the Fund, monthly rebalances occurring in rolling
        two year periods will remove bonds with a maturity year outside the term of the Fund from the Underlying Index. Such rebalancing will begin with those bonds whose effective maturity date is furthest from that of the
        Underlying Index. As a result, as of December 31, 2025, the Underlying Index will not contain bonds with an effective maturity date later than December 2, 2026.</font></div>

        fundamental policies the following numbered investment policies, which cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority of the
        outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in the Investment Company Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the
        outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund has also adopted certain non-fundamental investment
        policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental investment policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Therefore, each Fund may change its investment objective and its Underlying
        Index without shareholder approval.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>The following notations are not
        considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of
        25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of
        concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit
        investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies,
        instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry.
        There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their activities are primarily
        related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes
        any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad
        authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to
        borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the
        Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s
        total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.”
        Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance
        with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when each Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into an
        offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be
        interpreted to permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each
        Fund to segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements
        with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the
        policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact,
        in the case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount
        of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed
        the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application
        of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause each Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions
        involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the
        extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit
        funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral
        arrangements with respect to options, forward</div>

<div>Non-Fundamental Investment
        Policies</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
        purposes, in component securities in each Fund's Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If,
        subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Funds into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase shares of any
        registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each Fund
        has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</div>
<div>Unless otherwise indicated, all
        limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain
        securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable
        to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax consequences.</div>
<div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units
        are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such
        term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a
        distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm
        or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it
        chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act
        must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete
        description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also
        note that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is
        because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery
        obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in
        connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is
        available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div>

<div>Management</div>
<div>Trustees and Officers. <font> The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each
        Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or
        removal. Trustees who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (“Independent Trustees”).</font></div>
<div>The registered investment companies
        advised by BFA or its affiliates (the “BlackRock-advised Funds”) are organized into one complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds (the “BlackRock Multi-Asset
        Complex”), one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (the “BlackRock Fixed-Income Complex”) and one complex of ETFs (“Exchange-Traded Fund Complex”) (each,
        a “BlackRock Fund Complex”). Each Fund is included in the BlackRock Fund Complex referred to as the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee of
        iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists of 366 funds as of February 28, 2020. With the exception of Robert S. Kapito, Salim Ramji and
        Charles Park, the address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito, Mr. Ramji and Mr. Park is c/o BlackRock, Inc., Park Avenue Plaza, 55
        East 52<sup>nd</sup> Street, New York, NY 10055. The Board has designated Cecilia H. Herbert as its Independent Board Chair. Additional
        information about the Funds' Trustees and officers may be found in this SAI, which is available without charge, upon request, by calling toll-free 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>

<div>The Board has concluded that, based
        on each Trustee’s experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, each Trustee should serve as a Trustee of the Board. Among the
        attributes common to all Trustees are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the Funds' investment adviser, other service
        providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. A Trustee’s ability to perform his or her
        duties effectively may have been attained through the Trustee’s educational background or professional training; business, consulting, public service or academic positions; experience from service as a Board
        member of the Funds and the other funds in the Trust (and any predecessor funds), other investment funds, public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations; and/or other life experiences. Also, set forth
        below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Trustee that led the Board to conclude that he or she should serve (or continue to serve) as a Trustee.</div>

<div>
<div>Overall responsibility for
        oversight of the Funds rests with the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds
        in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees.
        The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that
        may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an
        Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees
        generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance
        Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the
        business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain
        specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers,
        officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The
        Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board
        to exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with
        respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment,
        compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not
        possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and
        operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are
        specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate
        risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as
        operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the
        Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance
        program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program,
        the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the
        Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as
        needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to
        time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</div>
<div>Committees of the Board of
        Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), John E. Kerrigan and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee
        are to assist the Board (i) in its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight
        of the Trust's financial statements and the independent audit thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to
        be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); (iv) in evaluating the independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements</font></div>

        consider Board nominations recommended by shareholders (acting solely in their capacity as a shareholder and not in any other capacity). The Nominating and Governance Committee met one time during the fiscal year
        ended October 31, 2019.</div>

<div>Potential Conflicts of Interest.
        <font> The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”), through a subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock, Inc., the parent of BFA, the Funds' investment
        adviser. Certain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to in this section as “BlackRock”) and PNC and its subsidiaries (collectively
        referred to in this section as the “Entities”), and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities, may give rise to
        actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's
        largest asset management firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective subsidiaries and each of their respective
        directors, officers and employees, including, in the case of BlackRock, the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged
        worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds.
        These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential
        multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities have
        proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those
        of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock and the Entities are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and
        fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock and the Entities are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities,
        currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact
        on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more
        or less favorable than those obtained by the Fund.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or
        sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases,
        this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or the Entities may have the
        effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>respect to small-capitalization, emerging market
        or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support decisions for
        other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity
        constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be
        disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including
        purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div>
<div>Conflicts may also arise because
        portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security
        sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held
        by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds
        that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and redemptions, and increased remuneration and
        profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances,
        BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients
        (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There
        may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially
        conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable
        rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities and
        their respective clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity
        and terms of the Fund's investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or the Entities or their respective clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms
        that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s
        investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages
        or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a
        Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also
        possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be
        restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Entities or other
        accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or an Entity for clients worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and the Entities designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for
        example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Entities are performing services or when
        position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock or one or more Entities for their proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities
        for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management
        of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a
        Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or
        strategies used for other accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have</div>

<div>
<div>access to such information for the purpose of
        managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions
        and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in
        investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment
        management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of the Fund by model-driven investment
        portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and
        certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such
        other business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into
        transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or an Entity, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or an Entity,
        serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund
        obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or an Entity.</div>
<div>BlackRock or one or more Entities
        may also create, write or issue derivatives for their clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. BlackRock has
        entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares
        funds. BlackRock will receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include
        payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could
        contribute to the viability of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such
        derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable
        law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock or one or more Entities and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock or an Entity where such
        other clients have interests adverse to those of the Fund.</div>
<div>At times, these activities may
        cause business units or entities within BlackRock or an Entity to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted,
        a Fund will deal with BlackRock and/or Entities on an arm’s-length basis.</div>
<div>To the extent authorized by
        applicable law, BlackRock or one or more Entities may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,
        financial advisory fees, underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock or an Entity
        will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock and each Entity, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock or the Entity
        and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds also may use an index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of the Fund or BlackRock that acts as a
        broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law,
        BlackRock and the Entities (and their personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent,
        lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or its shareholders will be reduced by
        reason of receipt by BlackRock or an Entity of any such fees or other amounts.</div>

<div>
<div>When BlackRock or an Entity acts as
        broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock or the Entity may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund
        will be required to establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's
        establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant
        to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash
        collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to
        increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending
        agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients
        with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate <font>pro rata </font>allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending
        program, BlackRock indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar
        exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA
        also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific
        credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using
        loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may further adjust other securities lending program attributes
        by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending activity BlackRock may conduct
        at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined
        systematic process in order to approximate <font>pro rata</font> allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits
        (<font>i.e.,</font> indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending
        portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending
        opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes
        for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by the firm.</div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities
        and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different
        research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or
        aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity
        frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or
        credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same
        commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law,
        BlackRock may select brokers (including, without limitation, certain Entities) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with
        research or other appropriate services which provide, in BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and
        OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by law, research reports on companies, industries and</div>

        or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the research or other service
        arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock
        client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive
        the benefit, including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the
        extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</div>
<div>BlackRock does not currently enter
        into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a
        particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by
        client commissions that also will be used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law,
        may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are
        useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also
        enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where permitted, an Entity, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the
        commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft

<div>BlackRock may utilize certain
        electronic crossing networks (“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or an Entity has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing
        client securities transactions for certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions
        or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even
        though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by
        BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and
        procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in
        accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the
        interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or an Entity, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more
        detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div>
<div>It is also possible that, from time
        to time, BlackRock or an Entity may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification
        and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the Entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in
        Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or an Entity could
        significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing
        requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other shareholders in deciding whether to redeem its shares but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may
        invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies with which an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or an
        Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests or in which an Entity makes a market. A Fund may also</div>

<div>invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by
        entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with,
        companies to which an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. Such investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other
        clients of BlackRock or an Entity. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these
        activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock or an Entity may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. When an Entity is engaged in an underwriting or other
        distribution of securities of an entity, BlackRock may be prohibited from purchasing or recommending the purchase of certain securities of that entity for a Fund. As indicated below, BlackRock or an Entity may engage
        in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock or of an Entity have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited
        (“Chubb”), a public company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has
        approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages
        the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain
        BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co transaction.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities, their
        personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and the Entities and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to
        services to and sales of the Funds or other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock
        and the Entities and their sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also
        benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock or the Entities and such
        personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service
        providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered
        representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to
        BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation
        assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or
        investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally
        communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to
        a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in
        the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable,
        a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund
        might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to
        receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at
        the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an
        asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair
        values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued by BlackRock (pursuant

        diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for which it receives an asset-based fee.</div>
<div>To the extent permitted by
        applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a
        Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional
        expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors,
        officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading
        and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the
        possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities
        trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting
        BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a
        duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div>
<div>BlackRock will not purchase
        securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are
        affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in
        circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security
        or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with,
        limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or
        recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock or an Entity is performing investment
        banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from
        or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of
        which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information
        barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Entity, or are the subject of an advisory or
        risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of
        BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by
        companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other
        derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
        license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>If certain aggregate ownership
        thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of
        investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases,
        sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its
        sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>

<div>
<div>In those circumstances where
        ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and
        investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities
        nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases
        in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable
        to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold
        prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other
        ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with
        respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an
        Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div>
<div>BlackRock may maintain securities
        indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices
        also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name.
        BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to any Fund and the Funds are under
        no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms
        offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described
        in “Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating
        expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees
        when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that
        BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be
        beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or
        reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into
        contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall relationship with
        such service providers. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions may accrue, in whole or in part,
        to BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership
        interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision
        of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates
        BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an
        arrangement with Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) to be one of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry
        platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development partner, BlackRock has licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. Once the ICE Platform is
        launched, BlackRock intends to use the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad
        adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s intellectual property to ICE and for
        BlackRock’s</div>

<div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees
        from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>A Fund from time to time may
        purchase in the secondary market (i) certain mortgage pass-through securities packaged and master serviced by PNC Mortgage Securities Corp. (“PNC Mortgage”) or Midland Loan Services, Inc.
        (“Midland”), or (ii) mortgage-related securities containing loans or mortgages originated by PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) or its affiliates. It is possible that under some
        circumstances, PNC Mortgage, Midland or other affiliates could have interests that are in conflict with the holders of these mortgage-backed securities, and such holders could have rights against PNC Mortgage, Midland
        or their affiliates. For example, if PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates engaged in negligence or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties as a master servicer, then any holder of the mortgage-backed
        security could seek recourse against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable. Also, as a master servicer, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may make certain representations and warranties
        regarding the quality of the mortgages and properties underlying a mortgage-backed security. If one or more of those representations or warranties is false, then the holders of the mortgage backed securities could
        trigger an obligation of PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable, to repurchase the mortgages from the issuing trust. Finally, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may own securities that are
        subordinate to the senior mortgage-backed securities owned by a Fund.</div>
<div>Present and future activities of
        BlackRock (including BFA) and the Entities and their respective directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</div>
<div>Legal Proceedings.<font>  On June 16, 2016, investors (the “Plaintiffs”) in certain iShares funds (iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P 500
        ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares Select Dividend ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF, iShares
        Preferred and Income Securities ETF and iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF) filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Trust, BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its advisory affiliates, and certain
        directors/trustees and officers of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”) in California State Court. The lawsuit alleges the Defendants violated federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose in
        the prospectuses issued by the funds noted above the risks of using stop-loss orders in the event of a “flash crash,” such as the one that occurred on May 6, 2010. On September 18, 2017, the court issued a
        Statement of Decision holding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims. On October 11, 2017, the court entered final judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice. In an opinion
        dated January 23, 2020, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims. On March 3, 2020, plaintiffs filed a petition for review by the California Supreme Court.</font></div>

<div>Investment Adviser. <font> BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation
        indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the
        Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and

<div>Each of the portfolios or accounts
        for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management seeks to track the rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics of independent third-party indexes by either
        replicating the same combination of securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that compose those
        indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to BFA policy, investment opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an
        investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal constraints or other factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and
        accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time the Funds may receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than it would have if the Portfolio
        Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other
        portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory
        services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or
        account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio's or account's gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA
        or its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment
        opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and its affiliates have an obligation to allocate
        resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intends to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and accounts managed by an investment adviser
        and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict-of-interest, which may result in the Portfolio Managers' favoring those
        portfolios or accounts with performance-based fee arrangements.</div>
<div>The tables below show, for each
        Portfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or accounts of the types set forth in the above tables and the aggregate of total assets in those portfolios or accounts with respect to which the investment management fees
        are based on the performance of those portfolios or accounts as of October 31, 2019:</div>

<div>components and may vary from year to year based on
        a number of factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation
        programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div>
<div>Each portfolio manager receives
        base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive compensation,
        determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio
        manager and the team relative to its investment objective (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the
        overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In
        some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term shareholders and motivate
        performance.</div>
<div>The discretionary incentive income
        for James Mauro and Scott Radell includes as an additional consideration the performance of actively-managed portfolios they manage over 1, 3 and 5 year periods measured against the respective benchmark of each
        portfolio as well as peer group performance. A portion of the discretionary incentive compensation for James Mauro and Scott Radell is distributed in the form of deferred cash awards that notionally track the returns
        of select BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which provides direct alignment of portfolio manager discretionary incentive compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards vest ratably
        over a number of years and, once vested, settle in the form of cash.</div>
<div>As of October 31, 2019, the
        Portfolio Managers did not beneficially own shares of the Funds.</div>
<div>Codes of Ethics. <font> The Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to
        invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover
        of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at
        publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div>
<div>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements.
        <font> The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money
        laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities. Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the
        true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information will be used to verify the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for
        compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font></div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to
        reject purchase orders from persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow a Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose identity
        it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the Funds' policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit
        activities.</div>
<div>Administrator, Custodian and Transfer
        Agent.<font>   State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) serves as administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Funds under the Master Services Agreement and related
        Service Schedule (the “Service Module”). State Street’s principal address is 1 Lincoln Street, Boston, MA 02111. Pursuant to the Service Module for Fund Administration and Accounting Services with
        the Trust, State Street provides necessary administrative, legal, tax and accounting and financial reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each Fund. In addition, State Street makes
        available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to provide such services. Pursuant to the Service Module for Custodial Services with the Trust, State Street maintains, in separate accounts,
        cash, securities and other assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and records and provides other services. State Street is required, upon the order of the Trust, to deliver securities held by
        State Street and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. State Street is authorized to appoint certain foreign custodians or foreign custody managers for Fund investments outside the U.S.

<div>Distributor. <font> The Distributor's principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Shares are continuously offered for sale by the Funds through the Distributor or its agent only
        in Creation Units, as described in the applicable Prospectus and below in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units </font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the
        delivery of the applicable Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by
        it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
        (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each
        Fund provides that it may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees,
        or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined
        in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into
        agreements with securities dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC
        participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from
        time to time and from its own resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the
        Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the
        securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the
        reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational
        costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the
        “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual
        rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>

<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending
        Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i)
        fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retained 80% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income
        plus collateral investment fees. Effective January 1, 2019, (i) fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never
        be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Under the securities lending
        program, the Funds are categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of
        which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the
        business day following the date that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under
        “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable fixed-income fund, pursuant to the securities lending agreement, will receive for the
        remainder of that calendar year securities lending income as follows:</div>
<div>(i) 85% of securities lending
        income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds
        by BTC in the most recent fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting
        borrowers from an approved list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating
        the terms of securities loans, including the amount of fees; </div>
<div>(3) directing
        the delivery of loaned securities; </div>
<div>(4) monitoring
        the daily value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of excess collateral, as necessary; </div>
<div>(5) investing
        cash collateral received in connection with any loaned securities; </div>
<div>(6) monitoring
        distributions on loaned securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </div>
<div>(7) in the event
        of default by a borrower with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that
        of the loaned securities; and </div>
<div>(8) terminating
        securities loans and arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan termination.</div>
<div>Each Fund had no income and
        fees/compensation related to its securities lending activities during its most recent fiscal year.</div>
<div>Payments by BFA and its
        Affiliates.<font>  BFA and/or its affiliates (“BFA Entities”) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries
        (“Intermediaries”) for certain activities related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of
        the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price
        paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that
        are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities,
        such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities
        also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing Costs”). In
        addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to</font></div>

<div>their clients, develop new products that feature
        iShares or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in
        consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type
        described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</div>
<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be
        significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an
        Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to
        receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded
        products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her
        Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments
        described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to
        Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds,
        exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities
        have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this
        relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”),
        FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in
        advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket
        charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain
        brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing
        Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter
        into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may
        include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made
        pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain
        minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Charles Schwab &amp; Co.,

<div>The Funds may participate in
        certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the
        securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and
        market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a
        Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset
        Value</div>
<div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of securities held
        by a Fund is as follows:</font></div>
<div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each, an “Exchange”) are
        valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price on the Exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last
        traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an
        equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held
        by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures approved by the Board (the “Valuation Procedures”),
        BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments. <font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio
        securities using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each
        in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration
        of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally
        value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than
        institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method
        does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from independent third-party pricing services.
        Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the entity, establish a
        benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other
        Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on
        which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask
        (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless
        BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives
        are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices)</font></div>

<div>supplied by a Fund’s approved independent
        third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures
        contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations
        from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information. <font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in
        thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the
        value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by
        technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>All cash, receivables and current
        payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</div>
<div>Prices obtained from independent
        third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and
        liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally
        will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</div>
<div>In the event that application of
        the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or
        in accordance with a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including
        restricted securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a
        foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers.</div>
<div>Certain of the securities acquired
        by a Fund may be traded on foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized
        Participants can neither purchase nor redeem shares of a Fund.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S.
        securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
        securities used in computing the NAV of a Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>Use of fair value prices and
        certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between
        a Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Fair Value.<font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value
        Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BlackRock in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among
        other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source
        is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or
        where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event”
        is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s
        assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of the assets or liabilities held by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that
        occurs in the markets or in related or highly correlated assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or ETFs that invest in components of the Underlying Index) on a trading day</font></div>

<div>
<div>after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may
        be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s
        price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or
        liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock, with input from the
        BlackRock Investment Strategy Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation
        Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers
        and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently
        reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a
        Fair Value Asset, the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability
        in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of
        extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or
        BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith
        approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset
        type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management
        pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or
        related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the
        fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the
        particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the
        effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited
        financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in
        Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring
        fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they
        invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become more
        stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity
        due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by
        the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks
        to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities
        of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission
        available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select
        a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In</div>

<div>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
        pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to
        execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security
        or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available;
        (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the
        broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and
        (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved
        in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act
        (“Section 28(e)”) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the
        amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on
        riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may
        purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA
        has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that
        available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div>
<div>OTC issues, including most
        fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as
        brokers. The Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect
        to both foreign and domestic securities will generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time,
        and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons
        affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such
        transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and
        affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which
        BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market
        instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally
        traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect
        trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any
        commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in
        underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an
        issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>

<div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds
        and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment
        allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account;
        (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for
        accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover,
        investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one
        client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or
        benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates
        may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>Initial public offerings
        (“IPOs”) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or
        “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and
        equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with
        respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have
        indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international equity securities, the country where
        the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to
        share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such
        investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
        equitable to clients may be used as well.</div>
<div>Because different accounts may have
        differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts.
        For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one
        client of BFA or the other Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a
        security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of
        securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be
        made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find
        it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In
        general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each
        client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled at several different prices through multiple
        trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice could have
        a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of
        more than one of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched
        order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified</div>

<div>as being able to provide the best execution of the
        order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the order.</div>
<div>There were no brokerage commissions
        paid on behalf of each Fund for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019, October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017.</div>
<div>None of the Funds paid any
        brokerage commissions to BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, or to any other broker-dealer that is part of the BlackRock group of companies, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.</div>
<div>The Funds' purchase and sale orders
        for securities may be combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts
        managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some
        cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume
        transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,
        from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these
        provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds will not deal with
        affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from
        year to year, as well as within a year. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses.</div>
<div>The tables below set forth the
        portfolio turnover rates of each Fund for the fiscal years noted:</div>

<div>Additional Information Concerning
        the Trust</div>
<div>Shares.<font>  The Trust currently consists of more than 290 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value.
        The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font></div>
<div>Each share issued by a fund has a
        <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate
        equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with
        respect to matters upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote
        together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>

<div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is
        not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act.
        All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the
        initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule
        0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by
        writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or
        other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated
        thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be
        subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their
        own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC staff.</div>
<div>In accordance with the Trust's
        current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable
        law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or
        a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances
        described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides
        that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to
        permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of
        cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for shareholders owning in
        excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>Each Fund will wind up and
        terminate on or about December 1 of the relevant year. Upon each Fund's termination, it will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to
        then-current shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In accordance with the Declaration of Trust, each Fund will terminate on or about the date above as approved by a majority of the Board without requiring
        additional shareholder approval. The Board may extend the termination date if a majority of the Board determines the extension to be in the best interest of the Fund.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for
        Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable
        electronic movement of securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central
        counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
        DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of
        directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or
        indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is
        limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are
        referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC
        Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC</div>

<div>Participant a written confirmation relating to
        their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain
        investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices,
        statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a
        fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or
        indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant
        may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each
        such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</div>
<div>Share distributions shall be made
        to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with
        payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial
        Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered
        in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</div>
<div>The Trust has no responsibility or
        liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
        records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants
        and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging
        its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares. <font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors
        participating in the seeding may be Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all
        of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from
        time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div>
<div>Selling Shareholders may sell
        shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems,
        in the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated
        prices. These sales may be effected through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable
        law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any
        broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any
        other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</div>

<div>In its discretion, the Trust
        reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of
        any Fund, and to make a corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the
        range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with
        respect to each Fund is any day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as
        observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>
<div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally consists of the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit
        Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio securities is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile
        similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is
        an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to
        compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit
        Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</div>
<div>The Deposit Securities and Fund
        Securities, as applicable, in connection with a purchase or redemption of a Creation Unit of a Fund, generally will correspond <font>pro rata</font> to the securities held by such Fund. As the planned termination date of each Fund approaches, and particularly as the bonds held by the Fund begin to mature, the Fund expects
        to effect both creations and redemptions increasingly for cash. Consistent with the exemptive orders granted to the Funds by the SEC, creation baskets will correspond generally to the price and yield performance of
        the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the
        NSCC on each Business Day prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number or par value of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included
        in the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation
        Units of shares of the Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</div>

<div>The identity and number or par
        value of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the
        investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying
        Index.</div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to
        permit or require the substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not
        be eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or
        require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities
        or other local laws or in certain other situations.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method. <font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or
        specified for a Fund, they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the
        Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation
        Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”), a clearing agency that is
        registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant
        Agreement”) (discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds,
        however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized
        Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor. Such Authorized Participant will
        agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make
        available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the net asset value of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper
        form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect
        to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their
        particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an
        Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant
        Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized
        Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the
        Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under
        its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div>
<div>Placement of Creation Orders.<font>  Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a
        central depository account, such as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a “Central Depository Account”). Any portion of a Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through
        the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central Depository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the
        delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve
        System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Federal Reserve System to the
        account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account</font></div>

<div>
<div>must be completed pursuant to the requirements
        established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The “Settlement Date” for all funds is generally the
        second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered
        securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank
        wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00
        p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly
        constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed
        received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the applicable Fund prior to such time.</div>
<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper
        form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide
        such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time
        to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of
        current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the
        Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must
        also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next
        determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations
        department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that
        an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div>
<div>The Authorized Participant is
        responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase
        Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV.
        Creation Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or
        market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the
        submission of purchase orders is referred to as the Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an
        Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained
        for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with each Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in
        the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation
        Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii)
        arrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the
        Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth below.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Once a Fund has accepted an order,
        upon the next determination of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then
        transmit a confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div>
<div>Each Fund reserves the absolute
        right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of
        the currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would
        have certain adverse tax consequences to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA,
        have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii) circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The
        Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the
        sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure
        to give such notification.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>   Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash
        Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant
        sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally
        issued on a “T+2 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or
        appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an
        Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part
        or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and
        maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with
        the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy Deposit Securities for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash
        collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the
        Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit
        Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to
        liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div>
<div>In certain cases, Authorized
        Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized
        Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility
        and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation
        Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction
        fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the
        applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,
        execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs).
        Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use
        the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>Redemption of Creation Units. <font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the
        Distributor or its agent and only on a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary
        market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that
        could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund generally redeems
        Creation Units for Fund Securities (as defined below). Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the
        NSCC, prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange on each Business Day, the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be
        applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash
        Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the corresponding Cash Amount (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund
        until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to
        creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are
        available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the
        shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole
        discretion, substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including
        circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized
        Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash
        paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash
        payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the
        right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition
        of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV.</div>

<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>   Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available
        or specified for a Fund, they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of
        the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font></div>
<div>Costs Associated with Redemption
        Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is
        charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the applicable
        Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution,
        price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized
        Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances.
        Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>Placement of Redemption Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of a Fund must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an
        irrevocable request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may
        require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized
        Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must
        transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that
        their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant
        who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware
        that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an
        Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to a Fund's transfer agent; such investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other
        financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered
        to be in “proper form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be
        effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a</div>

<div>
<div>request in form satisfactory to the applicable
        Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in
        the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption
        request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities
        and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry
        system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant,
        whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any
        of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds
        by each Fund are generally made within two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). Each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 but by T+7, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and
        compliant with applicable law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort
        to link distribution to distribution record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption settlement process may be extended beyond T+2 because of the occurrence of a holiday in a
        non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</div>
<div>If neither the redeeming Beneficial
        Owner nor the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible
        to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming
        Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund
        next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund’s brokerage and other transaction costs
        associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it
        otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first
        registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not
        ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units, in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as
        practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter).</div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an
        Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit
        to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to 10:00 a.m., Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption
        request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of
        collateral consisting of cash, in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds, having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of
        the missing shares. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the day after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State
        Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the Authorized Participant. The cash
        collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. The Authorized
        Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Fund of purchasing
        such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>

<div>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions
        of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the
        market value of the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any
        loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax
        laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year,
        or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div>

<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of
        certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences
        that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to
        the specific federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all
        of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company
        Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually
        distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the
        following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities
        or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net
        income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of its income from interest,
        dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets
        must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer
        to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total
        assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or
        related trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a
        failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any
        taxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by
        that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although in general the passive
        loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in
        partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>

<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided
        that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable
        income” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for
        the taxable year. A Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a
        RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions
        generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be
        treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net
        investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify
        as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the Fund may
        be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it
        qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards.
        <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</font></div>
<div>In the event that a Fund were to
        experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div>

<div>Excise Tax. <font> A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for
        the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that
        is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased
        to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to
        avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made.
        However, any dividend or capital gain distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to
        have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the
        following calendar year.</font></div>

<div>Each Fund intends to distribute
        annually to its shareholders substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses
        (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any
        capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to
        its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit
        their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities,
        if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b).
        Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund with the IRS.</div>
<div>Distributions of net realized
        long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the
        Fund. All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary
        income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular
        dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in
        respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose
        is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or
        (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a
        Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital
        gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits,
        will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax
        purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to
        such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest
        dividends received.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare
        contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and
        filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares
        just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may
        nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross
        income not as of the date received but as of the later of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e</font>., the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired such security. Accordingly,
        in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the
        case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may,
        for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss
        (defined as the sum of the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December
        ordinary losses over post-December ordinary</div>

<div>income) until the next taxable year in computing
        its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may
        affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</div>
<div>Sales of Shares.<font>  Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s
        basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the
        shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on
        a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option, or contract to
        acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to
        reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital
        loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale
        of Fund shares.</font></div>
<div>If a shareholder incurs a sales
        charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales
        charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
        reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares
        made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has
        failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv)
        has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal
        income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362. <font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so
        ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of
        such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more
        taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust
        determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share
        ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund that are properly reported as exempt-interest dividends will not be subject to regular federal income tax. Dividends paid on Fund shares that are loaned out
        pursuant to securities lending arrangements will not be exempt from income tax. Each Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from
        U.S. federal income taxation, including the federal AMT. In the last year of operation, when a Fund’s target date is reached, the Fund may invest in AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, including tax
        anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, tax and revenue anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes and bond anticipation notes; municipal commercial paper; tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes
        and obligations. The 3.8% Medicare contribution tax (discussed above) will not apply to exempt interest dividends paid by a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividends paid by a Fund reported
        as exempt-interest dividends will be exempt from federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the extent of the Fund’s net tax-exempt income as long as 50% or more of the
        value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal or other bonds that are excluded</div>

<div>from gross income for U.S. federal income tax
        purposes as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends. Exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund allocable to interest income from the municipal bonds of a particular state may be
        exempt from income taxation for shareholders who are residents of such state. Exempt-interest dividends from interest from municipal bonds of other states generally are not so exempt. However, the receipt of
        exempt-interest dividends may require a shareholder to recharacterize a portion of certain non-taxable social security and railroad retirement benefit payments as taxable income. Shareholders should consult their own
        tax advisors. A Fund may engage in derivative transactions with respect to obligations producing tax-exempt interest that may cause the Fund to not be treated as the owner of such obligations for purposes of the 50%
        threshold described above.</div>
<div>Taxation of Certain
        Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S.
        currencies), to the extent permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among
        other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount
        and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay dividends or make distributions in
        amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries
        in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent
        disqualification of the Fund as a RIC.</font></div>
<div>A Fund’s investments in
        so-called “section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special
        tax rules. All section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the
        Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a Fund from positions in
        section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets and were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the
        resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were
        actually held by a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap
        contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction.
        Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has
        been a party to the swap for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a swap transaction will be netted <font>pro rata</font> against both tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future
        payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss. Periodic net payments that would otherwise constitute ordinary
        deductions but are allocable under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends will not be allowed as deductions but instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Market Discount. <font> Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or
        adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount (“OID”). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s disposition of such an
        obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Investments.<font>  Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time the Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or
        other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time the Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and
        losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are
        denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain</font></div>

<div>
<div>non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts and
        the disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or
        loss unless the Fund were to elect otherwise.</div>
<div>Original Issue Discount. <font> OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder of the bond. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds.
        Generally, all stated interest on such bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in
        the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as original issue discount. The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the
        general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond
        matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The amount of negative inflation adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted
        principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable
        year.</font></div>
<div>Reporting.<font>  If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the
        shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance,
        shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders
        should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders.
        <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent
        derived from investment income and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a
        reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to
        regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
        U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may
        also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable
        form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are
        generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than
        certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are
        paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable
        year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat
        such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification
        requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may
        withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
        rules to their accounts.</div>
<div>Distributions to certain foreign
        shareholders by a Fund at least 50% of the assets of which are “U.S. real property interests” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations) at any time during the five-year period
        ending on the date of the distributions, to the extent the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding
        corporations” such as certain REITs, although exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of
        such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distributions), generally must be treated by such foreign shareholders as income effectively connected to a trade or business

<div>which is generally subject to tax at the graduated
        rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, except for distributions to foreign shareholders that held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the previous one-year period ending on the date of
        the distributions. Such distributions may be subject to U.S. withholding tax and may require a foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, sales or redemptions of shares held by certain
        foreign shareholders in such a Fund generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax and generally will require the foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return, although exceptions may apply if more
        than 50% of the value of the Fund’s shares are held by U.S. shareholders or the foreign shareholder selling or redeeming the shares has held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during
        the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or redemption.</div>
<div>Provided that more than 50% of the
        value of a Fund’s stock is held by U.S. shareholders, redemptions and other distributions made in the form of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding
        corporations”, although exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at
        any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution) generally will cause the Fund to recognize a portion of any unrecognized gain in the U.S. real property interests equal to the product of
        (i) the excess of fair market value of such U.S. real property interests over the Fund’s adjusted bases in such interests and (ii) the greatest foreign ownership percentage of the Fund during the five-year
        period ending on the date of distribution.</div>
<div>Shareholders that are nonresident
        aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax
        is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS
        information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid
        withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers
        of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained;
        agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their
        account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
        entities will need to provide the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S.
        shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S. estate tax.</div>
<div>The foregoing discussion is a
        summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
        consequences of investing in such shares, including consequences under state, local and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is based on applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, regulations,

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock’s purpose is to
        help more and more people experience financial well-being. As a fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on
        behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official
        institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world.</div>
<div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE
        GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock Investment Stewardship
        (“BIS”) activities are focused on maximizing long-term value for our clients. BIS does this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us
        authority, through voting at shareholder meetings.</div>
<div>We believe that there are certain
        fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best
        interests. Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment
        of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes to the
        purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and
        timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the
        performance of the board of directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and
        managed. The board should provide direction and leadership to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on
        shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal
        that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case
        basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our
        approach to engaging with companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary
        internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate
        governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific assessments.</div>
<div>We believe BlackRock has a
        responsibility in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on
        corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the best long -term economic interests of our clients, and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long -term
        shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s
        oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a <font>team profile on our website</font>.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT
        AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted
        standards of corporate governance differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship
        activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of
        long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific
        resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div>

</div>
<div>At a minimum, we expect companies
        to observe the accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach
        taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform
        independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long -term economic
        interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external research.</div>
<div>BlackRock views engagement as an
        important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of the challenges and opportunities that investee companies are facing and their governance structures. Engagement also
        allows us to share our philosophy and approach to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company
        disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the
        market.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s engagements
        emphasize direct dialogue with corporate leadership on the governance issues identified in these principles that have a material impact on financial performance. These engagements enable us to cast informed votes
        aligned with clients’ long-term economic interests. We generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a long-term investor,
        we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits
        of a company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We
        do not try to micro-manage companies, or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue
        will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is
        critical to the economic success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company.
        For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to

<div>BlackRock believes that directors

        protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</div>

</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the
        operation of the board is enhanced when there is a clearly independent, senior non -executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead
        director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging
        independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s
        approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains
        effective, regular reviews of board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto
        the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple
        dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The
        board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we
        would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the
        board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of
        fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to
        decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a significant adverse event.</div>
<div>Auditors and audit-related issues</div>
<div>Comprehensive disclosure provides
        investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably
        conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical
        importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the
        management of the audit function. We take particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial
        statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit
        firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the
        auditor.</div>

<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset
        sales and other special transactions</div>
<div>The capital structure of a company
        is critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a
        key protection for shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</div>
<div>Effective voting rights are central
        to the rights of ownership and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in
        protecting company value, and voting power should match economic exposure.</div>
<div>We are concerned that the creation
        of a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share,
        one vote principle is designed to mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such
        companies should review these dual-class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a
        management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures
        at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales
        or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long -term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale
        behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it enhances long -term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have
        been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to
        place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to
        be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that
        shareholders have a right to dispose of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are
        contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own
        best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s
        board of directors to put in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder
        returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that
        their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate
        existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there
        should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge
        that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking
        rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on
        long -term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual
        performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and
        other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div>

<div>Non-executive directors should be
        compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their
        independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to
        protect and enhance their economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well -managed companies
        will deal effectively with the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses.</div>
<div>Robust disclosure is essential for
        investors to effectively gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;S risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to
        issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB
        and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations
        provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality
        map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking
        undertaken, and verification processes in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with
        companies for several years on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically
        ask companies to:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>1)
                    </td>
<td>publish a disclosure in line with industry-specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2)
                    </td>
<td>disclose climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a
                    scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines.
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>See our <font>commentary</font> on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and
        our engagements to ascertain whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including
        BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>We believe that when a company is
        not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the
        election of directors where we have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such
        concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S
        factors.</div>
<div>In deciding our course of action,
        we will assess the company’s disclosures and the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>

                    </td>

                    </td>

                    </td>

                    </td>
</tr>

</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to
        make social or political judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee
        companies to comply,</div>

<div>at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the
        jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where local laws or regulations that significantly impact the company’s operations are contradictory or ambiguous to global
        norms.</div>
<div>Climate risk</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out
        above, as well as our guidance on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long -
        term financial sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate -related risks
        and opportunities.</div>
<div>We expect companies to help their
        investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around
        this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how
        climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk.</div>
<div>Where a company receives a
        shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of
        its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree
        that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters
        and shareholder protections</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that
        shareholders have a right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance
        structures in place and the rights of shareholders to influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality
        of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the
        shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS
        INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES</div>
<div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high
        standard in our investment stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who
        do not have other responsibilities other than their roles in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional
        advisory committees (“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock
        investment professionals and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within
        each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div>
<div>In addition to the regional
        Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock
        investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary
        oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global
        Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global</div>

<div>
<div>Committee also reviews and approves amendments to
        the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee
        receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews
        these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with
        companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate
        governance issues and participates in industry discussions to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and
        performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate
        regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies
        submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have
        voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the
        proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management
        policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights,
        BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market
        practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that
        the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long - term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of
        there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the
        particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting
        involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of
        shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share- blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise
        their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints;
        and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or
        overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes
        proxies on a “best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to
        opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div>
<div>Portfolio managers have full
        discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item. Portfolio managers may from time to time reach differing views on how best to maximize
        economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from one another. However, because
        BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform manner.</div>

                    with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies, and BlackRock’s proxy voting agent votes the proxy in accordance with the independent fiduciary’s determination. BlackRock uses an independent fiduciary

                    reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived

<div>When so authorized, BlackRock acts
        as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is driven by our clients’ economic interests. The
        decision whether to recall securities on loan to vote is based on a formal analysis of the revenue producing value to clients of loans, against the assessed economic value of casting votes. Generally, we expect that
        the likely economic value to clients of casting votes would be less than the securities lending income, either because, in our assessment, the resolutions being voted on will not have significant economic consequences
        or because the outcome would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to vote. BlackRock also may, in our discretion, determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares,
        and thus recall shares to vote in that instance.</div>
<div>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our
        process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may modify it as necessary.</div>

<div>
<div>These guidelines should be read in
        conjunction with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship <font>Global Corporate Governance Guidelines &amp; Engagement Principles.</font></div>
<div>INTRODUCTION</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc. and its
        subsidiaries (collectively, “BlackRock”) seek to make proxy voting decisions in the manner most likely to protect and enhance the economic value of the securities held in client accounts. The following
        issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the “Guidelines”) are intended to summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s general philosophy and approach to corporate governance issues that most
        commonly arise in proxy voting for U.S. securities. These Guidelines are not intended to limit the analysis of individual issues at specific companies and are not intended to provide a guide to how BlackRock will vote
        in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots , as well as our
        expectations of boards of directors. They are applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company and the individual ballot item.</div>
<div>VOTING GUIDELINES</div>
<div>These guidelines are divided into
        eight key themes which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of annual and extraordinary meetings of shareholders:</div>
<div>

<div>BOARDS AND DIRECTORS</div>
<div>Director elections</div>
<div>In general, BlackRock supports the
        election of directors as recommended by the board in uncontested elections. However, we believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held account able. We may
        withhold votes from directors or members of particular board committees in certain situations, as indicated below .</div>
<div>Independence</div>
<div>We expect a majority of the
        directors on the board to be independent. In addition, all members of key committees, including audit, compensation, and nominating / governance committees, should be independent. Our view of independence may vary
        slightly from listing standards.</div>
<div>In particular, common impediments
        to independence in the U.S. may include:</div>
<div>
<table>

                    </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>•

                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Having any other interest, business, or relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to
                    act in the best interests of the company
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>We may vote against directors
        serving on key committees that we do not consider to be independent.</div>
<div>When evaluating controlled
        companies, as defined by the U.S. stock exchanges, we will only vote against insiders or affiliates who sit on the audit committee, but not other key committees.</div>

<div>Oversight</div>
<div>We expect the board to exercise
        appropriate oversight over management and business activities of the company. We will consider voting against committee members and / or individual directors in the following circumstances:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Where the board has failed to exercise oversight with regard to accounting practices or audit oversight, we will consider voting against the current audit committee, and any other
                    members of the board who may be responsible. For example, this may apply to members of the audit committee during a period when the board failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing if substantial accounting
                    irregularities suggest insufficient oversight by that committee
                    </td>

                    a majority of independent directors. However, this would not apply in the case of a controlled company

<div>Board composition and
        effectiveness</div>
<div>We encourage boards to periodically
        renew their membership to ensure relevant skills and experience within the boardroom. To this end, regular performance reviews and skills assessments should be conducted by the nominating / governance committee.</div>
<div>Furthermore, we expect boards to be
        comprised of a diverse selection of individuals who bring their personal and professional experiences to bear in order to create a constructive debate of competing views and opinions in the boardroom. We recognize
        that diversity has multiple dimensions. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the full breadth of diversity including personal factors, such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
        as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. In addition to other elements of diversity, we encourage companies to have at least two women directors
        on their board. Our publicly available <font>commentary</font> explains our approach to engaging on board diversity.</div>
<div>We encourage boards to disclose
        their views on:</div>

</div>
<div>While we support regular board
        refreshment, we are not opposed in principle to long-tenured directors, nor do we believe that long board tenure is necessarily an impediment to director independence. A variety of director tenures within the
        boardroom can be beneficial to ensure board quality and continuity of experience.</div>
<div>Our primary concern is that board
        members are able to contribute effectively as corporate strategy evolves and business conditions change, and that all directors, regardless of tenure, demonstrate appropriate responsiveness to shareholders. We
        acknowledge that no single person can be expected to bring all relevant skill sets to a board; at the same time, we generally do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to have any particular director on the board
        solely by virtue of a singular background or specific area of expertise.</div>
<div>Where boards find that age limits
        or term limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits.</div>
<div>To the extent that we believe that
        a company has not adequately accounted for diversity in its board composition within a reasonable timeframe, we may vote against the nominating / governance committee for an apparent lack of commitment to board
        effectiveness.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Board size</div>
<div>We typically defer to the board in
        setting the appropriate size and believe directors are generally in the best position to assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may oppose boards that appear too small to allow for
        effective shareholder representation or too large to function efficiently.</div>
<div>CEO and management succession
        planning</div>
<div>There should be a robust CEO and
        senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. We expect succession planning to cover both long-term planning consistent with the strategic direction of
        the company and identified leadership needs over time, as well as short-term planning in the event of an unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain its executive succession planning
        process, including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information commonly associated with this exercise.</div>
<div>Classified board of directors /
        staggered terms</div>
<div>We believe that directors should be
        re-elected annually and that classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals
        requesting board de-classification, we may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure, such as when a company needs consistency and stability
        during a time of transition, e.g. newly public companies or companies undergoing a strategic restructuring. A classified board structure may also be justified at non-operating companies in certain circumstances. We
        would, however, expect boards with a classified structure to periodically review the rationale for such structure and consider when annual elections might be appropriate.</div>
<div>Without a voting mechanism to
        immediately address concerns of a specific director, we may choose to vote against or withhold votes from the available slate of directors by default (see “Shareholder rights” for additional detail).</div>
<div>Contested director elections</div>
<div>The details of contested elections,
        or proxy contests, are assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, which may include: the qualifications of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the concerns identified by
        the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the likelihood that the dissident’s solutions will produce the desired change; and whether the dissident represents the
        best option for enhancing long -term shareholder value.</div>
<div>Cumulative voting</div>
<div>We believe that a majority vote
        standard is in the best long -term interest of shareholders. It ensures director accountability via the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose proposals
        requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or director candidates.</div>
<div>Director compensation and equity
        programs</div>
<div>We believe that compensation for
        directors should be structured to attract and retain the best possible directors, while also aligning their interests with those of shareholders. We believe director compensation packages that are based on the
        company’s long-term value creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal. In addition, we expect directors to build meaningful share ownership over time.</div>
<div>Majority vote requirements</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors
        should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted and will normally support proposals seeking to introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority voting standards assist
        in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. Some companies with a plurality voting standard have adopted a resignation policy for
        directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where we believe that the company already has a sufficiently robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder
        proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</div>

<div>Risk oversight</div>
<div>Companies should have an
        established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing key risks. Independent directors should have ready access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure they can
        properly oversee risk management. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk measurement, mitigation, and reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight
        processes evolve in response to changes in corporate strategy and / or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long -term
        operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>Separation of chairman and CEO</div>
<div>We believe that independent
        leadership is important in the boardroom. In the U.S. there are two commonly accepted structures for independent board leadership: 1) an independent chairman; or 2) a lead independent director when the roles of
        chairman and CEO are combined.</div>
<div>In the absence of a significant
        governance concern, we defer to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</div>
<div>In the event that the board chooses
        a combined chair / CEO model, we generally support the designation of a lead independent director if they have the power to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of the independent
        directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent directors. Furthermore, while we anticipate that most directors will be elected annually, we believe an element of continuity is important for this role for an
        extended period of time to provide appropriate leadership balance to the chair / CEO.</div>
<div>The following table illustrates
        examples of responsibilities under each board leadership model:</div>

<div>AUDITORS AND AUDIT-RELATED
        ISSUES</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical
        importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on boards of directors, we seek to hold the audit
        committee of the board responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function at a company, and may withhold votes from the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality,
        independent auditing. We look to</div>

        involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we expect timely disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial
        statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that
        eventually lead to a significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice that protect the interests of shareholders, we may also vote against ratification.</div>
<div>From time to time, shareholder
        proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</div>
<div>CAPITAL STRUCTURE PROPOSALS</div>
<div>Equal voting rights</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that
        shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. We believe that companies that look to add or already have dual or multiple class share structures should review these
        structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Companies should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy.
        The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to
        shareholders. Equal voting rights</div>

<div>Blank check preferred stock</div>
<div>We frequently oppose proposals
        requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other rights (“blank check” preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of
        authority from shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as
        it affords the board the ability to place a block of stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</div>
<div>Nonetheless, we may support the
        proposal where the company:</div>
<div>

<tr>
<td>•

</div>
<div>Increase in authorized common
        shares</div>
<div>BlackRock considers
        industry-specific norms in our analysis of these proposals, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares. Generally, we are predisposed to support a company if the board believes
        additional common shares are necessary to carry out the firm’s business. The most substantial concern we might have with an increase is the possibility of use of common shares to fund a poison pill plan that is
        not in the economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Increase or issuance of preferred
        stock</div>
<div>We generally support proposals to
        increase or issue preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</div>

<div>Stock splits</div>
<div>We generally support stock splits
        that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the
        stock, where the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g<font>.</font> one class is reduced while others remain at pre- split levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not also proportionately reduce the company’s
        authorized stock, we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</div>
<div>MERGERS, ASSET SALES, AND OTHER
        SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS</div>
<div>BlackRock’s primary concern
        is the best long-term economic interests of shareholders. While merger, asset sales, and other special transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our
        analyses, such as:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the
                    merger announcement. In most cases, business combinations should provide a premium. We may consider comparable transaction analyses provided by the parties’ financial advisors and our own valuation assessments.
                    For companies facing insolvency or bankruptcy, a premium may not apply
                    </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Unanimous board approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider whether the transaction involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of
                    an arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider whether executive and / or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders’
                    interests before their own
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>We prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial advisor assessing the value of the transaction to shareholders in
                    comparison to recent similar transactions
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>Poison pill plans</div>
<div>Where a poison pill is put to a
        shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although we oppose most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable “qualifying offer clause.” Such clauses
        typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is renewed.</div>
<div>These clauses also tend to specify
        that an all cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote, or the
        board to seek the written consent of shareholders where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic
        benefits that may be associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders.</div>
<div>We generally vote in favor of
        shareholder proposals to rescind poison pills.</div>
<div>Reimbursement of expenses for
        successful shareholder campaigns</div>
<div>We generally do not support
        shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations where we support the shareholder campaign. We believe that introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may
        incentivize disruptive and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</div>
<div>EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</div>
<div>We note that there are both
        management and shareholder proposals related to executive compensation. We generally vote on these proposals as described below, except that we typically oppose shareholder proposals on issues where the company
        already has a reasonable policy in place that we believe is sufficient to address the issue. We may also oppose a shareholder proposal regarding executive compensation if the company’s history suggests that the
        issue raised is not likely to present a problem for that company.</div>

<div>Advisory resolutions on executive
        compensation (“Say on Pay”)</div>
<div>In cases where there is a Say on
        Pay vote, BlackRock will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to
        shareholders. In a commentary on our website, entitled “<font>BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to executive compensation</font>,” we explain our beliefs and expectations related to executive compensation practices, our
        Say on Pay analysis framework, and our typical approach to engagement and voting on Say on Pay.</div>
<div>Advisory votes on the frequency of
        Say on Pay resolutions</div>
<div>BlackRock will generally support
        triennial pay frequency votes, but we defer to the board to determine the appropriate timeframe upon which pay should be reviewed. In evaluating pay, we believe that the compensation committee is responsible for
        constructing a plan that appropriately incentivizes executives for long-term value creation, utilizing relevant metrics and structure to ensure overall pay and performance alignment. In a similar vein, we defer to the
        board to establish the most appropriate timeframe for review of pay structure, absent a change in strategy that would suggest otherwise.</div>
<div>However, we may support an annual
        pay frequency vote in some situations, for example, where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance. In these circumstances, we will also consider voting against the compensation committee
        members.</div>

<div>We generally favor recoupment from
        any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial reporting or deceptive business practices. In addition to fraudulent acts, we also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior caused
        direct financial harm to shareholders, reputational risk to the company , or resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This
        includes, but is not limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically support shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a
        robust claw back policy that sufficiently addresses our concerns.</div>
<div>Employee stock purchase plans</div>
<div>We believe these plans can provide
        performance incentives and help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common form of employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) qualifies for favorable tax treatment under
        Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically support qualified ESPP proposals.</div>
<div>Equity compensation plans</div>
<div>BlackRock supports equity plans
        that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of shareholders. We believe that boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could
        disrupt the intended alignment with shareholder interests (e.g. the use of stock as collateral for a loan; the use of stock in a margin account; the use of stock or an unvested award in hedging or derivative
        transactions). We may support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</div>
<div>Our evaluation of equity
        compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that
        contain “evergreen” provisions, which allow for the unlimited increase of shares reserved without requiring further shareholder approval after a reasonable time period. We also generally oppose plans that
        allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may also oppose plans that provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. We encourage
        companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee before acceleration or special payments are triggered.</div>
<div>Golden parachutes</div>
<div>We generally view golden parachutes
        as encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to shareholders. However, a large potential pay-out under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a
        management team to support a sub-optimal sale price for a company. When determining whether to support or oppose an</div>

<div>
<div>advisory vote on a golden parachute plan, we
        normally support the plan unless it appears to result in payments that are excessive or detrimental to shareholders. In evaluating golden parachute plans, BlackRock may consider several factors, including:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Whether we believe that the triggering event is in the best interest of shareholders
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>

                    </td>
<td>Whether management attempted to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Whether excessively large excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Whether the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light of performance and peers
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Whether the golden parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to effectively manage the company
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>It may be difficult to anticipate
        the results of a plan until after it has been triggered; as a result, BlackRock may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved by shareholders when it was
        implemented.</div>
<div>We may support shareholder
        proposals requesting that implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval. We generally support proposals requiring shareholder approval of plans that exceed 2.99 times an executive’s current
        salary and bonus, including equity compensation.</div>
<div>Option exchanges</div>
<div>We believe that there may be
        legitimate instances where underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case -by-case basis.
        BlackRock may support a request to reprice or exchange underwater options under the following circumstances:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual company performance
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Directors and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax, accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully
                    contemplated
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>There is clear evidence that absent repricing, the company will suffer serious employee incentive or retention and recruiting problems
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>BlackRock may also support a
        request to exchange underwater options in other circumstances, if we determine that the exchange is in the best interest of shareholders.</div>
<div>Pay-for-Performance plans</div>
<div>In order for executive compensation
        exceeding $1 million USD to qualify for federal tax deductions, related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) requires companies to link
        compensation for the company’s top five executives to disclosed performance goals and submit the plans for shareholder approval. The law further requires that a compensation committee comprised solely of outside
        directors administer these plans. Because the primary objective of these proposals is to preserve the deductibility of such compensation, we generally favor approval in order to preserve net income.</div>
<div>Supplemental executive retirement
        plans</div>
<div>BlackRock may support shareholder
        proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not
        contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employee-wide plans.</div>
<div>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES</div>

        protect and enhance their economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well -managed</div>

<div>
<div>companies will deal effectively with the material
        environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses. Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;
        S risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to
        issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB
        and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations
        provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality
        map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking
        undertaken, and verification process in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with
        companies for several years on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically
        ask companies to:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Publish disclosures in line with industry specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their
                    particular business; and
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Disclose climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a
                    scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines.

</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and
        our engagements to ascertain whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including
        BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>We believe that when a company is
        not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the
        election of directors where we have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such
        concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S
        factors. In deciding our course of action, we will assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company is in the process of actively implementing a response
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>There is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder

<div>We do not see it as our role to
        make social, ethical, or political judgments on behalf of clients, but rather, to protect the ir long-term economic interests as shareholders. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and
        regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are contradictory or ambiguous.</div>
<div>Climate risk</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out
        above, as well as our guidance on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long-
        term financial sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate-related risks and
        opportunities.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>We expect companies to help their
        investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around
        this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how
        climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk.</div>
<div>Where a company receives a
        shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of
        its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree
        that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>Corporate political activities</div>
<div>Companies may engage in certain
        political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to influence public policy consistent with the companies’ values and strategies, and thus serve shareholders’ best long-term economic
        interests. These activities can create risks, including: the potential for allegations of corruption; the potential for reputational issues associated with a candidate, party, or issue; and risks that arise from the
        complex legal, regulatory , and compliance considerations associated with corporate political activity. We believe that companies which choose to engage in political activities should develop and maintain robust
        processes to guide these activities and to mitigate risks, including a level of board oversight.</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder
        proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view regarding the
        associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards and management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals
        that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may decide to support a shareholder proposal requesting additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat
        or actual harm to shareholders’ interests, and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk.</div>
<div>Finally, we believe that it is not
        the role of shareholders to suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div>
<div>GENERAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
        MATTERS</div>
<div>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional
        votes</div>
<div>We generally support such proposals
        unless the agenda contains items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best long-term economic interests.</div>
<div>Bundled proposals</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should
        have the opportunity to review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BlackRock may reject certain positive
        changes when linked with proposals that generally contradict or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Exclusive forum provisions</div>
<div>BlackRock generally supports
        proposals to seek exclusive forum for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board unilaterally adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote
        against the independent chair or lead independent director and members of the governance committee.</div>
<div>Multi-jurisdictional companies</div>
<div>Where a company is listed on
        multiple exchanges or incorporated in a country different from its primary listing, we will seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific
        proposals</div>

<div>on the shareholder meeting agenda. In doing so, we
        typically consider the governance standards of the company’s primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs itself, and the market context of each specific proposal on the agenda. If the
        relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. We expect that
        companies will disclose the rationale for their selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, in particular where there is conflict between relevant market governance
        practices.</div>
<div>Other business</div>
<div>We oppose giving companies our
        proxy to vote on matters where we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight.</div>
<div>Reincorporation</div>
<div>Proposals to reincorporate from one
        state or country to another are most frequently motivated by considerations of anti - takeover protections, legal advantages, and / or cost savings. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the economic and
        strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to reincorporate. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protection under the new charter / articles / bylaws to assess whether the move
        increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections are diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</div>
<div>IPO governance</div>
<div>We expect boards to consider and
        disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon initial public offering (“IPO”) are in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also expect boards to conduct a regular review of
        corporate governance and control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our
        <font>letter on unequal voting structures</font>, we articulate our view that “one vote for one share” is the preferred structure for publicly -traded companies. We also
        recognize the potential benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, we believe that these structures should have a specific and limited duration. We will generally
        engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we believe that such arrangements may not be in the best interest of shareholders in the long-term.</div>
<div>We will typically apply a one-year
        grace period for the application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, director independence and over-boarding considerations), during which we expect boards to take steps to bring
        corporate governance standards in line with our expectations.</div>
<div>Further, if a company qualifies as
        an emerging growth company (an “EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted
        under the JOBS Act for the duration such a company is categorized as an EGC. We expect an EGC to have a totally independent audit committee by the first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on
        auditors and audit -related issues applicable in full for an EGC on the first anniversary of its IPO.</div>
<div>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS</div>
<div>Amendment to charter / articles /
        bylaws</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should
        have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including on changes to governance mechanisms and amendments to the charter / articles / bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to
        governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a reasonable period of time, in particular if those changes have the potential to impact shareholder rights ( see “Director elections” herein).
        In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes to the charter / articles / bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we may support such action if it
        does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance structure.</div>
<div>When voting on a management or
        shareholder proposal to make changes to the charter / articles / bylaws, we will consider in part the company’s and / or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes, the company’s
        governance profile and history, relevant jurisdictional laws, and situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed</div>

<div>changes, among other factors. We will typically
        support changes to the charter / articles / bylaws where the benefits to shareholders, including the costs of failing to make those changes, demonstrably outweigh the costs or risks of making such changes.</div>
<div>Proxy access</div>
<div>We believe that long-term
        shareholders should have the opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</div>
<div>In our view, securing the right of
        shareholders to nominate directors without engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, stimulate board attention to shareholder
        interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of directing that attention where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right without
        stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that the mechanism will not be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the
        company, or investors seeking to take control of the board.</div>
<div>In general, we support
        market-standardized proxy access proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate
        the greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</div>
<div>Right to act by written consent</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and
        with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders
        should have the right to solicit votes by written consent provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in
        addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent. We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act
        by written consent in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the board from incorporating appropriate
        mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the company
        already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that we believe offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a
        meeting.</div>
<div>Right to call a special meeting</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and
        with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders
        should have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of 15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is
        called, in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests. However, we may oppose this right in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant
        shareholder to the exclusion of others. We generally believe that a right to act via written consent is not a sufficient alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</div>
<div>Simple majority voting</div>
<div>We generally favor a simple
        majority voting requirement to pass proposals. Therefore, we will support the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders’ ability to protect
        their economic interests is improved. Nonetheless, in situations where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder, supermajority voting may be protective of public shareholder interests and we may support
        supermajority requirements in those situations.</div>

<div><a name="Appendix">Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</a></div>
<div>A rating is generally assigned to a
        fixed-income security at the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise
        such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a particular subsequent date.</div>
<div>NRSROs may rate specific
        investments (<font>e.g.</font>, bonds), issuers (<font>e.g.</font>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) and/or programs (<font>e.g.</font>, commercial paper programs). However, certain types of investments generally are not rated by NRSROs, such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities,
        commercial paper, time deposits at financial institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury securities (some of which are not rated),
        where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same NRSRO
        rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings for the same security (<font>e.g.</font>, “underlying,” “insured” and/or “enhanced” ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</div>
<div>New issue securities (regardless of
        type) rarely are rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities often include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the
        underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected
        rating to the security based on: (i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s rating for the issuer of the security set forth
        in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</div>
<div>Where the investment objective of a
        Fund is to track the performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined
        by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest,
        directly or indirectly, in securities that are not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index methodology in various circumstances, including
        where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or restructuring affecting an
        issuer of a security held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Fixed-income securities which are
        unrated expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the
        investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</div>
<div>Investors should note that the
        assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</div>
<div>Securities deemed to be high yield
        are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</div>
<div>The descriptions below relate to
        general long-term and short-term obligations of an issuer.</div>
<div>Moody’s Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Aaa:<font> Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Aa:<font> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Baa:<font> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.</font></div>

        </a>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Ba:<font> Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Caa:<font> Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative, of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Ca:<font> Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its
        generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>
<div>Absence of Rating:<font> Where no rating has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font></div>
<div>Should no rating be assigned, the
        reason may be one of the following:</div>
<div>1. An application was not received
        or accepted.</div>
<div>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a
        group of securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</div>
<div>3. There is a lack of essential
        data pertaining to the issue or issuer.</div>
<div>4. The issue was privately placed,
        in which case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</div>
<div>Withdrawal may occur if new and
        material circumstances arise, the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if a bond is called for redemption; or
        for other reasons.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Moody’s short-term debt
        ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations, generally with an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</div>
<div>Moody's employs the following
        designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</div>
<div>P-1: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-2: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-3: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div>
<div>NP: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div>US Municipal Short-Term Debt
        Obligations</div>
<div>There are three rating categories
        for short-term municipal obligations that are considered investment grade and are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are
        designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation.</div>
<div>MIG 1:<font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the
        market for refinancing.</font></div>
<div>MIG 2:<font> This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.</font></div>
<div>MIG 3:<font> This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div>

<div>S&amp;P Global Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> An obligation rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely
        strong.</font></div>
<div>AA:<font> An obligation rated AA differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment is very strong.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> An obligation rated A is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the
        obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong.</font></div>
<div>BBB:<font> An obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the
        obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:<font> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such
        obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font></div>
<div>BB:<font> An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic
        conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse
        business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment
        on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> An obligation rated CC is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual
        certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> An obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that
        are rated higher.</font></div>
<div>D:<font> An obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the
        date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days.
        The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An
        obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>
<div>NR:<font> NR indicates no rating has been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a
        matter of policy.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>A-1: <font>A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within
        this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>A-2: <font>A short-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories.
        However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.</font></div>
<div>A-3: <font>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of
        the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>B: <font>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however,
        it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>C: <font>A short-term obligation rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial
        commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>D: <font>A short-term obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not
        made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business days will be treated as five
        business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay
        provisions. An obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note
        rating reflects S&amp;P Global Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original
        maturity of more than three years will most likely receive a long-term debt rating.</div>
<div>SP-1:<font> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div>SP-2:<font> Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div>SP-3:<font> Speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>Fitch Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments.
        This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events.</font></div>
<div>AA:<font> Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not
        significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> High credit quality. A ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more
        vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.</font></div>
<div>BBB:<font> Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business
        or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>BB:<font> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or
        financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Defaulted obligations typically are
        not assigned RD or D ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have
        comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</div>
<div>Note: The modifiers “+”
        or “-” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in
        the categories below CCC.</div>
<div>The subscript 'emr' is appended to
        a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant to
        indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments
        where the principal is to any degree subject to market risk.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and
        Public Finance)</div>
<div>A short-term issuer or obligation
        rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing
        the relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as “short-term” based on market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate,
        sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</div>
<div>F1:<font> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally
        strong credit feature.</font></div>
<div>F2:<font> Good short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>F3:<font> Fair short-term credit quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic
        conditions.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div>
<div>RD:<font> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to
        entity ratings only.</font></div>
<div>D:<font> Default. Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</font></div>
