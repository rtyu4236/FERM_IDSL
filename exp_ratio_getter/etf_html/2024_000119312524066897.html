Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including but not limited to, transaction costs, asset valuations, timing variances and </span><span>differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the </span><span>Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may </span><span>underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, </span><span>groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, markets, market </span><span>segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities</span><span> </span><span>and indexes may </span><span>experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the </span><span>general financial markets depending upon a number of factors including, among other </span><span>things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or </span><span>resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to </span><span>underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds </span><span>as bonds in its portfolio mature or are near maturity, or bonds in the Underlying Index </span><span>are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. The Index </span><span>Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, for example, when </span><span>the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying Index’s stated </span><span>maturity guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income </span><span>markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Fund. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may </span><span>lead to lower trading volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less </span><span>transparent pricing in certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an </span><span>issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal </span><span>or interest when due.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in U.S. Treasury STRIPS. </span><span>U.S. Treasury STRIPS are created when </span><span>the interest and principal components of a U.S. Treasury note or bond are separated </span><span>and sold as separate securities. STRIPS are also called </span><span>“</span><span>zero-coupon</span><span>”</span><span> securities </span><span>because they do not make periodic interest payments and therefore have longer </span><span>durations than U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturities that distribute interest on a </span><span>current basis. Instead, they are typically sold at a discount from their face value and </span><span>can be redeemed at face value when they mature. U.S. Treasury STRIPS only make a </span><span>payment upon maturity. As a result, the market value of U.S. Treasury STRIPS is </span><span>generally more volatile than the value of other fixed-income securities with similar </span><span>maturities that make periodic interest payments. U.S. Treasury STRIPS generally </span><span>respond to changes in interest rates to a greater degree than other fixed-income </span><span>securities with similar maturities and credit quality. U.S. Treasury STRIPS generally lose </span><span>value when interest rates rise. The Fund is generally required to distribute investment </span><span>income as cash dividends to Fund shareholders, but because U.S. Treasury STRIPS do </span><span>not pay interest and are typically purchased at an </span><span>“</span><span>original issue discount,</span><span>”</span><span> the Fund </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>does not receive cash interest payments on the STRIPS in which it invests. As a result, </span><span>the Fund may need to liquidate assets, at potentially inopportune times, to satisfy such </span><span>income dividend distribution requirements. The timely payment of principal on these </span><span>securities remains guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that </span><span>could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, </span><span>such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in </span><span>substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers </span><span>as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs </span><span>incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of </span><span>the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through </span><span>tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital </span><span>gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index </span><span>or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory </span><span>requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of </span><span>increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may </span><span>result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>not. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING </span><span>ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs.</span></div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other </span><span>securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other </span><span>characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit </span><span>rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury </span><span>obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A </span><span>downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are </span><span>often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, a downgrade could also </span><span>result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the </span><span>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and </span><span>global economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding </span><span>needs, which may drive debt cost higher and lead the government to issue additional </span><span>debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises concerns that </span><span>the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they </span><span>are due. If market participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become </span><span>unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus increasing inflationary </span><span>pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and </span><span>imported goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing </span><span>effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns. Direct obligations of the </span><span>U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </span><span>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may </span><span>vary during the period that shareholders own shares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, </span><span>circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or </span><span>principal, such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would </span><span>result in losses to the Fund and substantial negative consequences for the U.S. </span><span>economy and the global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2023, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, net of any applicable </span><span>waivers, at the annual rate of 0.04%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of </span><span>its management fee so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after the </span><span>fee waiver will not exceed 0.10% through February 28, 2029. The contractual waiver </span><span>may be terminated prior to February 28, 2029 only upon written agreement of the </span><span>Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or </span><span>reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses </span><span>(excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or </span><span>reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

As of March 31, 2023, BFA and its </span><span>affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets of approximately $9.1 </span><span>trillion.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the </span><span>returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the </span><span>loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to </span><span>which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>).

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>GOVZ.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the </span><span>Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The </span><span>Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term </span><span>capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have </span><span>held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of </span><span>15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income </span><span>exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% </span><span>U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with </span><span>incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates </span><span>and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the </span><span>year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated </span><span>as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund.

The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

The </span><span>Index Provider is an affiliated person of the iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF and iShares Investment Grade Systematic </span><span>Bond ETF and of BFA.

ABS are </span><span>“</span><span>pass-through</span><span>”</span><span> securities, meaning that principal and interest payments, net of </span><span>expenses, made by the borrower on the underlying assets are passed through to a Fund. ABS, like traditional fixed-income </span><span>securities, are subject to credit, interest rate, call, prepayment, extension, valuation and illiquidity risk. Because of call, </span><span>prepayment, and extension risk, however, ABS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small </span><span>movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain ABS. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The price paid by a Fund for its ABS, the yield a Fund expects to receive from such securities and the average life of such </span><span>securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying assets. During </span><span>periods of difficulty in the credit markets, ABS may decline in value and become less liquid, more volatile, and more difficult </span><span>to value.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets may subject ABS to additional risks in comparison to mortgage-backed</span><span> securities. For instance, certain ABS generally do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral that is </span><span>comparable in quality to mortgage-backed assets. The value of the collateral may also be insufficient to cover the principal </span><span>amount of the obligation. Other ABS, such as those backed by credit card receivables, do not have the benefit of a security </span><span>interest in collateral at all. Moreover, the values of ABS may be substantially dependent on the servicing of the underlying </span><span>asset pools, and are therefore subject to risks associated with the negligence or malfeasance by their servicers and to the </span><span>credit risk of their servicers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ABS are often not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are subject to risk of default on the </span><span>underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Bonds.</span><span>  </span><span> Each Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing </span><span>security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company or governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay </span><span>interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity </span><span>date. Bonds generally are used by issuers to borrow money from investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An issuer may have the right to redeem or </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> a bond before maturity, in which case the Fund may have to reinvest the </span><span>proceeds at lower market rates.</span><span> </span><span>Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds </span><span>mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a </span><span>“</span><span>coupon</span><span>”</span><span> rate that is fixed for the life of the </span><span>bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. </span><span>Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its </span><span>value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is </span><span>purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its </span><span>face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less </span><span>current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such </span><span>fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of </span><span>bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on </span><span>“</span><span>floating rate</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>variable rate</span><span>”</span><span> bonds </span><span>may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final maturities. </span><span>Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of </span><span>“</span><span>floating rate</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>variable rate</span><span>”</span><span> bonds fluctuates much less in </span><span>response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline if their interest </span><span>rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a </span><span>shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally, prices of </span><span>higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices </span><span>of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated </span><span>obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets and, in the event of </span><span>liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general </span><span>creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and </span><span>iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the </span><span>Bank of New York Mellon (</span><span>“</span><span>BNY</span><span>”</span><span>), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of </span><span>credit may be used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of </span><span>portfolio holdings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) published </span><span>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a spread. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if SOFR were to cease </span><span>being published or representative, it would be replaced by a rate based on an alternate benchmark selected by BNY.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Brady Bonds. </span><span> </span><span>Certain of the Funds may invest in Brady bonds. Brady bonds are securities created through the exchange of </span><span>existing commercial bank loans to public and private entities in certain emerging markets for new bonds in connection with </span><span>debt restructurings. Brady bonds have been issued since 1989. In light of the history of defaults of countries issuing Brady </span><span>bonds on their commercial bank loans, investments in Brady bonds may be viewed as speculative and subject to the same </span><span>risks as emerging market securities. Brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or uncollateralized, are issued in U.S. </span><span>dollars and are actively traded in over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) secondary markets. Incomplete collateralization of interest or </span><span>principal payment obligations results in increased credit risk. U.S. dollar-denominated collateralized Brady bonds, which may </span><span>be either fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are generally collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The commercial mortgage-backed securities (</span><span>“</span><span>CMBS</span><span>”</span><span>) in which a Fund </span><span>invests may be issued by entities, such as banks, mortgage lenders or other institutions. These entities are not backed by the </span><span>full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial </span><span>support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CMBS depend on cash flows generated by underlying commercial real-estate loans, receivables or other assets, and can be </span><span>significantly affected by changes in interest rates, the availability of information concerning the underlying assets and their </span><span>structure, and the creditworthiness of the originators of the underlying assets. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Due to the nature of the loans they represent, CMBS are subject to a greater degree of prepayment and extension risk than </span><span>many other forms of fixed-income securities. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly </span><span>and significantly reduce the value of certain CMBS. Certain CMBS are issued in several classes with different levels of yield </span><span>and credit protection. A Fund’s investments in CMBS with several classes may be in the lower classes that have greater risks </span><span>than the higher classes, including greater interest rate, credit, prepayment and extension risks. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the value of CMBS may be adversely affected by regulatory or tax changes. CMBS issued by non-government </span><span>entities may offer higher yields than those issued by government entities, but also may be subject to greater volatility than </span><span>government issues. In the recent past, the market for CMBS has experienced volatility and reduced liquidity. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate Bonds.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund (other than the iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, Treasury Bond Funds and </span><span>the Municipal Bond Funds) may invest in investment-grade and/or high yield corporate bonds. High yield corporate bonds </span><span>may be deemed speculative and more volatile than higher rated securities of similar maturity. The investment return of </span><span>corporate bonds reflects interest earned on the security and changes in the market value of the security. The market value of </span><span>a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market rate of interest, the credit rating of the issuer, the issuer’s </span><span>performance and perceptions of the issuer in the marketplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the securities may not be </span><span>able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by an instrument.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Diversification Status.</span><span>  </span><span> The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

Each Fund </span><span>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </span><span>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and </span><span>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated </span><span>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </span><span>of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </span><span>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of </span><span>this SAI for more information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs.

The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures </span><span>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </span><span>the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing </span><span>positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </span><span>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </span><span>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the </span><span>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time.

The initial purchaser of a call </span><span>option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </span><span>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market </span><span>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </span><span>to purchase.

While generally providing greater income and opportunity for gain, </span><span>non-investment grade debt securities may be subject to greater risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including </span><span>a high risk of default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. High yield securities will generally be in the lower rating </span><span>categories of recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Moody's</span><span>”</span><span>) or below BBB- by </span><span>Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (</span><span>“</span><span>S&amp;P Global Ratings</span><span>”</span><span>) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Fitch</span><span>”</span><span>)) or be </span><span>unrated. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from </span><span>time to time change, positively or negatively, to reflect developments regarding the issuer’s financial condition. High yield </span><span>securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest </span><span>in accordance with the terms of the obligation and may have more credit risk than higher rated securities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield bond investments include the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. These securities are vulnerable to adverse changes in </span><span>the issuer’s industry or to general economic conditions. Issuers of high yield bonds may be unable to meet their </span><span>interest or principal payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer developments or the </span><span>unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The issuers of high yield bonds may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than issuers of </span><span>investment grade bonds. If the issuer experiences financial stress, it may be unable to meet its debt obligations. The </span><span>issuer’s ability to pay its debt obligations also may be lessened by specific issuer developments, or the unavailability </span><span>of additional financing. Issuers of high yield securities are often in the growth stage of their development and/or </span><span>involved in a reorganization or takeover.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds are frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its obligations, </span><span>the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit a Fund’s ability </span><span>to fully recover principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to receive </span><span>restructuring benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities </span><span>frequently have a lower degree of protection with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in </span><span>higher rated securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the security from a Fund </span><span>before it matures. If an issuer redeems the high yield bonds, a Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds with </span><span>lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield bonds are subject to extreme fluctuations. Negative economic developments may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield bonds than on those of other higher rated fixed-income securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Under certain economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield </span><span>securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. There are fewer dealers in the high </span><span>yield bond market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for high yield bonds by dealers, and </span><span>such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. Judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>the prices and values generated for such securities than in the case of securities trading in a more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The secondary markets for high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for higher rated </span><span>securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and, </span><span>participants in the markets are mostly institutional investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial </span><span>institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that </span><span>for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could contract under adverse market or economic conditions </span><span>independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or </span><span>market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield securities due to the limited number of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the market price of the high </span><span>yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and obtaining accurate market </span><span>quotations on the issue when valuing a Fund's assets. Market quotations on high yield securities are available only </span><span>from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. </span><span>When the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, or in the absence of readily available </span><span>market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable objective data makes it more difficult to value such </span><span>securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such valuations.</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a </span><span>defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The high yield bond markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy, or to the </span><span>perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis. Additionally, prices </span><span>for high yield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could </span><span>adversely affect a Fund’s NAV and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial </span><span>condition of issuers of these securities and the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a </span><span>thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured savings and loan </span><span>associations of their investments in high yield bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by certain corporate </span><span>issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </span><span>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total </span><span>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </span><span>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </span><span>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </span><span>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </span><span>are subject to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </span><span>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to </span><span>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </span><span>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending </span><span>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </span><span>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a </span><span>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span><span>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the </span><span>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </span><span>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </span><span>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </span><span>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income.

Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </span><span>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </span><span>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </span><span>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </span><span>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has </span><span>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </span><span>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </span><span>“</span><span>highly liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>moderately liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>less liquid investment</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>illiquid investment.</span><span>”</span><span> The Liquidity Rule defines </span><span>“</span><span>liquidity risk</span><span>”</span><span> as </span><span>the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining </span><span>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </span><span>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the </span><span>liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an </span><span>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </span><span>liquidity risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal Insurance. </span><span> </span><span>A municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment of </span><span>interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by either (i) the issuer at the time the bond is </span><span>issued (primary market insurance), or (ii) another party after the bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Both primary and secondary market insurance guarantee timely and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all </span><span>interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing </span><span>its credit quality and value.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal security insurance does not insure against market fluctuations or fluctuations in each of the Municipal Bond </span><span>Funds' share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security </span><span>before maturity (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying </span><span>agent, or (iii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or any </span><span>other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the bond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may be a </span><span>provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may be retired before maturity.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because a significant portion of the municipal securities issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance </span><span>companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a significant adverse effect on the value </span><span>of the securities insured by that insurance company and on the municipal markets as a whole.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain significant providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of </span><span>exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or </span><span>otherwise suffered extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into </span><span>question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the </span><span>future. While an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a </span><span>municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by </span><span>the insurer, the value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal </span><span>security independent of insurance.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Certain of the Funds invest in securities issued in the U.S. market by U.S. states and territories, </span><span>municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies </span><span>or authorities (</span><span>“</span><span>municipal securities</span><span>”</span><span>), the interest payments of which are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. The </span><span>municipal securities which such Funds may purchase include general obligation bonds and limited obligation bonds (or </span><span>“</span><span>Revenue Bonds</span><span>”</span><span>), including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law.</span></div> <div> <div><span>General obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such </span><span>issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Revenue Bonds are payable only from the revenues derived </span><span>from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue </span><span>source. Revenue Bonds that are issued to finance a particular project often depend on revenues from that project to make </span><span>principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower </span><span>revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Additionally, the market values of Revenue Bonds may decline in times of </span><span>higher inflation to the extent that revenues are fixed income streams. In other instances, the prices that certain Revenue Bond </span><span>issuers are able to charge users of their assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual </span><span>arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the issuer’s revenues. Additionally, rising </span><span>interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for issuers of both general obligation bonds and Revenue Bonds, which </span><span>could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell </span><span>municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is </span><span>generally characterized as a buy and hold investment strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the </span><span>market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and lessens as the securities move further </span><span>away from such issuance date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some longer-term municipal securities give the investor the right to </span><span>“</span><span>put</span><span>”</span><span> or sell the security at par (face value) within a </span><span>specified number of days following the investor’s request - usually one to seven days. This demand feature enhances a </span><span>security’s liquidity by shortening its effective maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a </span><span>demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term security, which could experience </span><span>substantially more volatility.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal securities are subject to credit and market risk. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more </span><span>with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate </span><span>more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prices and yields on municipal securities are dependent on a variety of factors, including general money-market conditions, </span><span>the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the </span><span>maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are </span><span>subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not </span><span>be as extensive as that which is made available by corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal </span><span>securities may be more difficult to value than securities of public corporations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, </span><span>may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or </span><span>state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints </span><span>upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the risk that their tax treatment could </span><span>be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of </span><span>litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the </span><span>payment of interest and principal on their municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found </span><span>to be invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing </span><span>uncertainties in the market for municipal securities or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the credit risk with </span><span>respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial </span><span>portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in the same manner.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, certain municipal securities are issued by entities dependent on revenue from a particular sector and thus are </span><span>subject to the specific risks associated with that sector. These sectors are described in more detail below.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Health Care-Related Municipal Securities. </span><span>Changes to state or federal policy tied to health care services </span><span>could adversely affect the value of municipal securities backed by revenue from public hospitals and other health care </span><span>facilities. Regulatory changes that govern cost reimbursements to health care providers under government-funded programs </span><span>such as Medicare and Medicaid, including policies that award exclusive contracts to certain hospitals, may adversely affect </span><span>the revenue streams backing certain municipal securities. Additionally, the expansion of healthcare facilities by some issuers </span><span>may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by various regulators or other authorities. This process not only generally </span><span>increases the time and expenses such expansions entail, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, thus potentially limiting </span><span>the revenue and growth of healthcare facility operators. Moreover, local, state and federal governmental bodies are under </span><span>increasing pressure to reduce medical spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory </span><span>processes and public funding available for healthcare services and facilities. The value of healthcare-related municipal </span><span>securities could also be affected by a variety of other factors that impact the underlying healthcare facilities including </span><span>demand for services, the ability of the health care facility to provide the services required, competition with other facilities, </span><span>and expenses (such as malpractice insurance premiums).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.</span><span> Entities that issue municipal securities related to infrastructure </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>infrastructure issuers</span><span>”</span><span>) may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their capacity to make principal </span><span>and interest payments, such as high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of </span><span>leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, </span><span>increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on </span><span>infrastructure projects, and other factors. Such issuers may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in </span><span>exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. Infrastructure </span><span>issuers can be significantly affected by government spending policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Infrastructure issuers can be highly indebted, which increases investment risk and other risks normally </span><span>associated with debt financing, which could adversely affect such an issuer’s operations and the market value of related </span><span>municipal securities in periods of rising interest rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operations Risk.</span><span> The failure of an infrastructure issuer to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately </span><span>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic </span><span>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Infrastructure projects may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and </span><span>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </span><span>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Strategic Asset Risk.</span><span> Infrastructure issuers may control significant strategic assets (e.g., major pipelines or highways), </span><span>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or </span><span>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry </span><span>sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>User Risk.</span><span> Infrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a narrow user base. If these users do not patronize infrastructure </span><span>projects as expected, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable, in which case infrastructure issuers </span><span>may fail to pay their obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Municipal Securities Issued By School Districts.</span><span> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations </span><span>from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school </span><span>districts may be adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or </span><span>other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Investors in these securities, similar to investors in </span><span>municipal securities generally, face heightened risk of loss upon insolvency of the school district issuers because there is </span><span>often no ready source of funding to pay the bonds other than the local tax base, which a bankruptcy court or administrator </span><span>does not control.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Transportation Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.</span><span> The transportation infrastructure industry may </span><span>be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and other operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, </span><span>in many jurisdictions, the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Municipal securities that are issued to </span><span>finance a particular transportation project (e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and </span><span>interest payments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Utility-Related Municipal Securities.</span><span> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including </span><span>state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. Various </span><span>future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing </span><span>requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of </span><span>environmental and other governmental regulations. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. For example, gas utilities are </span><span>subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas </span><span>utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for </span><span>the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas </span><span>utility.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The types of municipal securities in which the Funds may invest include, but are not limited, to the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Industrial Development Bonds</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Industrial development bonds generally are also Revenue Bonds and thus are not payable from the issuer’s general revenues. </span><span>The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. </span><span>Payment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any </span><span>guarantor).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Private Activity Bonds</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain of the Funds may invest in private activity bonds, which are bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to </span><span>obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities, sewage disposal, solid </span><span>waste disposal or hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or </span><span>electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for the construction, equipment, repair or </span><span>improvement of privately operated industrial or commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the </span><span>current U.S. federal tax laws place substantial limitations on the size of such issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal Lease Obligations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds may invest in municipal lease obligations, including certificates of participation (</span><span>“</span><span>COPs</span><span>”</span><span>) issued by government </span><span>authorities or entities to finance the acquisition or construction of equipment, land and/or facilities. The COPs represent </span><span>participations in a lease, an installment purchase contract, or a conditional sales contract relating to equipment, land or </span><span>facilities. As a result of their structure, COPs are generally not subject to constitutional debt limitations or other statutory </span><span>requirements that may apply to other municipal securities. Municipal governments may not be obligated to make lease or </span><span>installment purchase payments in connection with COPs, and, in such circumstances, the COP will be secured only by the </span><span>leased property. If the issuer of a COP does not fulfill its payment obligation, it may be difficult to sell the property and the </span><span>proceeds of a sale may not cover the Fund’s loss. Municipal lease obligations may be less liquid than conventional municipal </span><span>bonds, but otherwise have the same general risk characteristics as other municipal securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tender Option Bonds</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tender option bonds are synthetic floating rate or variable rate securities issued when long-term bonds are purchased in the </span><span>primary or secondary market and then deposited into a trust. Custodial receipts are then issued to investors in these </span><span>securities evidencing ownership interests in the trust. The remarketing agent for the trust sets a floating or variable rate on </span><span>typically a weekly basis. The sponsor of a highly leveraged tender option bond trust generally will retain a liquidity provider to </span><span>purchase the short-term floating rate interests at their original purchase price upon the occurrence of certain specified </span><span>events. However, the liquidity provider may not be required to purchase the floating rate interests upon the occurrence of </span><span>certain other events, for example, the downgrading of the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust below </span><span>investment-grade or certain events that indicate the issuer of the bonds may be entering bankruptcy. The general effect of </span><span>these provisions is to pass to the holders of the floating rate interests the most severe credit risks associated with the </span><span>municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust and to leave with the liquidity provider the interest rate risk (subject </span><span>to a cap) and certain other risks associated with the municipal bonds. Tender option bonds may be considered derivatives, </span><span>and may expose the Funds to the same risks as investments in derivatives, as well as risks associated with leverage, especially </span><span>the risk of increased volatility. To the extent the Funds invest in tender option bonds, they also are exposed to credit risk </span><span>associated with the liquidity provider retained by the sponsor of a tender bond option trust.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

There is the possibility that because of </span><span>default or insolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not be honored. The interest rates are adjustable at intervals </span><span>(ranging from daily to up to one year) to some prevailing market rate for similar investments, such adjustment formula being </span><span>calculated to maintain the market rate of the VRDOs at approximately the par value of the VRDOs on the adjustment date. </span><span>The adjustments typically are based upon the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Index or some other </span><span>appropriate interest rate adjustment index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because of the interest rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are not comparable to fixed-rate securities. During periods of </span><span>declining interest rates, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its shareholders will forego the opportunity for capital </span><span>appreciation. During periods of rising interest rates, however, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will increase and its shareholders will </span><span>have a reduced risk of capital depreciation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal Notes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal notes (also known as municipal commercial paper) are shorter-term municipal debt obligations. They may provide </span><span>interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants, bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in the </span><span>anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may be delayed or the note may not be fully repaid, and the Funds may </span><span>lose money.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal commercial paper is generally unsecured and issued to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security </span><span>presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only out </span><span>of the assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors are repaid.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers may be deemed to be located in a particular country </span><span>if: (i) the principal trading market for the security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the laws of such </span><span>country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets </span><span>situated in such country or, (iv) the issuer is the government of the particular country.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities.</span><span>  </span><span> The iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF may not </span><span>invest in private placements, but may invest in certain bonds registered with the SEC or exempt from registration at the time </span><span>of issuance, or offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act with or without registration rights (</span><span>“</span><span>Rule 144A Bonds</span><span>”</span><span>).The </span><span>iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ </span><span>Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares BBB Rated Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Broad USD Investment Grade </span><span>Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate </span><span>Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx </span><span>$ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate </span><span>Government/Credit Bond ETF and iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF may invest in privately issued securities, including those </span><span>that may be resold only in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Restricted Securities</span><span>”</span><span>). Rule </span><span>144A Bonds and Restricted Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a </span><span>purchaser's ability to acquire or resell such securities. Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for specific Rule 144A Bonds </span><span>and Restricted Securities may vary.

The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </span><span>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC </span><span>Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> or a </span><span>vehicle for trading such instruments.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 </span><span>under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds.

BFA </span><span>may not have transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this </span><span>issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund </span><span>that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to </span><span>delay registration as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional </span><span>guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds.

Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </span><span>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase </span><span>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </span><span>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </span><span>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are </span><span>inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties </span><span>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer </span><span>maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If </span><span>the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher </span><span>quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s </span><span>repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position a </span><span>Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the </span><span>defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of </span><span>losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities </span><span>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </span><span>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </span><span>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </span><span>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required </span><span>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </span><span>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the </span><span>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </span><span>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </span><span>financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </span><span>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </span><span>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or </span><span>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.

Under the 1940 Act, </span><span>a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding </span><span>voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company, </span><span>and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law </span><span>or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment companies, including, but </span><span>not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits </span><span>discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for </span><span>operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. </span><span>Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in </span><span>connection with loans of securities are not treated as acquired fund fees and expenses, which reflect a Fund's </span><span>pro rata </span><span>share </span><span>of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies</span><span> </span><span>(as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable). </span><span> </span><span>The iShares National Muni Bond ETF may invest in shares of other iShares funds that provide substantially similar exposure </span><span>to the securities in its Underlying Index.

The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF may invest in shares of </span><span>other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates that provide substantially similar exposure to the </span><span>securities in its Underlying Index. BFA will not charge advisory fees on that portion of the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond </span><span>ETF's assets invested in shares of other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span> Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable </span><span>rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market </span><span>instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term</span><span> investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA </span><span>or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, </span><span>fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; </span><span>(iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's, </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Fitch or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or </span><span>if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds and </span><span>debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to </span><span>present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase </span><span>agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the </span><span>opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these </span><span>instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained </span><span>in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on </span><span>commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations. </span><span> </span><span>Certain of the Funds may invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign obligations. </span><span>An investment in sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt </span><span>includes securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued </span><span>or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically </span><span>less liquid and less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the </span><span>repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and a Fund may have limited </span><span>recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a non-U.S. </span><span>government may cause the value of a sovereign debt to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of </span><span>sovereign debt obligations may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations, which may affect a Fund's NAV. In the </span><span>past, certain emerging market countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld payments </span><span>of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. Several </span><span>sovereign issuers have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about rising government debt levels, </span><span>including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In the past, sovereign issuers have also defaulted on their debt obligations, </span><span>including Russia, Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among </span><span>other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its non-U.S. currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign </span><span>exchange, the relative size of the debt service burden, the sovereign debtor's policy toward principal international lenders and </span><span>local political constraints. Sovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, </span><span>multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce principal and interest arrears on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less </span><span>standardized than government debt.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </span><span>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </span><span>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </span><span>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </span><span>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </span><span>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The </span><span>use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with </span><span>ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other </span><span>underlying assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain of the Funds invest in securities backed by pools of mortgages </span><span>issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, including Government National </span><span>Mortgage Association (</span><span>“</span><span>Ginnie Mae</span><span>”</span><span>), Federal National Mortgage Association (</span><span>“</span><span>Fannie Mae</span><span>”</span><span>), and the Federal Home Loan </span><span>Mortgage Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>Freddie Mac</span><span>”</span><span>). The market for mortgage-backed securities (</span><span>“</span><span>MBS</span><span>”</span><span>) has been adversely affected by </span><span>the value of those MBS held and/or issued by these agencies and sponsored entities. If a U.S. government agency or </span><span>sponsored entity issues securities in which certain of the Funds invest and such issuer is unable to meet its obligations or </span><span>ceases to exist, and no plan is made for the repayment of securities, the performance of certain of the Funds will be adversely </span><span>impacted.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Ginnie Mae</span><span>. Established in 1968, Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned U.S. government corporation within the U.S. Department of </span><span>Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae is authorized to guarantee, with the backing of the full faith and credit of the </span><span>U.S. government, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the institutions approved by Ginnie Mae </span><span>(such as savings and loan institutions, commercial banks and mortgage banks), and backed by pools of mortgages insured </span><span>by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae securities also </span><span>are supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury Department to make payments under </span><span>its guarantee. Any actual or potential disruption to Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or credit of the U.S. government, </span><span>could cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. Treasury securities </span><span>from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used </span><span>as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate </span><span>borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A </span><span>downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global </span><span>Ratings may cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</span><span>. Fannie Mae was established as a federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was chartered by </span><span>Congress as a private shareholder-owned company. Securities issued by Fannie Mae are guaranteed as to timely payment of </span><span>principal and interest by Fannie Mae. The securities are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S. </span><span>government, but are supported by the right of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by Congress in 1970. Securities issued by Freddie Mac entitle the </span><span>holder to timely payment of interests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate </span><span>collection or timely payment of all principal payments. While Freddie Mac generally does not guarantee timely payment of </span><span>principal, Freddie Mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time </span><span>after default on an underlying mortgage, but in no event later than one year after it becomes payable. The securities are not </span><span>backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or by any Federal Home Loan Banks, but are </span><span>supported by the right of Freddie Mac to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into government conservatorship </span><span>in an effort to provide stability in the financial markets and put the government-sponsored entities in sound and solvent </span><span>condition. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of </span><span>capital each on an as needed basis to ensure that they continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mortgage-Backed Securities</span><span>. MBS issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, </span><span>such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in pools of mortgages in which payments of both </span><span>principal and interest on the securities are generally made monthly, in effect </span><span>“</span><span>passing through</span><span>”</span><span> the payments made by </span><span>borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the </span><span>securities). MBS differ from other forms of debt securities, which normally provide for periodic payment of interest in fixed </span><span>amounts with principal payments at maturity or specified call dates, while a MBS payments provide a combination of interest </span><span>and principal throughout the a bond’s term. As further described below, MBS may be structured as pass-through securities </span><span>or collateralized mortgage obligations (</span><span>“</span><span>CMOs</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div> <div><span>MBS are subject to the general risks associated with investing in real estate securities; that is, they may lose value if the value </span><span>of the underlying real estate to which a pool of mortgages relates declines. In addition, investments in MBS involve certain </span><span>specific risks. These risks include the failure of a party to meet its commitments under the related operative documents, </span><span>adverse interest rate changes and the effects of prepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value of MBS, like that of </span><span>traditional fixed-income securities, typically increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise. </span><span>However, MBS differ from traditional fixed-income securities because of their potential for prepayment without penalty. The </span><span>price paid by a Fund for its MBS, the yield a Fund expects to receive from such securities and the weighted average life of the </span><span>securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. In a </span><span>period of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay the underlying mortgages more quickly than anticipated, thereby </span><span>reducing the yield to maturity and the average life of the MBS. Moreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds of a </span><span>prepayment in these circumstances, it will likely receive a rate of interest that is lower than the rate on the security that was </span><span>prepaid.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent that a Fund purchases MBS at a premium, mortgage foreclosures and principal prepayments may result in a </span><span>loss to the extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys such securities at a discount, both scheduled payments of principal </span><span>and unscheduled prepayments will increase current and total returns and will accelerate the recognition of income, which, </span><span>when distributed to shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. In a period of rising interest rates, prepayments of the </span><span>underlying mortgages may occur at a slower than expected rate, creating maturity extension risk. This particular risk may </span><span>effectively change a security that was considered short- or intermediate-term at the time of purchase into a long-term </span><span>security. Since the value of long-term securities generally fluctuates more widely in response to changes in interest rates than </span><span>that of shorter-term securities, maturity extension risk could increase the inherent volatility of a Fund. Under certain interest </span><span>rate and prepayment scenarios, a Fund may fail to recoup fully its investment in MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect </span><span>U.S. governmental or agency guarantee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mortgage Pass-Through Securities</span><span>. Some MBS, such as U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities, represent a right to </span><span>receive principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages, which are passed through to security holders. In </span><span>the basic mortgage pass-through structure, mortgages with similar issuer, term and coupon characteristics are collected and </span><span>aggregated into a </span><span>“</span><span>pool</span><span>”</span><span> consisting of multiple mortgage loans. The pool is assigned a CUSIP number and undivided </span><span>interests in the pool are traded and sold as pass-through securities. The holder of the security is entitled to a pro rata share of </span><span>principal and interest payments (including unscheduled prepayments) from the pool of mortgage loans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in a specific pool of mortgage pass-through securities requires an analysis of the specific prepayment risk of </span><span>mortgages within the covered pool (since mortgagors typically have the option to prepay their loans). The level of </span><span>prepayments on a pool of MBS is difficult to predict and can impact the subsequent cash flows, value and yield of the </span><span>mortgage pool. In addition, when trading specific mortgage pools, precise execution, delivery and settlement arrangements </span><span>must be negotiated for each transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To-Be-Announced Securities</span><span>. A Fund may seek to gain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities by </span><span>investing in TBA securities. </span><span>“</span><span>TBAs</span><span>”</span><span> refer to a commonly used mechanism for the forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and </span><span>not to a separate type of MBS. Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through the use of TBA transactions. TBA </span><span>transactions generally are conducted in accordance with widely-accepted guidelines which establish commonly observed </span><span>terms and conditions for execution, settlement, and delivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and seller decide on general </span><span>trade parameters, such as the issuing agency, settlement date, par amount, and price. The actual mortgage pools delivered </span><span>generally are determined two days prior to settlement date. Certain of the Funds may regularly enter into TBA agreements </span><span>and </span><span>“</span><span>roll over</span><span>”</span><span> such agreements prior to the settlement date stipulated in such agreements. This type of TBA transaction is </span><span>sometimes known as a </span><span>“</span><span>TBA roll.</span><span>”</span><span> In a TBA roll, such Funds generally will sell the obligation to purchase the pools stipulated </span><span>in the TBA agreement prior to the stipulated settlement date and will enter into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>pools of MBS. In addition, certain of the Funds may enter into TBA agreements and settle such transactions on the stipulated </span><span>settlement date by accepting actual receipt or delivery of the pools of MBS stipulated in the TBA agreement.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain of the Funds may invest cash pending settlement of TBA transactions in money market instruments, repurchase </span><span>agreements, or other high quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money market funds advised by BFA. Each such </span><span>Fund will pay its </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to such </span><span>Fund’s own fees and expenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations</span><span>. U.S. agency MBS may also be structured in the form of CMOs. CMOs are created by </span><span>dividing the principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages into several revenue streams (</span><span>“</span><span>tranches</span><span>”</span><span>) with </span><span>different priority rights to portions of the underlying mortgage payments. Certain CMO tranches may represent a right to </span><span>receive interest only, principal only, or an amount that remains after floating-rate tranches are paid (an </span><span>“</span><span>inverse floater</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>These securities are frequently referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>mortgage derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> and may be extremely sensitive to changes in interest </span><span>rates. Interest rates on inverse floaters, for example, vary inversely with a short-term floating rate (which may be reset </span><span>periodically). Interest rates on inverse floaters will decrease when short-term rates increase and will increase when short-term</span><span> rates decrease. These securities have the effect of providing a degree of investment leverage. In response to changes in </span><span>market interest rates or other market conditions, the value of an inverse floater may increase or decrease at a multiple of the </span><span>increase or decrease in the value of the underlying securities. If a Fund invests in CMO tranches issued by U.S. government </span><span>agencies or sponsored entities and interest rates move in a manner not anticipated by BFA, it is possible that such a Fund </span><span>could lose all or substantially all of its investment. Certain CMOs in which certain of the Funds may invest may also provide a </span><span>degree of investment leverage, which could cause such a Fund to lose all or substantially all of its investment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Government Obligations. </span><span> </span><span>Certain of the Funds may invest in various types of U.S. government obligations. U.S. </span><span>government obligations are a type of bond and include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. </span><span>government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of principal and interest on U.S. government obligations (i) may be </span><span>backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the issuing or guaranteeing agency or </span><span>instrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan Bank notes). In the latter case, each Fund </span><span>must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which </span><span>agency or instrumentality may be privately owned. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide </span><span>financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. As a general matter, the value of debt </span><span>instruments, including U.S. government obligations, declines when market interest rates increase and rises when market </span><span>interest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S. government obligations are subject to fluctuations in yield or value due to their </span><span>structure or contract terms.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, purchase and guarantee residential mortgages and form </span><span>MBS that they issue to the market. These agencies also hold their own MBS as well as those of other institutions with funding </span><span>from the agency debentures they issue. Recent events in the markets for MBS have adversely affected the value of those MBS </span><span>held and/or issued by these agencies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S.-Registered and Restricted Securities of Non-U.S. Issuers.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Funds (other than the iShares Agency Bond ETF, iShares </span><span>MBS ETF, Municipal Bond Funds and Treasury Bond Funds) may invest in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of </span><span>non-U.S. governments, agencies, supranational entities and corporate issuers.

Investing in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds or Restricted Securities issued by non-U.S. </span><span>issuers involves some risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include </span><span>differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; </span><span>adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in </span><span>foreign countries; and potential restrictions of the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>securities may be affected by fluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange rates between the issuer's local currency and the </span><span>U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such </span><span>respects as growth of gross domestic product (</span><span>“</span><span>GDP</span><span>”</span><span>), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and </span><span>balance of payment positions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments </span><span>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment </span><span>objective and do not violate any investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus. </span><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may </span><span>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in </span><span>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any </span><span>particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by certain Funds may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the </span><span>security before its stated maturity, and a Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would </span><span>result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of </span><span>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </span><span>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </span><span>hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </span><span>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </span><span>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of </span><span>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </span><span>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than </span><span>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </span><span>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue </span><span>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </span><span>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </span><span>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </span><span>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for </span><span>compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Extension Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly </span><span>than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in a Fund’s income and </span><span>potentially in the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Insolvency Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree </span><span>of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer of </span><span>securities held by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide </span><span>variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will </span><span>receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to </span><span>whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed, and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to </span><span>protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner </span><span>and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by a Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if </span><span>a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can </span><span>be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by a Fund in connection with such plan of reorganization or </span><span>restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be </span><span>unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, </span><span>disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. </span><span>Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the </span><span>outcome of each Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the </span><span>securities of the issuer held by a Fund could be re-characterized, or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, </span><span>including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock </span><span>(including convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock </span><span>purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. Equity securities are subject to changes in </span><span>value, and their value may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. Holders of equity securities are subject to more </span><span>risk than holders of debt securities because the status of equity holders is subordinate to debtholders in an issuer's capital </span><span>structure. The value of equity securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer </span><span>deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. </span><span>Equity securities received by a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not </span><span>be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent that a Fund receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial </span><span>restructuring, a Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets that </span><span>a Fund could receive is an interest in one or more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of </span><span>lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments </span><span>in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or </span><span>downward pricing pressure after completion of the reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring </span><span>assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If a Fund participates in negotiations with respect to a </span><span>plan of reorganization or restructuring with respect to securities of the issuer held by a Fund, each Fund also may be </span><span>restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If a Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund </span><span>may have more active participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered </span><span>Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The United </span><span>Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no </span><span>longer be published after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings and certain other interbank offered rates ceased to be </span><span>published after December 31, 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad measure of the cost of </span><span>borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used </span><span>increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory </span><span>fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR will replace LIBOR in different categories of financial </span><span>contracts after June 30, 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to </span><span>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </span><span>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </span><span>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </span><span>may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal Market Disruption Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal </span><span>market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities </span><span>holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on </span><span>municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before </span><span>state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, </span><span>the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Municipal Bond Fund’s holdings would be affected, and the Trustees </span><span>would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain </span><span>provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. Further, the </span><span>application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or among municipal securities </span><span>issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market generally, certain specific </span><span>segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular securities. Any of these effects could have a significant </span><span>impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Municipal Bond Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their </span><span>occurrence or effects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prepayment Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the </span><span>security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, </span><span>resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased </span><span>at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund) acquires a </span><span>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. </span><span>Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities </span><span>transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will </span><span>not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase </span><span>price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in </span><span>exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the security </span><span>declines, a Fund may lose money.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives. </span><span> </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and </span><span>tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in </span><span>derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk </span><span>that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of </span><span>leverage.</span></div> <div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </span><span>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </span><span>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </span><span>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging </span><span>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Furthermore, because, by definition, futures contracts project price levels in the future and not </span><span>current levels of valuation, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the bond index future and </span><span>the movement in the relevant Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be </span><span>required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it </span><span>may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In </span><span>addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered bond index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. Each Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk </span><span>of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. Each Fund, however, intends to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit its risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of bonds in which it </span><span>invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss </span><span>by a Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures </span><span>contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which </span><span>predictions could prove to be incorrect.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or </span><span>instrumentalities of foreign governments are generally backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities </span><span>issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign </span><span>government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, </span><span>unable or unwilling to actually provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the performance of </span><span>a Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by the foreign </span><span>government’s economic and other policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government may </span><span>cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. </span><span>During periods of economic uncertainty, the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S. agency investing include differences </span><span>in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries and cause restrictions on the flow of international </span><span>capital.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Non-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the </span><span>respective countries covered by a Fund. The risks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities typically include market fluctuations </span><span>caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in bond </span><span>prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and considerations not </span><span>typically associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include securities markets that may lack </span><span>sufficient liquidity or may be less efficient; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; </span><span>the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of a </span><span>Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing </span><span>contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of most non-U.S. securities markets; </span><span>different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial </span><span>government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the </span><span>risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and different bankruptcy and insolvency regimes which may stay or prevent </span><span>recovery in the event of an issuer’s default. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </span><span>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </span><span>its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </span><span>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s </span><span>rights as a creditor (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </span><span>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose </span><span>money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could </span><span>also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of </span><span>any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special Considerations Regarding Investments in California Municipal Securities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Following is a brief summary of some of the factors that may affect the financial condition of the State of California (referred </span><span>to herein as the </span><span>“</span><span>State</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>California</span><span>”</span><span>) and its political subdivisions. The summary is neither a complete nor a </span><span>comprehensive description of these factors nor an analysis of financial conditions and may not be indicative of the financial </span><span>condition of issuers of obligations or any particular projects financed with the proceeds of such obligations. Many factors not </span><span>included in the summary, such as the ongoing and evolving economic and health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic </span><span>on the State, local and national economies, the uncertain impact of federal and State financial assistance available to address </span><span>the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in federal policies related to trade, health care and immigration, social and </span><span>environmental policies and conditions, the national and international markets for products produced in California, </span><span>developments in municipal bankruptcies and significant unfunded pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities, </span><span>could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the State and its political subdivisions. The Fund is unable to </span><span>predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the municipal securities, the market </span><span>value or marketability of the municipal securities or the ability of the respective issuers of the municipal securities acquired by </span><span>the Fund to pay interest on or principal of the municipal securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests a high proportion of its assets in California municipal securities. The payment of interest on and </span><span>preservation of principal in these securities are dependent upon the continuing ability of California issuers and/or obligors of </span><span>State, municipal and public authority debt obligations to meet their obligations thereunder. In addition to general economic </span><span>pressures, certain California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders, administrative regulations </span><span>and voter initiatives could adversely affect a California issuer’s ability to raise revenues to meet its financial obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following summary is based upon the most recent publicly available State budget documents, specifically, the 2023-24</span><span> Governor’s Budget (defined below), which was released by the Governor of the State (the </span><span>“</span><span>Governor</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 10, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The achievement of </span><span>certain results or other expectations contained in such forward-looking statements involve known or unknown risks, </span><span>uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements attained to be materially </span><span>different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking </span><span>statements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Overview</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Budget Process</span><span>. The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. The annual State </span><span>budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year (the </span><span>“</span><span>Governor’s Budget</span><span>”</span><span>). The </span><span>Governor released his initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2023-24 on January 10, 2023 (the </span><span>“</span><span>2023-24 Governor’s Budget</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>State law also requires the Governor to update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals by May 14 of </span><span>each year. The Governor released his May Revision to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget on May 12, 2023 (the </span><span>“</span><span>May Revision</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>The Governor is required to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The Governor signed the fiscal year 2022-23</span><span> budget (the </span><span>“</span><span>2022-23 Budget</span><span>”</span><span>) on June 27, 2022. The LAO releases analysis of the Governor’s various budget proposals </span><span>throughout the year.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The May Revision projected total general fund beginning balance, revenues and transfers of $233.2 billion for fiscal year </span><span>2023-24 (an approximately 10.5% decrease over estimated results for fiscal year 2022-23), authorized expenditures of $224.1 </span><span>billion for fiscal year 2023-24 (an approximately 5.2% decrease from estimated results for fiscal year 2022-23), and projected </span><span>that the State will end the 2023-24 fiscal year with total available general fund reserves of $37.2 billion (an approximately </span><span>25.5% decrease from estimated results for fiscal year 2022-23). The May Revision estimated General Fund revenues </span><span>downward by $9.3 billion compared to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reported combined cash receipts for July 1, 2022 through March 30, 2023 were 3.7% ($4.7 billion) below the 2023-24 </span><span>Governor’s Budget forecast of $126.7 billion. Fiscal year-to-date shortfalls were due largely to lower personal income tax and </span><span>corporate tax receipts. Due to winter storms and flooding in January, certain payments were delayed and tax filing deadlines </span><span>for Californians in most counties were extended to May 15. These deadlines were further delayed to October 16, adding </span><span>significant uncertainty to the interpretation of cash results.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>COVID-19 Pandemic</span><span>-</span><span>General Impact</span><span>. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the State, like other state and local government </span><span>authorities, implemented, and revised from time to time, restrictions on mass gatherings that resulted in widespread closings </span><span>and modifications of the operations of government, businesses, universities and schools. The State and the State Treasury </span><span>General Fund (the </span><span>“</span><span>General Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), as well as local governments throughout the State, were initially adversely impacted by </span><span>the health-related and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted large sectors of the State economy </span><span>and remains a risk to the State’s finances as well as the finances of local governments. Disruptions were mitigated in part by </span><span>large federal funding programs to address the pandemic and its impacts. California has benefitted from approximately $603 </span><span>billion in federal assistance from direct payments to state and local governments and other assistance to individuals and </span><span>organizations. Some of such federal funding to state and local governments has yet to be expended. The 2022-23 Budget </span><span>projected federal funds to the State will decline $175 billion, or 55%, from $319 billion in 2021-22 to $144 billion in 2022-23. </span><span>This decline is the result of several significant federal programs enacted in response to COVID-19 expiring in 2022-23. Actual </span><span>and anticipated reimbursements from the federal government for costs associated with the State’s response to recent </span><span>wildfires and the pandemic are projected to total approximately $6.5 billion in the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget forecast, </span><span>compared to $13.4 billion in the 2022-23 Budget Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While it is impossible to describe in detail the impact on specific local bond issuances, the economic effects of the COVID-19 </span><span>pandemic will continue to affect or impair the credit quality of a variety of local California issuances. Many of the largest cities </span><span>in the State, including notably San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have experienced some of the highest office vacancy </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>rates in the Country. While the long term consequences of the pandemic are yet to be known, and will vary among </span><span>jurisdictions, these cities (among others) are projecting reduced local government property and other business related tax </span><span>revenue due to the reduced value of office properties, resulting in projected budget shortfalls.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The ability of local governments to address any budget shortfalls are constrained by constitutional limitations, included </span><span>limited taxing and borrowing powers and balanced budget requirements, among other factors. Unfunded pension and other </span><span>post-retirement liabilities also weigh heavily upon many local governments and have been the principal cause of several well-publicized</span><span> municipal bankruptcy filings.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Revenue Forecasts</span><span>. The long-term General Fund revenue forecast table below shows the State’s forecast for its main General </span><span>Fund revenue sources as of the May Revision for fiscal years 2021-22 through 2026-27. Total General Fund revenue from </span><span>these sources is projected to decline from $215.3 billion in 2021-22 to $204.8 billion in 2026-27. The State’s economic </span><span>outlook was modestly downgraded in the May Revision, due largely to actual economic data coming in slightly lower than </span><span>projected and tighter monetary conditions from more cautious lending in the banking sector. At the same time, tax receipts </span><span>continue to come in substantially lower than projected at the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget. Capital gains realizations are </span><span>assumed to decline from their record-high levels of 11.3% of personal income in 2021 to reach 5% of personal income by </span><span>2026. The May Revision forecasts that the General Fund faces an estimated budget shortfall of $31.5 billion in the 2023-24 </span><span>fiscal year.

As described herein, the State has a very progressive income tax structure with </span><span>the top one percent of taxpayers generally paying more than 40% of all personal income tax. This reliance on a progressive </span><span>income tax structure has resulted in more volatility in the State’s revenue base. See </span><span>“</span><span>Recent Financial Results.</span><span>”</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The May Revision revenue forecast is based on a scenario that assumes continued but slowing economic growth and does </span><span>not assume a recession. Several risk factors could negatively impact the economy and lead to a recession, which could either </span><span>be mild or more severe. A significant financial shock from tightening financial conditions, worsening of the recent banking </span><span>crisis, persistent supply chain issues, continued elevated inflation, further stock market and asset price declines, and </span><span>geopolitical turmoil are all issues that pose a risk to ongoing economic and revenue growth. The magnitude of the revenue </span><span>loss from a recession would depend upon the depth and duration of a recession, as well as its relative impact on higher-income</span><span> individuals. A mild recession could lead to General Fund revenue losses of over $20 billion relative to the State’s </span><span>forecasts for 2023-24.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The LAO estimates there is roughly two-thirds chance State revenues will come in below May Revision estimates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic Factors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>California is by far the most populous state in the nation; indeed, California is almost 33% larger than the second most-populous</span><span> state, according to the most recent population estimates released by the United States Census Bureau. California’s </span><span>population was an estimated 39.0 million as of January 1, 2022, down 0.4% from the previous year. Prior to the COVID-19 </span><span>pandemic, California’s population growth slowed due to declining births correlated with changes in education, marriage, and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>work decisions; rising deaths from an aging population; and reduced net migration due to recent decreases in foreign </span><span>immigration. The pandemic accelerated these trends and drove the State’s population growth negative in fiscal years 2020-21</span><span> and 2021-22. The combined effects of pandemic restrictions and federal administrative backlogs continue to keep </span><span>migration below pre-pandemic levels. Coupled with domestic out-migration, the slow rebound in international migration has </span><span>contributed to California’s recent population slow down. These trends are expected to continue as the population and labor </span><span>force adjust to pandemic-induced changes, while the larger domestic movements driven by employment shifts seem to have </span><span>subsided.</span></div> <div> <div><span>California’s economy, the largest among the 50 states, has major components in high technology, trade, entertainment, </span><span>manufacturing, tourism, construction and services. The relative proportion of the various components of the California </span><span>economy closely resembles the make-up of the national economy. California’s economy accounted for nearly 15% of the U.S. </span><span>GDP in calendar year 2021. California remained the fifth largest economy in the world in 2021, with a GDP of $3.4 trillion in </span><span>current dollars.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State reported in April 2023 that California’s median price for existing home sales reached a record high of $900,017 in </span><span>May 2023, just over a year after exceeding $800,000 for the first time. However, as interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage </span><span>rates, the demand for housing in the second half of 2022 began to fall and the median sale price for housing also fell, </span><span>reaching $751,330 in December 2022, a 16.5% decline from May. California residential housing units authorized by building </span><span>permits (seasonally adjusted) averaged approximately 120,000 through the first 10 months of 2022, the highest level since </span><span>2006. Multi-family units were up by 13.8% in 2021 relative to 2020, and single-family units were up by 11.6%.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Over the years, a number of constitutional amendments have been enacted, often through voter initiatives, that have </span><span>increased the difficulty of raising State taxes or restricted the use of General Fund revenues. Some of the most significant of </span><span>these approved constitutional amendments are described below. Because of the complex nature of these initiatives and the </span><span>ambiguities and possible inconsistencies in their terms, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on California </span><span>debt obligations or on the ability of the State or local governments to pay debt service on such California debt obligations. </span><span>Further initiatives or legislative changes in laws or the California Constitution may also affect the ability of the State or local </span><span>governments to repay their obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limitation on Property Taxes. </span><span>Certain California debt obligations may be obligations of local government issuers that rely in </span><span>whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on ad valorem property taxes as a source of revenue. The taxing powers of California </span><span>local governments are limited by Article XIIIA of the California Constitution (</span><span>“</span><span>Article XIIIA</span><span>”</span><span>), enacted by the voters in 1978 and </span><span>commonly known as </span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 13.</span><span>”</span><span> Briefly, Article XIIIA limits the rate of ad valorem property taxes to 1% of the full cash </span><span>value of real property and generally restricts the reassessment of property to 2% per year, except upon new construction or </span><span>change of ownership (subject to a number of exemptions). Local government taxing entities, however, may raise ad valorem </span><span>taxes above the 1% limit to pay debt service on voter-approved bonded indebtedness. See </span><span>“</span><span>Obligations of Other Issuers</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>herein.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under Article XIIIA, the basic 1% ad valorem tax levy is applied against the assessed value of property as of the owner’s date </span><span>of acquisition (or as of March 1, 1975, if acquired earlier), subject to certain adjustments. This system has resulted in widely </span><span>varying amounts of tax on similarly situated properties. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the acquisition-based </span><span>assessment system of Proposition 13, but it was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For further discussion on Proposition 13, see </span><span>“</span><span>Local Governments — Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local </span><span>Government</span><span>”</span><span> below. For further discussion on voter approval requirements under Article XIIIA, see </span><span>“</span><span>— Voter Requirements </span><span>for Taxes and Fees</span><span>”</span><span> below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges. </span><span>In 1996, the voters of the State approved Proposition 218, called the </span><span>“</span><span>Right </span><span>to Vote on Taxes Act.</span><span>”</span><span> Proposition 218 added Article XIIIC (</span><span>“</span><span>Article XIIIC</span><span>”</span><span>) and Article XIIID (</span><span>“</span><span>Article XIIID</span><span>”</span><span>) to the State </span><span>Constitution, each of which contains a number of provisions affecting the ability of local governments to levy and collect </span><span>both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Article XIIIC requires that all new or increased local taxes be submitted to the voters before they become effective. </span><span>Proposition 26, discussed below under the caption entitled </span><span>“</span><span>— Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees,</span><span>”</span><span> amended Article </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>XIIIC by adding an expansive definition of </span><span>“</span><span>taxes</span><span>”</span><span> to include many regulatory fees currently imposed by the State and its </span><span>municipalities. Taxes for general governmental purposes require a majority vote and taxes for specific purposes require a </span><span>two-thirds vote.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Article XIIID contains several provisions making it generally more difficult for local governments to levy and maintain </span><span>“</span><span>assessments</span><span>”</span><span> for municipal services and programs. Article XIIID also contains several provisions affecting </span><span>“</span><span>fees</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>charges,</span><span>”</span><span> defined for purposes of Article XIIID to mean </span><span>“</span><span>any levy other than an ad valorem tax, a special tax, or an </span><span>assessment, imposed by a local government upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including </span><span>a user fee or charge for a property related service.</span><span>”</span><span> All new and existing property-related fees and charges must conform to </span><span>requirements prohibiting, among other things, fees and charges that generate revenues exceeding the funds that are </span><span>required to provide the property-related service or are used for unrelated purposes. Article XIIID imposes notice, hearing and </span><span>protest procedures for levying or increasing property-related fees and charges, and, except for fees or charges for sewer, </span><span>water and refuse collection services (or fees for electrical and gas service, which are not treated as </span><span>“</span><span>property related</span><span>”</span><span> for </span><span>purposes of Article XIIID), no property-related fee or charge may be imposed or increased without majority approval by the </span><span>property owners subject to the fee or charge or, at the option of the local government, two-thirds voter approval by the </span><span>electorate residing in the affected area.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the provisions described above, Article XIIIC removes limitations on the initiative power in matters of local </span><span>taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Consequently, local voters, by future initiative, could repeal, reduce or prohibit the </span><span>future imposition or increase of any local tax, assessment, fee or charge. It is unclear how this right of local initiative may be </span><span>used in cases where taxes or charges have been or will be specifically pledged to secure debt issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limitations on the State’s Ability to Transfer Funds from Local Governments. </span><span>In 2010, voters in the State approved </span><span>Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative. Proposition 22, known as the </span><span>“</span><span>Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation </span><span>Protection Act of 2010,</span><span>”</span><span> eliminated or reduced the State’s authority to (i) temporarily shift property taxes from cities, </span><span>counties and special districts to schools, (ii) use vehicle license fee revenues to reimburse local governments for State-mandated</span><span> costs (i.e., the State will have to use other revenues to reimburse local governments), (iii) redirect property tax </span><span>increment from redevelopment agencies (which have since been dissolved, see </span><span>“</span><span>Obligations of Other Issuers — Tax </span><span>Increment and the Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies</span><span>”</span><span> below) to any other local government, (iv) use State fuel tax </span><span>revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, or (v) borrow or change the distribution of State fuel tax </span><span>revenues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees.</span><span> Proposition 26, known as the </span><span>“</span><span>Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees Act</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>was approved by State voters in 2010. Proposition 26 amended provisions of Article XIIIA and Article XIIIC governing the </span><span>imposition of taxes. Proposition 26 requires a two-thirds supermajority vote in the California State Legislature (the </span><span>“</span><span>State </span><span>Legislature</span><span>”</span><span>) prior to the imposition of any change in State statute that results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax. This </span><span>requirement eliminated the prior practice that allowed, via majority vote, one tax to be increased if another tax is lowered by </span><span>an equivalent amount. Furthermore, any increase in a fee beyond the amount needed to provide the specific service or </span><span>benefit is deemed a </span><span>“</span><span>tax</span><span>”</span><span> and thus would require two-thirds vote of any governmental units for passage. As noted, </span><span>Proposition 26 requires taxes for general governmental purposes to be approved by a majority vote and taxes for specific </span><span>purposes to be approved by a two-thirds vote. Proposition 26 applied retroactively to any measures passed on or after </span><span>January 1, 2010.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Appropriations Limits. </span><span>The State and its local governments are subject to an annual </span><span>“</span><span>appropriations limit</span><span>”</span><span> imposed by </span><span>Article XIIIB of the California Constitution (</span><span>“</span><span>Article XIIIB</span><span>”</span><span>), enacted by the voters in 1979 and significantly amended by </span><span>Propositions 98 and 111 in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Article XIIIB prohibits the State or any covered local government from </span><span>spending </span><span>“</span><span>appropriations subject to limitation</span><span>”</span><span> in excess of the appropriations limit imposed. </span><span>“</span><span>Appropriations subject to </span><span>limitation</span><span>”</span><span> are authorizations to spend </span><span>“</span><span>proceeds of taxes,</span><span>”</span><span> which consist of tax revenues and certain other funds, including </span><span>proceeds from regulatory licenses, user charges or other fees, to the extent that such proceeds exceed the cost of providing </span><span>the product or service, but </span><span>“</span><span>proceeds of taxes</span><span>”</span><span> exclude most State subventions to local governments. No limit is imposed on </span><span>appropriations of funds that are not </span><span>“</span><span>proceeds of taxes,</span><span>”</span><span> such as reasonable user charges or fees and certain other non-tax </span><span>funds, including bond proceeds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Among the expenditures not included in the Article XIIIB appropriations limit are (i) the debt service cost of bonds issued or </span><span>authorized prior to January 1, 1979, or subsequently authorized by the voters, (ii) appropriations to comply with mandates of </span><span>courts or the federal government, (iii) appropriations for certain capital outlay projects, (iv) appropriations for tax refunds, (v) </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>appropriations by the State of post-1989 increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle weight fees, (vi) appropriation of certain </span><span>special taxes imposed by initiative (e.g., cigarette and tobacco taxes) and (vii) appropriations made in certain cases of </span><span>emergency.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The appropriations limit for each year is adjusted annually to reflect changes in cost of living and population and any </span><span>transfers of service responsibilities between government units. </span><span>“</span><span>Excess</span><span>”</span><span> revenues are measured over a two-year cycle. Local </span><span>governments must return any excess to taxpayers by rate reductions. The State must refund 50% of any excess to taxpayers, </span><span>with the other 50% paid to schools and community colleges. With more liberal annual adjustment factors since 1988, few </span><span>local governments have been operating near their spending limits, but this condition may change over time. Local </span><span>governments may by majority voter approval exceed their spending limits for up to four years.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State has rarely exceeded its appropriations limit. In recent years, however, State appropriations have trended closer to </span><span>the limit. Strong revenue growth, coupled with more moderate growth in the appropriations limit, served to reduce the room </span><span>under the limit. Two of the three growth factors, the change in civilian population and the change in K-14 average daily </span><span>attendance, have dropped to less than 1% and have been negative, respectively, in a number of recent years. The 2023-24 </span><span>Budget estimates that the State will remain under the limit through fiscal year 2023-24.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools.</span><span> The single largest portion of the State budget is support for K-14 schools. </span><span>In 1988, the voters of the State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which </span><span>(subject to suspension by a two-thirds vote of the State Legislature and the Governor) guarantees local school districts and </span><span>community college districts a minimum share of General Fund revenues (the </span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 98 Guarantee</span><span>”</span><span>) with the balance </span><span>of school funding provided by a share of local property taxes. Proposition 98 is extremely complex and results in significant </span><span>fiscal problems when General Fund revenues fall short of the projections on which the original appropriations to schools </span><span>were made. For further discussion regarding Proposition 98, see </span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding</span><span>”</span><span> below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Obligations of the State</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State has always paid when due the principal of and interest on its general obligation bonds, general obligation </span><span>commercial paper notes, lease revenue obligations and short-term obligations, including revenue anticipation notes and </span><span>revenue anticipation warrants. The State Constitution prohibits the creation of general obligation indebtedness of the State </span><span>unless a bond measure is approved by a majority of the electorate voting at a general election or a direct primary.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital Facilities Financing.</span><span> The State builds and acquires capital facilities primarily through the use of general obligation </span><span>bonds and lease-purchase borrowing. Under the State Constitution, debt service on outstanding general obligation bonds is </span><span>the second charge to the General Fund after support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. </span><span>New general obligation bonds, lease revenue bonds and other General Fund-supported debt are authorized by the voters </span><span>and/or the State Legislature with lease revenue bonds generally authorized by the State Legislature. As of March 1, 2023, the </span><span>State had approximately $69.7 billion of outstanding general obligation bonds payable principally from the State’s General </span><span>Fund and approximately $27.2 billion of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported general obligation bonds. As of </span><span>March 1, 2023, the State had approximately $8.0 billion in outstanding lease revenue bonds payable from lease payments </span><span>paid from the operating budget of the respective lessees, the operating budgets of which are primarily, but not exclusively, </span><span>derived from the General Fund. As of July 1, 2022, the State had $5.7 billion of authorized but unissued lease revenue bonds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of April 2023, debt service on General Fund-supported general obligation bonds and lease revenue debt was estimated to </span><span>equal approximately 3.66% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2022-23 and 3.69% of General Fund revenues in fiscal </span><span>year 2023-24. This debt service cost is calculated based on the amount of debt service to be paid without adjusting for </span><span>reimbursement from various special funds and subsidy payments from the federal government for taxable </span><span>“</span><span>Build America </span><span>Bonds.</span><span>”</span><span> Including those projected offsets would reduce debt service on General Fund-supported general obligation bonds </span><span>and lease revenue debt to approximately 2.86% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2022-23 and 2.85% in fiscal year </span><span>2023-24. The actual General Fund debt ratio in future fiscal years will depend on a variety of factors, including actual debt </span><span>issuance (which may include additional issuance approved in the future by the State Legislature and, for general obligation </span><span>bonds, the voters), actual interest rates, debt service structure, and actual General Fund revenues and transfers.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Future Bond Issuance Plans.</span><span> The amount of outstanding General Fund-supported debt, primarily general obligation bonds, </span><span>may increase in coming years given the amount of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported bonds the State can </span><span>issue. See </span><span>“</span><span>— Capital Facilities Financing</span><span>”</span><span> above. Based on estimates from the Department of Finance in April 2023, </span><span>approximately $4.3 billion of new money general obligation bonds (some of which may initially be in the form of commercial </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>paper notes) and approximately $65 million in lease revenue bonds are expected to be issued through the end of fiscal year </span><span>2022-23. In fiscal year 2023-24, the Department of Finance estimates issuance of approximately $5.9 billion of new money </span><span>general obligation bonds (some of which may initially be in the form of commercial paper notes) and approximately $1.5 </span><span>billion in new money lease revenue bonds. However, the exact amount that may be issued will depend on overall budget </span><span>constraints, market conditions and other factors including updated information provided to the Department of Finance by </span><span>other departments in the State regarding funding needs and actual spending. The State also issues refunding bonds as </span><span>market conditions warrant.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Cash Management. </span><span>As part of its cash management program, prior to fiscal year 2015-16, the State has regularly issued </span><span>short-term obligations to meet cash flow needs. External borrowing were typically done with revenue anticipation notes that </span><span>are payable later in the fiscal year in which they are issued. In April 2023, the State observed that, based on then current cash </span><span>projections, the State is not expected to issue revenue anticipation notes through fiscal year 2023-24. In the 2022-23 Budget, </span><span>the State assumed a cash cushion of unused internal borrowable resources of at least $33 billion at the end of each month </span><span>through the end of fiscal year 2022-23.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State is also authorized under certain circumstances to issue revenue anticipation warrants that are payable in the </span><span>succeeding fiscal year, as well as registered refunding warrants issued to refund revenue anticipation warrants. The State has </span><span>issued revenue anticipation warrants to bridge short-term cash flow shortages in five years since 1992. From time to time, </span><span>the State Legislature has deferred various payments due under State statute in order to more closely align the State’s </span><span>revenues with its expenditures. This technique has been used in past budgets in order to reduce the State’s need for external </span><span>borrowing to bridge any cash flow deficit. Further, State law gives the State Controller some flexibility to delay payments to </span><span>various payees, including State vendors, when the State Controller foresees a relatively short-term cash flow shortage. In </span><span>addition, the State issued IOUs in lieu of cash payments in July and August 2009, the second such issuance since the 1930s.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Obligations of State Agencies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A number of State agencies and authorities issue obligations secured or payable from specified revenue streams. These </span><span>obligations are not payable from the General Fund and carry different ratings than the State’s general obligation bonds. None </span><span>of these revenue bonds are backed by the State’s faith and credit or taxing power. As of December 31, 2022, the various State </span><span>revenue bond financing programs had approximately $44.4 billion in outstanding bonds, and the various State financing </span><span>authorities had approximately $34.2 billion of outstanding revenue bonds. The Regents of the University of California has </span><span>been one of the largest issuers of revenue bonds in recent years, with approximately $28.3 billion of outstanding revenue </span><span>bonds secured by certain revenues of the University of California as of December 31, 2022. Other State agencies and </span><span>authorities with significant bond programs include the California State University system, with approximately $8.6 billion of </span><span>outstanding revenue bonds secured by certain revenues of the California State University; the State Department of Water </span><span>Resources, which had approximately $2.9 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by power and water users; the </span><span>California Health Facilities Financing Authority, which had $15.3 billion in outstanding revenue bonds secured primarily by </span><span>revenues of various health facilities; and the California Education Facilities Authority, which had approximately $4.1 billion of </span><span>outstanding revenue bonds secured primarily by revenues of various educational facilities, as of December 31, 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Recent Financial Results</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Historically, the principal sources of General Fund revenues are personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporation tax. </span><span>The May Revision projected that personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporation tax will contribute 56.5%, 16.0% </span><span>and 20.1%, respectively, of total General Fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year 2023-24, for a cumulative estimated total </span><span>of 92.6% of General Fund revenues, with not transfer to the Budget Stabilization Account.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State’s personal income tax structure is highly progressive, with rates ranging from 1% to 12.3%. For example, for the </span><span>2020 tax year, the State reported that the top one percent of income earners paid over 49% of personal income taxes. This </span><span>percentage has been greater than 40% in every year since 2004, except for 2009. The personal income tax was made even </span><span>more progressive with the passage of Proposition 30 (defined below), which imposed additional taxes on earnings over </span><span>$250,000, resulting in an income tax rate of 12.3% on earnings over $1 million.

Year-end balances in the SFEU are included for financial reporting purposes in the General Fund </span><span>balance. The May Revision projected a balance in the SFEU of $3.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2023-24. However, the </span><span>amount in the SFEU at the end of any particular fiscal year may differ materially from the amount projected at the time the </span><span>related Budget for that fiscal year was adopted.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Throughout the 1980s, State spending increased rapidly as the State population and economy also grew rapidly. Such </span><span>spending included increased spending for many assistance programs to local governments, which were constrained by </span><span>Proposition 13 and other laws. The largest State assistance program is to local public school districts. In 1988, the voters of </span><span>the State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which provides for the </span><span>Proposition 98 Guarantee. The Proposition 98 Guarantee is calculated each fiscal year using one of three tests that apply </span><span>under varying fiscal and economic conditions. Test 1 earmarks a minimum portion of State revenue for K-14 education, and </span><span>Test 2 and Test 3 are based on prior-year Proposition 98 funding adjusted for key factors including changes in student </span><span>enrollment, as measured by K-12 average daily attendance. Test 2 further adjusts for the change in inflation. The test that </span><span>provides the highest level of funding applies. Test 2 and Test 3 are generally used in times of economic distress although the </span><span>State also has the ability to suspend the Proposition 98 funding mechanism.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The May Revision projected that the Proposition 98 Guarantee for fiscal year 2023-24 will be $106.8 billion. For further </span><span>information on the limitations on General Fund revenues imposed by Proposition 98, see </span><span>“</span><span>Constitutional Limitations on </span><span>Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State. </span><span>The financial condition of the State and its localities is also subject to pension and other post-retirement benefit risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pension.</span><span> The pension funds managed by the State’s retirement systems, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>CalPERS</span><span>”</span><span>) and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (</span><span>“</span><span>CalSTRS</span><span>”</span><span>), each have unfunded liabilities in the tens of </span><span>billions of dollars. These unfunded liabilities will require increased contributions from the General Fund in future years. The </span><span>2023-24 Governor’s Budget estimated a $4.7 billion General Fund contribution for the statutorily required annual State </span><span>contribution to CalPERS for State pension costs based on the CalPERS actuarial valuation projected contribution rates as of </span><span>June 30, 2021. This is $151 million higher than the 2022-23 Budget General Fund contribution due to payroll growth and the </span><span>normal progression of amortization bases, including the 7.4% investment loss in 2021-22. Included in these costs are $747 </span><span>million General Fund for California State University retirement costs. Additionally, the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget includes </span><span>$1.2 billion one-time Proposition 2 debt repayment funding as a supplemental payment toward the state plans’ unfunded </span><span>liabilities. The May Revision estimates $1.7 billion in one-time Proposition 2 debt repayment funding in 2023-24 and a net </span><span>total decreased of $1.7 billion in 2023-24 contributions to CalPERS relative to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The 2023-24 Governor’s Budget estimates a $3.9 billion General Fund contribution for the statutorily required annual State </span><span>contribution to CalSTRS. The roughly $218 million increase from the 2022-23 Budget is due to higher-than-anticipated </span><span>growth in creditable compensation from 2020-21 to 2021-22. In the May Revision, State General Fund contributions to </span><span>CalSTRS increased by $8.8 million in 2023-24, relative to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget, due to a revision in reported </span><span>compensation for K-12 and community college teachers.

All three of these cities </span><span>have agreements with CalPERS to administer their pension obligations, and their respective obligations to CalPERS were a </span><span>significant reason for their insolvency. Other cities (including some that contract with CalPERS) and counties have expressed </span><span>public concerns about their ability to meet their unfunded pension and other post-retirement liabilities, and a willingness to </span><span>entertain bankruptcy as an option to resolve their fiscal problems. One federal bankruptcy judge stated that obligations to </span><span>CalPERS could be adjusted in federal bankruptcy proceedings; however, the plan of adjustment in those proceedings was </span><span>confirmed without reducing such obligations to CalPERS. Any definitive ruling that allowed obligations to CalPERS to be </span><span>adjusted downward might encourage other financially stressed municipalities to explore a Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The fiscal </span><span>stress and cash pressures facing the State’s localities prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be exacerbated as a result of the </span><span>pandemic for certain local governments depending on the makeup of their economy or revenue sources as well as the overall </span><span>makeup of their outstanding debt. See </span><span>“</span><span>Obligations of Other Issuers.</span><span>”</span></div> <div> <div><span>School districts in the State are required to make contributions to CalSTRS for their teachers and staff.

The State and its localities that participate in pension and other post-employment benefit programs could face </span><span>increasing contribution rates if related pension or OPEB investment funds experience declining rates of return, plan </span><span>assumptions change or actual experience departs from assumptions. Future increases in pension fund and post-retirement </span><span>benefit contributions could reduce discretionary funds available for other governmental programs. In addition, the credit </span><span>ratings of the State or locality may be adversely affected if the State or locality does not reduce or manage its unfunded </span><span>liabilities. See </span><span>“</span><span>Bond Ratings</span><span>”</span><span> below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Law Regarding Pensions and Pension Reform. </span><span>California courts have been largely supportive of the vested or earned </span><span>pension rights of State and local employees. Thus, pension reform efforts have been focused largely on limitations on future </span><span>benefits for new employees, bringing limited, if any, immediate financial relief. In September 2012, the Governor signed into </span><span>law a comprehensive pension reform package affecting State and local governments known as the California Public </span><span>Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (</span><span>“</span><span>PEPRA</span><span>”</span><span>), which became effective January 1, 2013. PEPRA implements lower </span><span>defined-benefit formulas with higher retirement ages for new State employees hired on or after January 1, 2013, and includes </span><span>provisions to increase employee contributions. Both constitutional initiatives and other State legislation have been circulated </span><span>or proposed attempting to reform the State’s pension systems on a State and local basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State Budget</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Overview</span><span>. </span><span>The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. The annual budget is proposed </span><span>by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year. Under State law, the Governor’s Budget cannot provide for </span><span>projected expenditures in excess of projected revenues for the ensuing fiscal year. State law also requires the Governor to </span><span>update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals in the May Revision by May 14 of each year. The May </span><span>Revision is generally the basis for final negotiations between the Governor and the State Legislature to reach agreement on </span><span>appropriations and other legislation to fund State government and thus finalize the State Budget for the upcoming fiscal year. </span><span>The budget must be balanced, as required by Proposition 58 (discussed below). The budget must be approved by a majority </span><span>of each house of the State Legislature. State law requires the Governor to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July </span><span>1. See </span><span>“</span><span>Status of State General Fund; the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget</span><span>”</span><span> below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Constraints on the Budget Process. </span><span>Recent State constitutional amendments approved by State voters have affected the </span><span>budget process. Several such amendments are described below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition 2).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proposition 58</span><span>.</span><span> In 2004, voters approved Proposition 58, a constitutional amendment called the </span><span>“</span><span>Balanced Budget </span><span>Amendment,</span><span>”</span><span> which requires the State to enact a balanced budget and establish a special reserve and restricts future </span><span>borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits. As a result of the provisions requiring the enactment of a balanced budget and </span><span>restricting borrowing, the State would in some cases have to take more immediate actions to correct budgetary shortfalls. </span><span>Proposition 58 requires the State Legislature to pass a balanced budget and provides for mid-year adjustments in the event </span><span>that the budget falls out of balance and the Governor calls a special legislative session to address the shortfall. The balanced </span><span>budget determination is made by subtracting expenditures from all available resources, including prior-year balances.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under Proposition 58, if the Governor determines that the State is facing substantial revenue shortfalls or spending increases, </span><span>the Governor is authorized to declare a fiscal emergency. The Governor would then be required to propose legislation to </span><span>address the emergency and call the State Legislature into special session for that purpose. If the State Legislature fails to pass </span><span>and send to the Governor legislation to address the fiscal emergency within 45 days, the State Legislature would be </span><span>prohibited from acting on any other bills or adjourning in joint recess until such legislation is passed. No fiscal emergency has </span><span>been declared as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The BSA is a special reserve account funded by annual transfers of specified amounts from the General Fund, unless </span><span>suspended or reduced by the Governor or until a specified maximum amount has been deposited. Until the 2014-15 Budget, </span><span>the Governor had suspended the annual transfer of money from the General Fund to the BSA every year since 2007. </span><span>Proposition 2 intended to strengthen the BSA by, among other things, basing deposits on when capital gains revenues rise </span><span>above 8%, creating a Proposition 98 reserve and doubling the maximum size of the BSA from 5% to 10% of General Fund </span><span>revenues. Funding for the BSA is estimated by May Revision to be approximately $22.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and </span><span>approximately $22.3 billion as of June 30, 2024. Certain other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were replaced </span><span>by the provisions of Proposition 2. See </span><span>“</span><span>—Proposition 2</span><span>”</span><span> below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proposition 58 also prohibits certain future borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits. This restriction applies to general </span><span>obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and certain other forms of long-term borrowing. The restriction does not apply to certain </span><span>other types of borrowing, such as short-term borrowing to cover cash shortfalls in the General Fund (including revenue </span><span>anticipation notes or revenue anticipation warrants currently used by the State), or inter-fund borrowings. See </span><span>“</span><span>Cash </span><span>Management</span><span>”</span><span> above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proposition 2</span><span>. In addition to the provisions described above, other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were </span><span>replaced by the provisions of Proposition 2 (</span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 2</span><span>”</span><span>). Proposition 2 requires that 1.5% of annual General Fund </span><span>revenues be deposited each year into the BSA until the BSA balance reaches an amount equal to 10% of General Fund </span><span>revenues. Proposition 2 also requires that half of the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA </span><span>through fiscal year 2030-31 be used for supplemental payments to pay down long-term liabilities. After fiscal year 2030-31, </span><span>the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA may be used for either supplemental debt payments or </span><span>savings. Proposition 2 further requires that withdrawal of funds from the BSA be only for a disaster or if spending remains at </span><span>or below the highest level of spending from the prior three years. Proposition 2 limits the maximum amount that could be </span><span>withdrawn in the first year of a recession to half of the BSA’s balance. It also requires the State to provide a multiyear budget </span><span>forecast to help better manage the State’s longer-term finances and to create a Proposition 98 reserve, whereby spikes in </span><span>funding are to be saved for future years to smooth school spending and minimize future cuts.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State-Local Fiscal Relations</span><span>. The enactment of Proposition 1A in November 2004 (</span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 1A of 2004</span><span>”</span><span>) and Proposition </span><span>22, or the </span><span>“</span><span>Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation Protection Act of 2010</span><span>”</span><span>, in November 2010 (</span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 22</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>significantly changed the fiscal relationship between the State and local governments by severely limiting the State’s access </span><span>to local funding sources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Specifically, Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to, among other things, reduce the State’s access to </span><span>property tax, sales tax and vehicle license fee revenues raised by local governments. Proposition 1A of 2004 also prohibits the </span><span>State from mandating activities on cities, counties or special districts without providing funding to comply with the </span><span>mandates. If the State does not provide funding for the mandated activity, the requirement to abide by the mandate is </span><span>suspended.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, Proposition 22 prohibits the State Legislature from, among other things, (i) taking or reallocating money raised </span><span>by local governments for local purposes, (ii) making changes in the allocation of property taxes among local governments </span><span>designed to aid State finances, (iii) using State fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, (iv) </span><span>borrowing or changing the distribution of State fuel tax revenues, and (v) using vehicle licensing fee revenues to reimburse </span><span>local governments for State-mandated costs. The inability of the State to borrow or redirect funds from these sources, as it </span><span>did during the Great Recession in fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10, will reduce the State’s flexibility in reaching budget </span><span>solutions in the future. On the other hand, both Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 made the allocation of revenues </span><span>to local jurisdictions more predictable.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proposition 30 and Proposition 55</span><span>. In 2012, voters approved </span><span>“</span><span>The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 30</span><span>”</span><span>), which provided temporary increases in personal income tax rates for high-income taxpayers and a </span><span>temporary increase in the State’s sales tax rate. The sales tax portion of Proposition 30 expired on December 31, 2016. In </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The 2022-23 Budget projected the revenue from these additional tax brackets to be </span><span>$13.8 billion in fiscal year 2020-21, $14.9 billion in fiscal year 2021-22, and $14.3 billion in fiscal year 2022-23.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Health Care Services. </span><span>Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, is a health care entitlement program for qualified low-income </span><span>individuals and families who receive public assistance or otherwise lack health care coverage and is one of the State’s largest </span><span>expenditures. Medi-Cal is projected to cover approximately 15.2 million Californians in 2022-23 and 14.4 million in 2023-24—</span><span>more than one-third of the state’s population.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The 2022-23 Budget proposed to expand Medi-Cal coverage to income eligible adults aged 26 through 49, regardless of </span><span>immigration status, no sooner than January 1, 2024. Medi-Cal currently covers undocumented persons under the age of 26.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the May Revision, the Medi-Cal budget includes $135.4 billion ($30.9 billion General Fund) in 2022-23 and $151.2 billion </span><span>($37.6 billion General Fund) in 2023-24. The General Fund components represent, respectively, approximately 13.1% of </span><span>estimated total 2022-23 General Fund expenditures and 16.8% of estimated total 2023-24 General Fund expenditures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The overall Medi-Cal budget may significantly change over time, including within a single fiscal year, due to its size, financial </span><span>complexity, federal requirements, and the fact that Medi-Cal operates on a cash, rather than an accrual, basis of accounting, </span><span>which means that the timing of transactions can significantly disrupt fiscal year budgetary estimates. In addition, the federal </span><span>administration and leaders in Congress continue to consider and propose numerous changes to health and human services </span><span>programs. Many of the proposals could have far-reaching impacts on health care in California and significant impacts to </span><span>Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The net impact of health care costs on the General Fund continues to depend on a variety of factors, including federal </span><span>legislation or interpretations of existing federal law or regulations, levels of individual and employer participation, changes in </span><span>insurance premiums, and the approval or enactment of solutions by the State to address health care costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Status of State General Fund; the May Revision of the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The May Revision projected total general fund beginning balance, revenues and transfers of $233.2 billion for fiscal year </span><span>2023-24, authorized expenditures of $224.1 billion for fiscal year 2023-24, and projected that the State will end the 2023-24 </span><span>fiscal year with total available general fund reserves of $37.2 billion, including $3.8 billion in the SFEU, $22.3 billion in the BSA, </span><span>$450 million in the Safety Net Reserve Fund and $10.7 billion in the Public School System Stabilization Account.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>None of the information on the above websites is incorporated herein by reference.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Local Governments</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General.</span><span> The primary units of local government in California are the 58 counties, which range in population from less than </span><span>1,200 in Alpine County to over 10 million in Los Angeles County.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Counties are responsible for the provision of many basic services, including indigent health care, welfare, jails, and public </span><span>safety in unincorporated areas. As of April 2023, there were 482 incorporated cities in California and thousands of special </span><span>districts formed to provide various services. Commencing with the 2011-12 Budget, the State implemented a realignment </span><span>plan to shift certain State program costs to counties and provided a comparable amount of funds to support these new </span><span>county commitments. Under the realignment plan, ongoing funds for such programs are required to be provided to counties </span><span>for court security, corrections and public safety, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, child welfare programs, </span><span>adult protective services, and CalWORKs. However, State transfers (approximately $10 billion in fiscal year 2022-23) do not </span><span>cover all the costs of such programs. Consequently, local governments, particularly counties, have borne an increased part of </span><span>the financial burden of providing program services, including the risks of cost overruns, revenue declines and insufficient </span><span>revenue growth.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the State is constrained by its obligation to schools under Proposition 98 or other fiscal considerations, the </span><span>absolute level (or the rate of growth) of State assistance to local governments may be affected. Any such reductions in State </span><span>aid could compound the serious fiscal constraints already experienced by many local governments, particularly counties and </span><span>schools. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of funding that the State is required to provide to schools under </span><span>Proposition 98 was temporarily reduced but now exceeds pre-COVID-19 funding levels. See </span><span>“</span><span>Proposition 98 and K-14 </span><span>Funding.</span><span>”</span><span> Schools have also faced increased costs related to physical plant and staffing costs associated with social </span><span>distancing protocols. School districts generally maintain some level of operating reserves; however, for certain school districts </span><span>this may not be sufficient to address any drop in revenue available to schools due to reductions in the Proposition 98 </span><span>Guarantee, other revenue losses and increased costs associated with responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. See </span><span>“</span><span>Proposition </span><span>98 and K-14 Funding</span><span>”</span><span> above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While it is impossible to describe in detail the impact on specific local bond issuances, the economic effects of the COVID-19 </span><span>pandemic will continue to affect or impair the credit quality of a variety of local California issuances. Many of the largest cities </span><span>in the State, including notably San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have experienced some of the highest office vacancy </span><span>rates in the Country. While the long term consequences of the pandemic are yet to be known, and will vary among </span><span>jurisdictions, these cities (among others) are projecting reduced local government property and other business related tax </span><span>revenue due to the reduced value of office properties, resulting in projected budget shortfalls.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, local governments that are experiencing declining revenues and increased expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic </span><span>or other local factors are limited in their ability to levy and raise property taxes and other forms of taxes, fees or assessments, </span><span>due to State constitutional as well as (in some cases) local initiatives. Local governments are also constrained by balanced </span><span>budget requirements and prohibitions on long-term borrowing for operating costs. As a consequence of these factors, local </span><span>governments may increasingly be forced to cut local services to address budget shortfalls or to take even more drastic </span><span>actions, such as a bankruptcy filing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many local governments are also facing substantial increases in pension liabilities and health care costs for retirees. Any </span><span>declines in the U.S. and global stock markets could have a material impact on the investments in the State pension trusts, </span><span>which could materially increase the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for CalPERS and CalSTRS, which, in turn, could result </span><span>in material changes to required contribution rates for local governments in future fiscal years. In the case of school districts, </span><span>contributions to CalSTRS are determined by the State Legislature, and the State had previously enacted legislation to increase </span><span>required contributions to pay rising pension costs. However, to the extent such required contributions exceed available </span><span>funding, local government finances will continue to be adversely affected. For more information regarding pension liabilities, </span><span>see </span><span>“</span><span>State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities</span><span>”</span><span> above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local Government.</span><span> The fiscal condition of local governments was changed </span><span>when Proposition 13, which added Article XIIIA to the State Constitution, was approved by California voters in 1978. </span><span>Proposition 13 reduced and limited the future growth of property taxes and limited the ability of local governments to impose </span><span>“</span><span>special taxes</span><span>”</span><span> (i.e., those devoted to a specific purpose) without two-thirds voter approval. Although Proposition 13 limited </span><span>property tax growth rates, it also has had a smoothing effect on property tax revenues, ensuring greater stability in annual </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>39</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>revenues than existed before Proposition 13 passed. For further information on Proposition 13, see </span><span>“</span><span>Constitutional </span><span>Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Limitation on Property Taxes</span><span>”</span><span> above.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Proposition 218, a constitutional amendment enacted by initiative in 1996, further limited the ability of local governments to </span><span>raise taxes, fees, and other exactions. See </span><span>“</span><span>Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General </span><span>Fund Revenues — Limitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges</span><span>”</span><span> above. Proposition 62, a statutory initiative adopted by the </span><span>voters in 1986, includes limitations on the ability of local governments to raise taxes that are similar to those included in the </span><span>later constitutional amendments of Proposition 218.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the aftermath of Proposition 13, the State provided aid to local governments from the General Fund to make up some of </span><span>the loss of property tax moneys, including assuming principal responsibility for funding K-12 schools and community </span><span>colleges. During the recession of the early 1990s, the State Legislature reduced the post-Proposition 13 aid to local </span><span>government entities other than K-12 schools and community colleges by requiring cities and counties to transfer some of </span><span>their property tax revenues to school districts. However, the State Legislature also provided additional funding sources, such </span><span>as sales taxes, and reduced certain mandates for local services funded by cities and counties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beginning in 2000, and in part caused by the </span><span>“</span><span>internet bubble,</span><span>”</span><span> the State was faced with increasing financial stress and </span><span>began to divert local revenue resources, including sales tax, vehicle license fees and redevelopment moneys, to the State </span><span>coffers. The 2004-05 Budget, related legislation and the enactment of Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 </span><span>dramatically changed the State-local fiscal relationship. Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to, among </span><span>other things, reduce the State Legislature’s authority over local government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the </span><span>State’s access to local governments’ property, sales, and vehicle license fee revenues as of November 3, 2004. Proposition 22, </span><span>which supersedes Proposition 1A of 2004, completely prohibits any future borrowing by the State from local government </span><span>funds and generally prohibits the State Legislature from making changes in local government funding sources. For further </span><span>discussion regarding Proposition 22 and Proposition 1A of 2004, see </span><span>“</span><span>The State Budget — Balanced Budget Amendment </span><span>(Proposition 58 and Proposition 2) — State-Local Fiscal Relations</span><span>”</span><span> above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Obligations of Other Issuers</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Issuers of California Debt Obligations.</span><span> There are a number of State agencies, instrumentalities and political </span><span>subdivisions of the State that issue municipal obligations, some of which may be conduit revenue obligations payable from </span><span>payments from private borrowers. These entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties, and the credit </span><span>quality of the securities issued by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full faith </span><span>and credit of the State. See </span><span>“</span><span>Local Governments — General</span><span>”</span><span> above. For example, assessment bonds may be adversely </span><span>affected by a general decline in real estate values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>California Long-Term Lease Obligations.</span><span> Based on a series of court decisions, certain long-term lease obligations, though </span><span>typically payable from the General Fund or a municipality, are not considered </span><span>“</span><span>indebtedness</span><span>”</span><span> requiring voter approval. Such </span><span>leases, however, are subject to </span><span>“</span><span>abatement</span><span>”</span><span> in the event the facility being leased is unavailable for beneficial use and </span><span>occupancy by the municipality during the term of the lease. Abatement is not a default, and there may be no remedies </span><span>available to the holders of the certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event abatement occurs. The most common </span><span>cases of abatement are failure to complete construction of the facility before the end of the period during which lease </span><span>payments have been capitalized and uninsured casualty losses to the facility (e.g., due to earthquake). In the event abatement </span><span>occurs with respect to a lease obligation, lease payments may be interrupted (if all available insurance proceeds and reserves </span><span>are exhausted) and the certificates may not be paid when due. Further, lease obligations may represent executory contracts </span><span>that could be rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In recent </span><span>bankruptcy proceedings involving the City of Stockton, the confirmed plan of adjustment included the discharge of lease </span><span>obligations at significant discounts from their face value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Statutory Lien Securing General Obligation Bonds. </span><span>Certain local governments, particularly school districts, issue general </span><span>obligation bonds secured by ad valorem property taxes. Effective January 1, 2016, provisions were added to the California </span><span>Education Code and the California Government Code to provide that general obligation bonds issued and sold by local </span><span>governments in California are secured by a statutory lien on the ad valorem property taxes levied and collected to pay the </span><span>principal and interest on such general obligation bonds. A statutory lien provides bondholders with a security interest in ad </span><span>valorem property taxes intended to survive a bankruptcy of the local government. It is unclear whether these provisions apply </span><span>to bonds issued prior to the effective date.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>40</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Factors</span></div> <div> <div><span>Inflation and Recession.</span><span> Inflation in the State is historically above the nation’s inflation levels due to the State’s faster </span><span>increases in energy prices and continued housing pressures. After slowing from 3% in 2019 to 1.7% in 2020, California </span><span>inflation accelerated to 4.2% in 2021, and averaged around 7.5% in 2022. Elevated inflation in 2021 was driven by pent-up </span><span>demand after suppression of economic activity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example prices of gasoline, air </span><span>travel, and hotels skyrocketed and supply chain disruptions and various shortages have driven up the prices of durable </span><span>goods. In 2022, inflation became more broad-based, spreading to food, shelter and other components, and the year over year </span><span>California consumer price index peaked at 8.3% in June before slowing to 7.3% by October. Sustained high inflation can lead </span><span>to price instability if businesses and consumers expect price increases to continue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Current global instabilities including within the U.S.’s largest trading partner, China, may disrupt the global economy already </span><span>impacted by high inflation rates. In addition, recent instability within the banking sector, which has affected some California-based</span><span> banks, may also negatively impact the state, national and global economies and increase the risk of a recession. The </span><span>May Revision revenue forecast is based on a scenario that assumes continued but slowing economic growth and does not </span><span>assume a recession. Several risk factors could negatively impact the economy and lead to a recession, which could either be </span><span>mild or more severe. A significant financial shock from tightening financial conditions, worsening of the recent banking crisis, </span><span>persistent supply chain issues, continued elevated inflation, further stock market and asset price declines, and geopolitical </span><span>turmoil are all issues that pose a risk to ongoing economic and revenue growth. The magnitude of the revenue loss from a </span><span>recession would depend upon the depth and duration of a recession, as well as its relative impact on higher-income </span><span>individuals. A mild recession could lead to General Fund revenue losses of over $20 billion relative to the May Revision </span><span>forecast in 2023-24.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>COVID-19 Pandemic and Social and Economic Impacts. </span><span>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect global health and may </span><span>continue to lead to governmental responses which negatively impact the economy. There can be no assurances that there </span><span>will not be a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and deaths, that existing or new COVID-19 variants will not increase the public </span><span>health crisis or that unavailability and/or lack of public acceptance of vaccines will not exacerbate or prolong the adverse </span><span>impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also no assurance that any additional federal aid will be forthcoming for the </span><span>State or its local governments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The long term consequences of the pandemic are yet to be known. For instance, if there are broad, long standing changes to </span><span>where people chose to live and work, the pandemic could, over time, change the key economic drivers of a community. As an </span><span>example, some employers may continue to provide additional flexibility for their employees remote work policies instituted </span><span>during the COVID 19 emergency. These unknowns create an unprecedented degree of uncertainty about the economic </span><span>outlook of local governments. These changes also could affect the value of commercial property and over time lead to </span><span>deceleration in local government property tax revenue growth. Many of the largest cities in the State, including notably San </span><span>Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have experienced some of the highest office vacancy rates in the Country.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Among other reasons, these vacancy rates reflect a reliance upon jobs in the technology industry (which are the most </span><span>vulnerable to remote working), as well as the impact of homelessness and crime upon the attractiveness of certain </span><span>commercial areas. Higher vacancy rates are resulting in dramatically lower commercial property values, which in turn are </span><span>projected to result in lower property taxes and other business tax revenue. These tax reductions, as well as increased costs to </span><span>address homelessness and crime could strain municipal budgets, potentially putting pressure on their credit quality.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Global Relations and Trade.</span><span> Given globalization and the interconnectedness of physical and financial world markets, </span><span>disruptions in large markets due to economic slowdowns in other countries or regions, geopolitical tensions and </span><span>deteriorating international trade relations, or the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (such as travel restrictions), may </span><span>have significant negative impacts on the nation’s economy, including on the State. There is significant uncertainty around </span><span>how the Russian invasion of Ukraine will evolve, as well as the conflict’s potential economic impacts to the U.S. and to </span><span>California.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The COVID-19 pandemic created global supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted domestic markets and reduced </span><span>trade volumes for the nation and the State. However, more recent information shows increased exports. The State’s exports </span><span>of goods totaled $174.9 billion in 2021, or 12.2% higher than in 2020 and totaled $185.6 billion in 2022, or 12.2% higher than </span><span>in 2021. This follows a decline of 10.3% in 2020 and a decline of 2.5% in 2019. Continued uncertainty surrounding the </span><span>stability of global supply chains and the unknown duration of the COVID-19 pandemic present ongoing risks to the U.S. and </span><span>California trade levels and economies.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>41</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Material changes in federal trade policy, including new or revised tariffs on the State’s trading partners, could directly and </span><span>indirectly impact the State’s economy. The 2019 U.S. tariffs of up to 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese products, </span><span>equivalent to half of the nation’s imports from China, remain in place as of April 2023. These tariffs triggered Chinese </span><span>retaliatory tariffs of 25% on over $50 billion worth of U.S. exports. Because the State is a transport hub, and China is the </span><span>State’s largest trading partner by total trade value of goods (based on 2021 annual average data), an ongoing trade war could </span><span>have negative effects on the State’s economy.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Potential trade barriers exacerbate the supply chain issues triggered by large-scale worldwide shutdowns during the COVID-19</span><span> pandemic. For example, potential trade disruptions associated with uncertainty surrounding China’s zero-tolerance </span><span>COVID-19 policy, which was in effect until December 2022, and threatened invasion of Taiwan, the world’s largest supplier of </span><span>semiconductors, could increase the costs of imports purchased from abroad leading to higher consumer prices and to </span><span>decreased business revenues. These effects could potentially impact wages and employment in the short run and could </span><span>trigger a change in the business model of companies that until now have made significant investment decisions based on a </span><span>system of free global trade.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Health Care Costs. </span><span>Medi-Cal is one of the State’s largest expenditures. The State also provides health benefits to its own </span><span>employees and retirees. General Fund spending on health care costs is thus heavily dependent upon the rate of health care </span><span>cost inflation. If this inflation rises faster than expected, annual General Fund spending could quickly rise by hundreds of </span><span>millions of dollars. See </span><span>“</span><span>The State Budget – Health Care Services.</span><span>”</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Housing Constraints.</span><span> The State continues to face a critical housing shortage despite California residential housing units </span><span>authorized by building permits (seasonally adjusted) averaging approximately 120,000 units through the first ten months of </span><span>2022, the highest levels since 2006. However, as of April 2023, the State projected that residential permit growth will slow in </span><span>2023 and 2024. Exceptionally strong housing demand driven by high-income earners in 2021 through early 2022 contributed </span><span>to record high home prices. The California median sales price of existing single-family homes exceeded $900,000 for the first </span><span>time in May 2022 and reached a record high of $900,170, just over a year after exceeding $800,000 for the first time. </span><span>However, as interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage rates, the demand for housing in the second half of 2022 began to fall </span><span>and the median sale price for housing also fell, reaching $751,330 in December 2022, a 16.5% decline from May. Low-income </span><span>Californians may face increasing affordability issues which may affect their decisions about where to live and work. Given the </span><span>State’s structural housing supply constraints and shortage, low-income populations will be especially vulnerable to housing </span><span>cost increases both in the rental and ownership markets. Furthermore, certain businesses may determine to leave California </span><span>to the extent location decisions are significantly influenced by the ability of their employees and customers to live nearby. In </span><span>addition, in certain urban areas in particular, the homeless population has grown in recent years, in some part due to a </span><span>significant lack of affordable housing. Homeless services programs may become a larger draw on local government funds </span><span>and may otherwise impact economic activity.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate Change.</span><span> The State historically has been susceptible to wildfires and hydrologic variability. In April 2023, the State </span><span>disclosed that as greenhouse gas emissions continue to accumulate, climate change will intensify and increase the frequency </span><span>of extreme weather events, such as coastal storm surges, drought, wildfires, floods and heat waves, and raise sea levels along </span><span>the coast of the State. Over the past several years, the State has already experienced the impacts of climate change through </span><span>multiple drought periods, flooding and unprecedented wildfires. As a result of drought conditions, water deliveries to the </span><span>agricultural sector declined in 2021 and 2022, with direct economic impacts from crop revenue losses. The State is once </span><span>again facing drought conditions as all of the State’s 58 counties entered a drought state of emergency in October 2021. In </span><span>early 2023, the State experienced significant precipitation events leading to severe flooding in various locations through the </span><span>State. While significant, the increased precipitation does not necessarily indicate the State is out of a period of drought. In </span><span>2020, over 4 million acres burned in California, more than twice the previous record of approximately 2 million acres in 2018. </span><span>Destruction of housing increases the demand for construction resources from rebuilding, and worsens the State’s housing </span><span>imbalances. The future fiscal impact of climate change on the State budget is difficult to predict, but it could be significant. </span><span>However, the State is in the process of implementing various resilience measures to reduce the impacts of climate change, </span><span>including significant investments in wildfire prevention and water infrastructure projects and workforce development. The </span><span>ability of the State to take actions to mitigate any future fiscal impact of climate change on the State budget is limited and </span><span>there can be no assurances that the current or any future resilience measures will be effective in materially mitigating the </span><span>impact of climate change on the State.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Energy Risks.</span><span> The State disclosed in April 2023 that another result of unprecedented climate-induced weather events, </span><span>including drought, extreme heat events and wildfires, is stress on the State’s electrical system. The future fiscal impact of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>42</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>stresses to the energy grid caused by climate is difficult for the State to predict, but could be significant. In recent years, </span><span>California has taken numerous steps to increase resiliency to be better prepared to meet the State’s electricity demands. The </span><span>State is now taking additional immediate actions by expanding demand response programs and creating additional </span><span>incentives to move large energy users to back-up power generation to address reliability concerns and implementing longer-term</span><span> actions, such as suspending certain permitting requirements to allow greater energy production.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risks.</span><span> The State, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology </span><span>environment to conduct its operations. The State’s reliance on this environment has increased due to higher rates of telework </span><span>as mandated by public health measures. As a recipient and provider of personal, private or sensitive information, the State is </span><span>subject to multiple cyber threats including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and </span><span>other sensitive digital networks and systems.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Entities or individuals may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the State’s digital systems for the purposes of </span><span>misappropriating assets or information or causing operational disruption and damage. In 2017 the State established a </span><span>statewide security operations center to protect against malicious activity targeting critical technology infrastructure. Local </span><span>governments in the State have experienced similar threats and taken similar measures; however, no assurances can be given </span><span>that the efforts to manage cyber threats and attacks will be successful or that any such attack will not materially impact the </span><span>operations or finances of the State or its local governments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Earthquake Risk.</span><span> Substantially all of California is within an active geologic region subject to major seismic activity. Northern </span><span>California in 1989 and Southern California in 1994 experienced major earthquakes causing billions of dollars in damages. The </span><span>federal government provided more than $13 billion in aid for both earthquakes, and neither event has had any long-term </span><span>negative economic impact. Any obligation of a local government in the State could be affected by an interruption of revenues </span><span>because of damaged facilities or, consequently, income tax deductions for casualty losses or property tax assessment </span><span>reductions. Compensatory financial assistance could be constrained by the inability of (i) an issuer to have obtained </span><span>earthquake insurance coverage; (ii) an insurer to perform on its contracts of insurance in the event of widespread losses; or </span><span>(iii) the federal or State government to appropriate sufficient funds within their respective budget limitations.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special Considerations Regarding Investments in New York Municipal Securities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following information is a brief summary of factors affecting the economy of New York City (the </span><span>“</span><span>City</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>New York </span><span>City</span><span>”</span><span>) or New York State (the </span><span>“</span><span>State</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>New York</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>NYS</span><span>”</span><span>) and does not purport to be a complete description of such </span><span>factors. Other factors will affect issuers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The summary is based primarily upon the most recent publicly available offering statements relating to debt offerings of </span><span>state and local issuers and other financial and demographic information, as of April 10, 2023 with respect to the City and </span><span>March 8, 2023 with respect to the State, and it does not reflect recent developments since the dates of such offering </span><span>statements and other information. Neither the Fund nor its legal counsel has independently verified this information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State, some of its agencies, instrumentalities and public authorities and certain of its municipalities have sometimes </span><span>faced serious financial difficulties that could have an adverse effect on the sources of payment for, or the market value of, the </span><span>New York municipal bonds in which the Fund invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NEW YORK CITY</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General</span><span>. The City, with an estimated population of approximately 8.5 million as of July 2021, is an international center of </span><span>business and culture. Its non-manufacturing economy is broadly based, with the banking, securities, insurance, technology, </span><span>information, publishing, fashion, design, retailing, education and health care industries accounting for a significant portion of </span><span>the City’s total employment earnings. Additionally, the City is a leading tourist destination. Manufacturing activity in the City </span><span>is conducted primarily in apparel and printing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For each of the 1981 through 2022 fiscal years, the City’s General Fund had an operating surplus, before discretionary and </span><span>other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results as reported in accordance with then-applicable generally accepted </span><span>accounting principles (</span><span>“</span><span>GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), after discretionary and other transfers and except for the application of Governmental </span><span>Accounting Standards Board (</span><span>“</span><span>GASB</span><span>”</span><span>) Statement No. 49 (</span><span>“</span><span>GASB 49</span><span>”</span><span>) and without regard to changes in certain fund </span><span>balances which may be carried forward as described below. City fiscal years end on June 30 and are referred to by the </span><span>calendar year in which they end. The City has been required to close substantial gaps between forecast revenues and forecast </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>43</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>expenditures in order to maintain balanced operating results. There can be no assurance that the City will continue to </span><span>maintain balanced operating results as required by State law without proposed tax or other revenue increases or reductions </span><span>in City services or entitlement programs, which could adversely affect the City’s economic base.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As required by the New York State Financial Emergency Act For The City of New York (the </span><span>“</span><span>Financial Emergency Act</span><span>”</span><span>) and </span><span>the New York City Charter (the </span><span>“</span><span>City Charter</span><span>”</span><span>), the City prepares a four-year annual financial plan, which is reviewed and </span><span>revised on a quarterly basis and which includes the City’s capital, revenue and expense projections and outlines proposed </span><span>gap-closing programs for years with projected budget gaps. The City’s current financial plan projects budget balance in the </span><span>2023 and 2024 fiscal years in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard to certain </span><span>fund balances, which may be carried forward as described below). In 2010, the Financial Emergency Act was amended to </span><span>waive the budgetary impact of GASB 49 by enabling the City to continue to finance with bond proceeds certain pollution </span><span>remediation costs. In addition, the City may, without violating its budget balance requirements, carry forward to a </span><span>subsequent fiscal year or fiscal years unspent balances from certain funds restricted as to their use, as well as balances in the </span><span>Health Insurance Stabilization Fund, School Crossing Guards Health Insurance Fund, Management Benefits Fund and </span><span>Revenue Stabilization Fund. The City’s current financial plan projects budget gaps for the 2025 through 2027 fiscal years. A </span><span>pattern of current year balance and projected future year budget gaps has been consistent through the entire period since </span><span>1982, during which the City has achieved an excess of revenues over expenditures, before discretionary transfers, for each </span><span>fiscal year. The City is required to submit its financial plans to the New York State Financial Control Board (the </span><span>“</span><span>Control </span><span>Board</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For its normal operations, the City depends on aid from the State both to enable the City to balance its budget and to meet its </span><span>cash requirements. There can be no assurance that there will not be delays or reductions in State aid to the City from </span><span>amounts currently projected; that State budgets for future State fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, </span><span>or interim appropriations will be enacted; or that any such reductions or delays will not have adverse effects on the City’s </span><span>cash flow or expenditures. In addition, the City has made various assumptions with respect to federal aid. Future federal </span><span>actions or inactions could have adverse effects on the City, both directly and indirectly through reductions in State aid to </span><span>localities that will need to be taken in the absence of additional federal aid to the State.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Mayor is responsible under the City Charter for preparing the City’s annual expense and capital budgets (as adopted, the </span><span>“</span><span>Expense Budget</span><span>”</span><span> and the </span><span>“</span><span>Capital Budget,</span><span>”</span><span> respectively, and collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Budgets</span><span>”</span><span>) and for submitting the Budgets to </span><span>the City Council for its review and adoption. The Expense Budget covers the City’s annual operating expenditures for </span><span>municipal services, while the Capital Budget covers expenditures for capital projects, as defined in the City Charter. </span><span>Operations under the Expense Budget must reflect the aggregate expenditure limitations contained in financial plans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Mayor is also responsible for preparing the City’s financial plan, which relates to the City and certain entities that receive </span><span>funds from the City. The financial plan is modified quarterly. The projections set forth in the financial plan are based on </span><span>various assumptions and contingencies which are uncertain and which may not materialize. Such assumptions and </span><span>contingencies include the condition of the international, national, regional and local economies, the provision of State and </span><span>federal aid and other State and federal actions and inactions, such as the potential consequences of not resolving the federal </span><span>debt ceiling negotiations, the impact on City revenues and expenditures of any future federal or State legislation and policies </span><span>affecting the City and the cost of pension structures and healthcare.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Implementation of the financial plan is dependent on the City’s ability to market successfully its bonds and notes. </span><span>Implementation of the financial plan is also dependent upon the ability to market the securities of other financing entities </span><span>including the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (the </span><span>“</span><span>Water Authority</span><span>”</span><span>) and the New York City Transitional </span><span>Finance Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>TFA</span><span>”</span><span>). The success of projected public sales of City, Water Authority, TFA and other bonds and notes is </span><span>subject to prevailing market conditions. Future developments in the financial markets generally, as well as future </span><span>developments concerning the City, and public discussion of such developments, may affect the market for outstanding City </span><span>general obligation bonds and notes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City Comptroller and other agencies and public officials, from time to time, issue reports and make public statements </span><span>that, among other things, state that projected revenues and expenditures may be different from those forecast in the City’s </span><span>financial plans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>City Financial Plan</span><span>. For the 2022 fiscal year, the City’s General Fund had a total surplus of $7.6 billion, before discretionary </span><span>and other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 </span><span>and without regard to certain fund balances permitted to be carried forward as described in </span><span>“</span><span>INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT,</span><span>”</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>44</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The 2022 fiscal year was the forty-second consecutive year that the City achieved </span><span>balanced operating results when reported in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without </span><span>regard to certain fund balances permitted to be carried forward.</span></div> <div> <div><span>2023-2027 Financial Plan</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On June 13, 2022, the City submitted to the Control Board the financial plan for the 2023 through 2026 fiscal years (the </span><span>“</span><span>June </span><span>Financial Plan</span><span>”</span><span>), which was consistent with the City’s capital and expense budgets as adopted for the 2023 fiscal year. On </span><span>November 15, 2022, the City submitted to the Control Board a modification to the June Financial Plan (as so modified, the </span><span>“</span><span>November Financial Plan</span><span>”</span><span>). On January 12, 2023, the Mayor released the preliminary budget for the 2024 fiscal year and the </span><span>City submitted to the Control Board a modification to the financial plan for the 2023 through 2027 fiscal years (as so </span><span>modified, the </span><span>“</span><span>Financial Plan</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan projects revenues and expenses for the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years balanced in accordance with GAAP, </span><span>except as described above, and projects gaps of approximately $3.17 billion, $5.01 billion and $6.47 billion in each of fiscal </span><span>years 2025, 2026 and 2027. The June Financial Plan had projected revenues and expenses for the 2023 fiscal year balanced in </span><span>accordance with GAAP, except as described above, and had projected gaps of approximately $4.21 billion, $3.71 billion and </span><span>$3.98 billion in fiscal years 2024 through 2026, respectively.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan, increases in projected net revenues of $1.69 billion, $799 million, </span><span>$693 million and $583 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively. Changes in projected revenues include: (i) </span><span>increases in business tax revenues of $775 million, $579 million, $522 million and $287 million in fiscal years 2023 through </span><span>2026, respectively; (ii) increases in sales tax revenues of $530 million, $295 million, $445 million and $595 million in fiscal </span><span>years 2023 through 2026, respectively; (iii) decreases in real estate transaction tax revenues of $173 million, $397 million, </span><span>$438 million and $375 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; and (iv) increases in hotel tax revenues of $121 </span><span>million, $24 million, $16 million and $14 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Changes in projected revenues also include (i) net increases in non-tax revenues of $368 million, $235 million, $100 million </span><span>and $17 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; and (ii) increases in revenues included in the Program to </span><span>Eliminate the Gap (the </span><span>“</span><span>PEG</span><span>”</span><span>) of $66 million, $63 million, $48 million and $45 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, </span><span>respectively.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan also reflects, since the June Financial Plan, net decreases in projected net expenditures of $480 million and </span><span>$1.24 billion in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, and net increases in projected net expenditures of $145 million and </span><span>$1.61 billion in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, respectively. Changes in projected expenditures include: (i) increases in agency </span><span>expenses of $656 million, $177 million, $443 million and $446 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; (ii) </span><span>decreases in agency expenses included in the PEG of $977 million, $1.72 billion, $1.62 billion and $1.59 billion in fiscal years </span><span>2023 through 2026, respectively; (iii) decreases of $75 million, $390 million and $425 million in fiscal years 2023 through </span><span>2025, respectively, reflecting reimbursements of expenditures with federal aid; (iv) decreases in debt service included in the </span><span>PEG of $84 million, $170 million, $227 million and $257 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; and (v) </span><span>increases in pension contributions, as described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The PEG savings described above are based on four categories of initiatives designed to close the gap between expenses and </span><span>revenues: (i) efficiency initiatives designed to improve the City’s finances without reducing services; (ii) expense re-estimates </span><span>due to a delay in spending or lower than expected costs; (iii) grant revenue re-estimates and increases in City revenues; and </span><span>(iv) reductions in debt service costs, primarily as a result of debt refinancing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan, provision of $2.17 billion for the prepayment in fiscal year 2023 of </span><span>fiscal year 2024 expenses, resulting in an equivalent expenditure reduction in fiscal year 2024.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan also reflects the estimated impact of fiscal year 2022 investment returns of negative 8.65% (net of </span><span>investment fees).

There can be no assurance that the authorization to sell real property </span><span>tax liens will be reinstated or that, as a result, amounts projected in the Financial Plan to be received from such sales will be </span><span>realized. In the event that the lien sale program is not re-authorized, real property tax delinquencies are expected to increase </span><span>beyond the rates assumed in the Financial Plan. Each 1% increase in delinquencies would reduce property tax revenues by </span><span>approximately $339 million, $344 million, $347 million, $348 million and $348 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </span><span>respectively.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City has reached a tentative labor contract settlement with District Council 37 of AFSME (</span><span>“</span><span>DC 37</span><span>”</span><span>) for the 2021-2026 </span><span>round of collective bargaining. The tentative settlement provides for annual wage increases of 3% in each of the first four </span><span>years of the settlement, commencing retroactively on May 26, 2021, followed by a 3.25% wage increase commencing on </span><span>May 26, 2025. The settlement also includes a $3,000 bonus to be paid at the time of ratification of the agreement. If the DC </span><span>37 settlement is ratified by the union and the pattern of such settlement is applied to all City employees, the cost to the City </span><span>would be approximately $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </span><span>respectively. Such costs are in excess of amounts currently included in the Financial Plan, which reflects funding for annual </span><span>1.25% wage increases following the expiration of the labor contracts covering the 2017-2021 round of collective bargaining.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On April 4, 2023, the Director of Management and Budget of the City issued a Program to Eliminate the Gap (</span><span>“</span><span>PEG</span><span>”</span><span>) letter to </span><span>City agencies. Citing developments that are placing a severe strain on the City’s budget, including the costs of caring for </span><span>asylum seekers, the need to fully fund labor reserves for collective bargaining settlements and cuts and cost shifts in the </span><span>Governor’s Executive Budget, the letter established a 4% savings target in fiscal years 2024-2027 that applies to all City </span><span>agencies except the Department of Education and the City University of New York, which will be subject to a 3% savings </span><span>target. The PEG letter states that savings initiatives may not include layoffs and should avoid meaningfully impacting services </span><span>where possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City has reached a tentative labor contract settlement with the Police Benevolent Association for the period 2017-2025. </span><span>The first three years of the tentative settlement are consistent with raises other uniformed unions received in the last round </span><span>of collective bargaining. The subsequent five years of the tentative settlement establish the framework for other uniformed </span><span>unions. If the Police Benevolent Association settlement is ratified by the union and assuming all other uniformed unions settle </span><span>on similar terms, the aggregate cost to the City would be approximately $230 million in excess of the cost the City would </span><span>incur if the pattern established by the DC 37 settlement, which has now been ratified, were applied to all City employees. All </span><span>such costs are in excess of amounts currently reflected in the Financial Plan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City and the Municipal Labor Committee are proceeding with implementation of a Medicare Advantage (</span><span>“</span><span>MA</span><span>”</span><span>) plan for </span><span>City retirees by September 1, 2023. Implementation of the plan is expected to generate an estimated $600 million in annual </span><span>savings in retiree health benefit costs. Contemporaneously with implementation of the MA plan, the City will revoke the </span><span>current Senior Care plan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan does not reflect the potential costs to the City of proposals contained in the Governor’s Executive Budget </span><span>for State fiscal year 2023-2024, which was released on February 1, 2023 (the </span><span>“</span><span>Governor’s Executive Budget</span><span>”</span><span>). The City </span><span>projects that the Governor’s Executive Budget proposals, if enacted, would be a net positive impact on the City of $168 </span><span>million in fiscal year 2023, followed by a net negative impact on the City of $461 million and $1.34 billion in fiscal years 2024 </span><span>and 2025 respectively, the primary components of which are described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Governor’s Executive Budget includes a proposal for increased City funding to the MTA of approximately $530 million in </span><span>fiscal year 2024, with expected increases in subsequent fiscal years. The increased funding requirements include (i) </span><span>increasing the City’s share of funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 50% to 100% which is estimated to </span><span>cost the City $266 million in fiscal year 2024 and increasing thereafter (as discussed below, the Financial Plan does not reflect </span><span>previously enacted legislation increasing the City’s share of such deficit from 33% to 50%), (ii) requiring that the City </span><span>increase its annual payments to the MTA for reduced-fare MetroCards for City students in grades kindergarten through </span><span>twelve (which is estimated to cost the City $105 million per fiscal year) and (iii) requiring that the City pay an amount equal </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>46</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

As an employer, the City will incur additional costs as a result of the proposed increase in the payroll </span><span>mobility tax, which is expected to cost $40 million per fiscal year, starting in fiscal year 2024.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Governor’s Executive Budget also includes two proposals relating to the number of charter schools in the City, each of </span><span>which includes no additional State funding. The first such proposal would eliminate the regional cap on the number of </span><span>charter schools in the City, allowing up to 85 additional charter schools to open. The costs to the City of this proposal are </span><span>expected to increase over time, depending on the total number of schools which open and the timing of their openings. It is </span><span>estimated that this proposal could cost the City $1 billion annually when fully phased in. The second proposal would allow </span><span>for the re-issuance of charters for charter schools in the City that have closed since July 2015 or will close in the future. Like </span><span>the regional cap changes, the impact on the City would depend on the total number of schools that open and the timing of </span><span>those openings. It is estimated that the proposal, if enacted, could cost the City up to $300 million per fiscal year when fully </span><span>phased in.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Governor’s Executive Budget also proposes instituting automatic minimum wage increases based on inflation, which </span><span>would cost the City approximately $15 million, $35 million, $55 million, and $75 million in fiscal years 2024, 2025, 2026 and </span><span>2027, respectively. The cost to the City could be much higher depending on inflation rates and other factors. Additionally, the </span><span>Governor has proposed ceasing to pass along federal eFMAP funding to localities, including the City. Such funding is typically </span><span>used to help localities cover the costs of Medicaid. The cost to the City of such proposal is at a minimum of $125 million in </span><span>fiscal year 2023 and $343 million in each fiscal year thereafter. The eFMAP proposal is an administrative action which can be </span><span>implemented at the Governor’s discretion, without State legislation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Governor’s Executive Budget also proposes changes to certain payment and review procedures which will inhibit the </span><span>ability of health plans, including those paid for by the City, to control costs. The cost to the City is expected to be $111 million </span><span>in fiscal year 2024 and $265 million in fiscal year 2025, rising each year thereafter to result in costs of about $380 million </span><span>annually by fiscal year 2030.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State Budget for the State 2023 fiscal year also mandates that adoption, foster care, and related service providers be </span><span>compensated at 100% of maximum State aid rates. Such mandate reflects the requirements of a recent lawsuit. The </span><span>legislation requires increased City funding for such services of up to $47 million in fiscal year 2023 and $118 million per fiscal </span><span>year starting in fiscal year 2024, which is not reflected in the Financial Plan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan does not reflect future increases in the charter school per-pupil tuition rate, which, if not offset by changes </span><span>to State education aid to the City that occur each year during the State budget process, are preliminarily estimated to cost </span><span>the City $81 million in fiscal year 2024, $133 million in fiscal year 2025, $313 million in fiscal year 2026 and $514 million in </span><span>fiscal year 2027. Final figures that would determine the actual costs to the City for each fiscal year will not be finalized until </span><span>the time of the State budget process applicable for such fiscal year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan does not reflect the potential costs from a New York State Court decision issued in July 2022 which </span><span>increased the statutory rate per hour for court appointed counsel from of $75 per hour to $158 per hour. The City has </span><span>appealed the court’s decision. If the $158 per hour rate remains, such rate would result in increased costs to the City of </span><span>approximately $84 million per year, unless offset by funding from the State. The Governor’s Executive Budget described </span><span>above proposes to statutorily mandate the increased $158 per hour rate, which would mandate the increased pay regardless </span><span>of the outcome of the litigation. The Governor’s Executive Budget does not include State funding for such increased pay. The </span><span>City continues to seek a change in State law to have such cost increase funded by the State.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On October 7, 2022, the Mayor declared a State of Emergency as a result of the recent increase in arrival of asylum seekers </span><span>from Central and South America. The arrival of the asylum seekers is placing a strain on the City’s resources. The City expects </span><span>that the crisis will cost $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 and $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2024. The full costs to the City of providing </span><span>services to asylum seekers during Financial Plan period is not known at this time. The Financial Plan assumes $1 billion in </span><span>federal funds for costs related to asylum seekers in fiscal year 2023, which is subject to appropriation by the federal </span><span>government, with no funding reflected in fiscal years 2024 and beyond. The Governor’s Executive Budget proposed </span><span>reimbursing the City for 29% of the City’s costs related to asylum seekers up to $1 billion in costs over the next two State </span><span>fiscal years. In addition, the federal government has allocated approximately $800 million for costs related to caring for </span><span>asylum seekers to be allocated nationwide. The City is working to secure as large a portion of such funding as possible.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>47</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan also does not reflect the impact of a State requirement that the City increase its share of funding of the </span><span>MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 33% to 50%. The Financial Plan reflects $175 million in each of fiscal years 2023 </span><span>through 2027 to cover the City’s contributions for paratransit services compared to MTA’s estimates of such costs of $223 </span><span>million, $250 million, $264 million and $278 million in fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. The MTA has not </span><span>yet released an estimate for fiscal year 2027. As described above, the Governor’s Executive Budget proposes to increase the </span><span>City’s share of funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 50% to 100% starting in fiscal year 2024. Such </span><span>increased costs are not reflected in the Financial Plan. The Financial Plan further does not reflect full funding to cover </span><span>projected increases in the annual operating deficit of the MTA Bus Company, which the City is obligated to fund. The </span><span>Financial Plan reflects $487 million in fiscal year 2023 and $478 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027, compared </span><span>to MTA’s estimate of such costs of $514 million, $792 million, $805 million and $819 million in fiscal years 2023 through </span><span>2026, respectively. The MTA has not released an estimate for fiscal year 2027.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan does not fully reflect likely future costs for pupil transportation and legally mandated tuition for special </span><span>education students unilaterally placed by their families in private school settings. The City is closely monitoring these costs </span><span>and while a number is not currently known, they are likely to be significant.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan does not reflect the impact of a recently enacted State law which mandates certain maximum class sizes </span><span>in public school kindergarten through twelfth grades, to be phased in over five years. It is estimated compliance will cost </span><span>approximately $1.3 billion per fiscal year when the requirement is fully phased in. The City is seeking a change to the State </span><span>law to have it apply only to kindergarten through third grade and is also seeking State funding to cover the cost of </span><span>compliance.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On January 31, 2019, NYCHA, the City and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (</span><span>“</span><span>HUD</span><span>”</span><span>) entered into an </span><span>agreement (the </span><span>“</span><span>HUD Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>) relating to lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns in NYCHA’s properties. </span><span>The HUD Agreement established a framework by which NYCHA will continue to evaluate and progress towards compliance </span><span>with federal requirements. Pursuant to the HUD Agreement, a federal monitor, with access to NYCHA information and </span><span>personnel, has been appointed to oversee NYCHA’s compliance with the terms of the agreement and federal regulations. The </span><span>federal monitor has issued and will continue to issue quarterly reports on NYCHA’s compliance with the HUD Agreement. </span><span>Also pursuant to the HUD Agreement, the City allocated $1.9 billion in capital funding in the Capital Commitment Plan for </span><span>fiscal years 2023-2027, with an additional $1.3 billion in City capital funds reflected in the remaining years of the Ten-Year </span><span>Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2028 through 2033. NYCHA subsequently announced that it may be out of compliance with a </span><span>number of federal regulations beyond the regulations concerning lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns that </span><span>were the subject of the HUD Agreement and is working to assess the extent of any such noncompliance. NYCHA’s 2017 </span><span>Physical Needs Assessment estimated its projected capital costs at approximately $32 billion over the next five years. In </span><span>January 2020, NYCHA’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated that such costs were $40 billion. Through the Permanent </span><span>Affordability Commitment Together program, which leverages project-based Section 8 subsidy and partnerships with private </span><span>and non-profit development partners to make repairs, NYCHA plans to recapitalize approximately 62,000 of its units. As of </span><span>January 30, 2023, NYCHA and development partners completed renovations on 5,830 apartments, are actively repairing </span><span>another 10,153 apartments, and are in predevelopment for an additional 20,120 apartments. In June 2022, the State enacted </span><span>legislation creating the New York City Housing Preservation Trust, which will leverage federal funding to borrow money for </span><span>the improvement of an additional approximately 25,000 public housing units. The New York City Housing Preservation Trust </span><span>is not funded by the City and is not reflected in the Financial Plan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NYCHA’s rent collection rate, which has historically been approximately 90%, is currently approximately 65%. As a result, </span><span>NYCHA is projecting a substantial reduction in rent revenues in calendar year 2023. This reduction in NYCHA’s revenues has </span><span>required that NYCHA rely on its reserves to cover expenses, eliminate budgeted vacancies, and reduce nonessential </span><span>contracting. While this projected shortfall does not directly impact the City’s budget, if NYCHA’s revenues do not recover, the </span><span>City could be asked to increase its funding to NYCHA.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the City appropriated a total of $69 million for a program to support the restructuring of loans </span><span>to the owners of up to 4,000 taxi medallions to terms that are more affordable to the medallion owners. The $69 million </span><span>appropriation supplemented a previously paid grant from the City of $65 million for the same purpose. The funds will be </span><span>used by the program administrator to cover shortfalls in amounts owed by taxi medallion owners on defaulted restructured </span><span>loans to the extent such shortfall is not covered by the proceeds from the sale of the related medallions. In addition, the City </span><span>has undertaken, subject to appropriation, to make available additional funding in the future if necessary to cover defaulted </span><span>loans. The Financial Plan does not include any additional funding for the program. To date, approximately 1,800 loans have </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>48</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>been restructured under the program, reducing the principal on the restructured loans by a total of approximately $350 </span><span>million. Based on the expected maximum restructured loan amount and current market conditions affecting the sale of </span><span>medallions, the shortfall of each defaulted loan after the application of the sale proceeds of the associated medallion could </span><span>be up to $60,000. Such amount is expected to vary based on future market conditions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>State legislation provides for congestion tolling for vehicles entering a designated congestion zone in Manhattan below 60th </span><span>Street, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Details of the plan, including pricing, </span><span>have yet to be determined, but it is currently expected that the start date will occur in 2024.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The New York City Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform was established in 2018 to consider changes to the City’s </span><span>property taxation system, without reducing property tax revenues to the City. The commission released its report in </span><span>December 2021 with recommendations which, among other things, would align the taxable value of certain properties more </span><span>closely with market value. The commission’s recommendations, which have not yet been acted upon, would require State </span><span>legislation if they were to be implemented.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City is experiencing an increased level of employee vacancies across its agencies, reflecting a nationwide trend impacting </span><span>both the private and public sectors. As part of its spending-reduction initiatives, on November 21, 2022, the City announced a </span><span>vacancy reduction target of reducing agency vacancies by fifty percent of the number of unfilled vacancies as of October 31, </span><span>2022. The vacancy reduction initiative does not apply to health and safety positions, uniform employees, teachers, and </span><span>certain other employees. The implementation of the vacancy reduction initiative has reduced the number of vacancies </span><span>Citywide by approximately 4,300 employees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, the City Comptroller, the Control Board staff, the Office of the State Deputy Comptroller for the City of </span><span>New York (</span><span>“</span><span>OSDC</span><span>”</span><span>), the Independent Budget Office (</span><span>“</span><span>IBO</span><span>”</span><span>) and others issue reports and make public statements regarding </span><span>the City’s financial condition, commenting on, among other matters, the City’s financial plans, projected revenues and </span><span>expenditures and actions by the City to eliminate projected operating deficits. It is reasonable to expect that reports and </span><span>statements will continue to be issued and may contain different perspectives on the City’s budget and economy and may </span><span>engender public comment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>COVID-19</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City has been severely affected by the coronavirus disease, referred to herein as </span><span>“</span><span>COVID-19.</span><span>”</span><span> A state of emergency </span><span>remained in effect for the City through May 31, 2023, and may be extended. A state of emergency declared by the State </span><span>expired on September 13, 2022. During periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the City were ordered to </span><span>close, public schools moved to remote learning, limitations were imposed on large gatherings, and certain vaccination </span><span>requirements and mask mandates were put in place.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The reduction in business activity, travel and tourism resulting from the pandemic had a severe impact on the City’s retail, </span><span>cultural, hospitality and entertainment sectors. Hotel occupancy declined drastically, as did arrivals to City airports. As a </span><span>result of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment rates throughout the City increased substantially and currently remain </span><span>above pre-pandemic levels. To date, the City has recovered approximately 90% of jobs lost during the pandemic. Certain real </span><span>estate sectors have sustained losses as a result of the business distress caused by COVID-19. Higher unemployment as well </span><span>as increased numbers of employees working from home due to the pandemic have stressed the City’s office market. The </span><span>pandemic has also reduced income for retail stores and hotels. Property tax revenues declined in fiscal year 2022 from the </span><span>pandemic impact but rebounded in fiscal year 2023. Growth is projected to average 0.6 percent from fiscal years 2024 </span><span>through 2027. The pandemic has also resulted in a decline in the City’s estimated population. The United States Census </span><span>Bureau estimates the City’s population to be 8,467,513 as of July 2021, which shows a decline of 336,677 City residents as </span><span>compared to the 2020 Census.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Uncertainties remain for commercial office markets as future demand may depend on decisions of major office tenants </span><span>regarding density, remote work and relocation of operations out of the City. Personal income tax revenue projections could be </span><span>negatively affected by changes in employment and earnings including, but not limited to, (i) changes in residency status </span><span>resulting from remote work, (ii) permanent relocation outside the City of individuals with high incomes (the highest 1% of </span><span>earners accounted for approximately 43% of total personal income tax revenues in calendar year 2020), or (iii) other </span><span>employment-related changes. In addition, sales tax revenue projections could be negatively impacted by future reductions in </span><span>economic activity.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>49</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The future course of the pandemic is uncertain and will be determined by many factors, including vaccination rates, the </span><span>effectiveness of vaccines in preventing infections, hospitalizations and deaths, adherence to public health mitigation </span><span>measures (including masks and social distancing) and the emergence of new virus variants. There can be no assurance that </span><span>the City will not experience future surges or that rates of cases, hospitalizations and deaths will not increase significantly in </span><span>the future. There can be no assurances as to what further impacts the pandemic may have on the City’s population and </span><span>economy or that new pandemic-related restrictions will not be imposed in the future. An outbreak of disease or public health </span><span>emergency, including a resurgence of COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on the City’s population and economy and </span><span>may result in revenues to the City that are lower than projected herein.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Assumptions</span><span>. The Financial Plan is based on numerous assumptions, including the condition of the City’s and the region’s </span><span>economies and the concomitant receipt of economically sensitive tax revenues in the amounts projected. The Financial Plan </span><span>assumes no economic recession during the years of the Financial Plan. The Financial Plan is subject to various other </span><span>uncertainties and contingencies relating to, among other factors, the extent, if any, to which wage increases for City </span><span>employees exceed the annual wage costs assumed; realization of projected earnings for pension fund assets and current </span><span>assumptions with respect to wages for City employees affecting the City’s required pension fund contributions; the </span><span>willingness and ability of the State to provide the aid contemplated by the Financial Plan and to take various other actions to </span><span>assist the City; the ability of New York City Health and Hospitals (</span><span>“</span><span>NYCHH</span><span>”</span><span>) and other such entities to maintain balanced </span><span>budgets; the willingness of the federal government to provide the amount of federal aid contemplated in the Financial Plan; </span><span>the impact on City revenues and expenditures of federal and State legislation affecting Medicare or other entitlement </span><span>programs; adoption of the City’s budgets by the City Council in substantially the forms submitted by the Mayor; the ability of </span><span>the City to implement cost reduction initiatives, and the success with which the City controls expenditures; the impact of </span><span>conditions in the real estate market on real estate tax revenues; the ability of the City and other financing entities to market </span><span>their securities successfully in the public credit markets; the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19; and the extension of the </span><span>authorization to sell real property tax liens. See </span><span>“</span><span>Certain Reports</span><span>”</span><span> herein.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The projections and assumptions contained in the Financial Plan are subject to revision, which may be substantial.

Real </span><span>Estate Tax revenue projections for fiscal years 2023 through 2026 reflect certain City tax programs proposed by the </span><span>Mayor and adopted by the New York State legislature.

Projections of real estate tax revenues reflect the estimated cost of </span><span>extending the current tax reduction for owners of cooperative and condominium apartments amounting to $668 </span><span>million, $671 million, $677 million, $684 million and $684 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The delinquency rate was 1.2% in fiscal year 2018, 1.2% in fiscal year 2019, 1.8% in fiscal year 2020, 2.0% in fiscal year </span><span>2021 and 1.8% in fiscal year 2022. The Financial Plan projects delinquency rates of 1.8% in fiscal year 2023, 1.6% in </span><span>fiscal year 2024 and 1.7% in each of fiscal years 2025 through 2027.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On April 24, 2017, a lawsuit was filed challenging the City’s real property tax system and valuation methodology. The </span><span>action alleges that the City’s real property tax system violates the State and federal constitutions as well as the Fair </span><span>Housing Act. The action further alleges the valuation methodology as mandated by certain provisions of the State Real </span><span>Property Tax Law results in a disparity and inequality in the amount of taxes paid by Black and Hispanic Class 1 property </span><span>owners and renters. The Appellate Division, First Department granted the City’s motion to dismiss and dismissed all </span><span>claims against the City. In September 2020, the New York Court of Appeals dismissed the plaintiff’s purported appeal as </span><span>of right of the First Department rulings. On August 9, 2021, the plaintiff filed, in the Appellate Division, a motion for leave </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>50</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Appellate Division denied the </span><span>plaintiff’s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. On December 1, 2021 the plaintiff served and filed a motion </span><span>seeking leave to appeal directly from the Court of Appeals. The City and State submitted their respective opposition </span><span>papers. On April 28, 2022, the Court of Appeals granted the plaintiff’s motion for leave to appeal. Plaintiff filed an appeal </span><span>brief on July 27, 2022. Response briefs from the City and State were filed on December 12, 2022. The plaintiff’s reply brief </span><span>was filed on March 3, 2023.</span> <br/></div> <div> <div><span>Other Taxes</span><span>. The Financial Plan reflects the following assumptions regarding projected baseline revenues from Other </span><span>Taxes: (i) with respect to the personal income tax, declines in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024 revenues reflecting a </span><span>drop in Wall Street profits from the high levels seen in the prior years, moderate growth from fiscal years 2025 through </span><span>2027 as Wall Street profits revert back to historical averages; (ii) with respect to the business corporation tax, decline in </span><span>revenues in fiscal years 2023 and fiscal year 2024 reflecting economic headwinds from a weakened outlook for Wall </span><span>Street profits followed by moderate growth in fiscal years 2025 through 2027; (iii) with respect to the unincorporated </span><span>business income tax, a decline in fiscal year 2023 reflecting a weaker Wall Street performance, a weaker growth in fiscal </span><span>year 2024 reflecting slower economic growth and a return to moderate growth in fiscal years 2025 through 2027; (iv) </span><span>with respect to the sales tax, strong growth in fiscal year 2023 from strong consumer spending along with robust </span><span>growth in the tourism, hospitality and entertainment industries, growth moderates in fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (v) </span><span>with respect to the real property transfer tax, a decline in fiscal year 2023 from a slow-down in residential activity </span><span>reflecting the impact of rising interest rates and stalled commercial transactions, growth returns from fiscal years 2024 </span><span>to 2027 reflecting steady economic growth; (vi) with respect to the mortgage recording tax, declines in fiscal year 2023 </span><span>and 2024 as the impact from the higher interest rates reverberates through the residential and commercial markets </span><span>before growth returns to the long-term trend in fiscal years 2025 through 2027 reflecting steady economic growth; and </span><span>(vii) with respect to the commercial rent tax, a decline in fiscal year 2023 reflecting high vacancy rates for commercial </span><span>office space in Manhattan and flat growth from fiscal years 2024 through 2027, as uncertainties remain about office </span><span>space use.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Miscellaneous Revenues</span><span>. The Financial Plan reflects collections from Miscellaneous Revenues in the amounts of </span><span>approximately $8.0 billion in fiscal year 2023, $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2024, $7.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 and $7.3 billion </span><span>in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Intergovernmental Aid</span><span>. The Financial Plan assumes that all existing federal and State categorical grant programs will </span><span>continue, unless specific legislation provides for their termination or adjustment, and assumes increases in aid where </span><span>increased costs are projected for existing grant programs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of January 31, 2023, approximately 17.4% of the City’s full-time and full-time equivalent employees (consisting of </span><span>employees of the mayoral agencies and the DOE) were paid by Community Development funds, water and sewer funds </span><span>and from other sources not funded by unrestricted revenues of the City.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A major component of federal categorical aid to the City is the Community Development program. Pursuant to federal </span><span>legislation, Community Development grants are provided to cities primarily to aid low and moderate income persons by </span><span>improving housing facilities, parks and other improvements, by providing certain social programs and by promoting </span><span>economic development. These grants are based on a formula that takes into consideration such factors as population, </span><span>age of housing and poverty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City’s receipt of categorical aid is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions and is subject to </span><span>subsequent audits, possible disallowances and possible prior claims by the State or federal governments. The general </span><span>practice of the State and federal governments has been to deduct the amount of any disallowances against the current </span><span>year’s payment, although in some cases the City remits payment for disallowed amounts to the grantor. Substantial </span><span>disallowances of aid claims may be asserted during the course of the Financial Plan. The City estimates probable </span><span>amounts of disallowances of recognized grant revenues and makes the appropriate adjustments to recognized grant </span><span>revenue for each fiscal year. The amounts of such downward adjustments to revenue for disallowances attributable to </span><span>prior years increased from $124 million in the 1977 fiscal year to $542 million in the 2006 fiscal year. The amounts of </span><span>such disallowances were $103 million and $114 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, respectively. There were no </span><span>adjustments for estimated disallowances in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. In fiscal year 2011, the downward adjustment for </span><span>disallowances was $113 million and in fiscal year 2012 an upward adjustment of $166 million was made, reflecting a </span><span>reduced estimate of disallowances attributable to prior years as of June 30, 2012. In fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, </span><span>2020 and 2021, downward adjustments of $59 million, $19 million, $110 million, $1 million, $5 million and $24 million, </span><span>respectively, were made. In fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, upward adjustments of $558 million, $139 million and $113 </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>51</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>million, respectively, were made. In fiscal year 2022 a downward adjustment of $35 million was made. As of June 30, </span><span>2022, the City had an accumulated reserve of $318 million for all disallowances of categorical aid.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Expenditure Assumptions</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Personal Service Costs</span><span>. The Financial Plan projects that the authorized number of City-funded full-time and full-time </span><span>equivalent employees will decrease from an estimated level of 268,268 as of June 30, 2023 to an estimated level of </span><span>267,409 by June 30, 2027.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan does not reflect the full costs of the recent tentative labor settlement with DC 37. If the DC 37 </span><span>settlement is ratified by the union and the pattern of such settlement is applied to all City employees, the cost to the City </span><span>would be approximately $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through </span><span>2027, respectively. Such costs are in excess of amounts currently included in the Financial Plan, which reflects funding </span><span>for annual 1.25% wage increases following the expiration of the labor contracts covering the previous 2017-2021 round </span><span>of collective bargaining. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Than Personal Services (</span><span>“</span><span>OTPS</span><span>”</span><span>).</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Administrative OTPS and Energy</span><span>. The Financial Plan contains estimates of the City’s administrative OTPS expenditures </span><span>for general supplies and materials, equipment and selected contractual services, and the impact of agency gap-closing </span><span>actions relating to such expenditures in the 2023 fiscal year. Thereafter, OTPS administrative expenditures are projected </span><span>to remain the same in fiscal years 2024 through 2027. Energy costs for each of the 2023 through 2027 fiscal years are </span><span>assumed to vary annually, with total energy expenditures projected at $1.18 billion in fiscal year 2023 and increasing to </span><span>$1.21 billion by fiscal year 2027.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Public Assistance</span><span>. Of total cash assistance expenditures in the City, the City-funded portion is projected to be $819 </span><span>million in fiscal year 2023, $891 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026, and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Medical Assistance</span><span>. Medical assistance payments projected in the Financial Plan consist of payments to voluntary </span><span>hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, home care providers, pharmacies, managed care </span><span>organizations, physicians and other medical practitioners. The City-funded portion of medical assistance payments is </span><span>expected to be $6.45 billion in fiscal year 2023, $6.3 billion in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026 and $6.4 billion in </span><span>fiscal year 2027. Such payments include the City’s capped share of local Medicaid expenditures as well as Supplemental </span><span>Medicaid payments to NYCHH.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>New York City Health and Hospitals</span><span>. NYCHH, which provides essential services to over 1.1 million New Yorkers annually, </span><span>faces near- and long-term financial challenges resulting from, among other things, changes in hospital reimbursement </span><span>under the Affordable Care Act and the statewide transition to managed care. On April 26, 2016, the City released </span><span>“</span><span>One </span><span>New York: Health Care for Our Neighborhoods,</span><span>”</span><span> a report outlining the City’s plan to address NYCHH’s financial shortfall.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In February 2023, NYCHH released a cash-based financial plan, which projected City-funded expenditures of $1.6 billion </span><span>in fiscal year 2023, $913 million in fiscal year 2024, $910 million in fiscal year 2025 and $874 million in each of fiscal years </span><span>2026 and 2027, in addition to the forgiveness of debt service for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 and the City’s </span><span>contribution to supplemental Medicaid payments which is consistent with the City’s Financial Plan. NYCHH’s financial </span><span>plan projected total receipts of $10.5 billion, $9.3 billion, $9.4 billion, $9.2 billion and $9.3 billion, and total </span><span>disbursements of $10.7 billion, $9.84 billion, $9.3 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.6 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </span><span>respectively.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NYCHH relies on significant projected revenue from Medicaid, Medicare and other third-party payor programs. Future </span><span>changes to such programs could have adverse impacts on NYCHH’s financial condition.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other</span><span>. The projections set forth in the Financial Plan for OTPS-Other include the City’s contributions to New York City </span><span>Transit (</span><span>“</span><span>NYCT</span><span>”</span><span>), NYCHA, City University of New York (</span><span>“</span><span>CUNY</span><span>”</span><span>) and subsidies to libraries and various cultural </span><span>institutions. They also include projections for the cost of future judgments and claims, which are discussed below under </span><span>“</span><span>Judgments and Claims.</span><span>”</span><span> In the past, the City has provided additional assistance to certain State governmental agencies, </span><span>public authorities or public benefit corporations which receive or may receive monies from the City directly, indirectly or </span><span>contingently (</span><span>“</span><span>Covered Organizations</span><span>”</span><span>) that had exhausted their financial resources prior to the end of the fiscal year No </span><span>assurance can be given that similar additional assistance will not be required in the future.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>New York City Transit</span><span>. NYCT operates under its own section of the Financial Plan as a Covered Organization. An accrual-based</span><span> financial plan for NYCT covering its 2023 through 2026 fiscal years was published in February 2023 (the </span><span>“</span><span>2023 </span><span>NYCT Financial Plan</span><span>”</span><span>). The NYCT fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan reflects the </span><span>negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on MTA costs, ridership, and farebox revenue. The 2023 NYCT Financial </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>52</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Plan reflects City assistance to the NYCT operating budget of $464.7 million in 2023, increasing to $508.2 million in </span><span>2026. In addition, the 2023 NYCT Financial Plan projects real estate transfer tax revenue dedicated for NYCT use of </span><span>$533.1 million in 2023, which is lower than the $777.3 million of such revenue that was received in 2022; that amount </span><span>increases each year to reach $631.7 million by 2026. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan includes decreased expected farebox </span><span>revenue based on projected lower ridership. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan reflects $11.6 billion in revenues and $15.4 </span><span>billion in expenses for 2023, leaving a budget gap of $3.8 billion. After accounting for accrual adjustments and cash </span><span>carried over from 2022, there are projected operating budget gaps of $0.4 billion in 2023, $2.5 billion in 2024, $4.8 billion </span><span>in 2025 and $7.2 billion in 2026. These figures reflect the receipt of $7 billion in federal aid from the American Rescue </span><span>Plan Act (ARPA), which is being used to partially offset the outyear deficits.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In 2009, a Payroll Mobility Tax (</span><span>“</span><span>PMT</span><span>”</span><span>) was enacted into State law to provide $0.34 for every $100 of payroll in the MTA’s </span><span>twelve-county service area. The PMT is currently expected to generate revenues for NYCT in the amount of $947 million </span><span>in 2023, decreasing to $622 million in 2026.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The MTA faces serious budget shortfalls from historic declines in fare and tax revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic </span><span>and its effects on the region. Federal aid, fare increases and operational efficiencies will allow the MTA to substantially </span><span>reduce over $3 billion in annual out-year deficits to roughly $0.6 billion in 2023, $1.2 billion in 2024, $1.2 billion in 2025, </span><span>and $1.6 billion in 2026. The City's payments to the MTA remain dependent on future uncertainties such as additional </span><span>federal funding, ridership trends, and service adjustments.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The 2015-2019 Capital Program currently includes $33.9 billion for all MTA agencies, including $16.7 billion to be </span><span>invested in the NYCT core system and $1.7 billion for NYCT network expansion.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State has agreed to contribute $9.1 billion towards the 2015-2019 Capital Program. The City has agreed to </span><span>contribute $2.656 billion. Of the City’s contribution, $2.056 billion has been reflected in the City’s Capital Commitment </span><span>Plan, including $164.0 million for the Subway Action Plan. The remaining $600.0 million will come from joint ventures, </span><span>such as development deals, which will not flow through the City budget.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On September 19, 2019, the MTA released its 2020-2024 Capital Program, which took effect by default in January 2020. </span><span>After amendment, the program includes $55.4 billion for all MTA agencies, including $34.6 billion to be invested in the </span><span>NYCT core system and $4.6 billion in NYCT network expansion. The entire 2020-2024 Capital Program was placed on </span><span>hold in 2020 but resumed upon the announcement of $6.5 billion in federal aid in the ARPA in March of 2021. The </span><span>program was amended twice from its original $54.8 billion total, once in December 2021 and once in July 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Legislation adopted in 2019 includes the enactment of congestion tolling for vehicles entering a designated congestion </span><span>zone in Manhattan below 60th Street, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. In </span><span>August 2022 the MTA convened the Traffic Mobility Review Board, which will oversee congestion pricing and determine </span><span>exact toll rates. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan anticipates that the MTA will begin receiving revenue from congestion </span><span>tolling in the second quarter of 2024. MTA expects to receive $750 million of revenue in 2024 and $1 billion per year </span><span>thereafter.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the State 2020 Budget included legislation authorizing the imposition of sales tax on certain additional </span><span>internet sales and providing that City sales tax revenues in the amount of $127.5 million in State fiscal year 2020 </span><span>(reflecting the portion of the year in which it is effective) and $170 million in State fiscal year 2021 and thereafter </span><span>increasing by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Revenues from such additional </span><span>sales tax are currently estimated to be approximately $170 million per year and are in addition to existing sales taxes </span><span>attributable to certain other internet transactions. Additionally, such legislation provided that State sales tax revenues in </span><span>the amount of $112.5 million in State fiscal year 2020 and $150 million in State fiscal year 2021 and thereafter increasing </span><span>by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. The State 2020 Budget also included </span><span>legislation increasing real estate transfer taxes on properties valued at more than $2 million, which will also be directed </span><span>to the MTA for transit improvements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State 2021 Budget requires the City to contribute $3 billion towards the 2020-2024 Capital Program concurrent with </span><span>the State’s $3 billion contribution. Neither the City nor the State can use operating funds dedicated to the MTA to </span><span>supplant their capital commitment and must pay on a schedule determined by the State Budget Director. The City has </span><span>appropriated this $3 billion and this is anticipated to be spent within the Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State 2021 Budget included a requirement that the City increase its funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating </span><span>deficit from 33% to 50%. The City’s Financial Plan reflects $175 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027 to </span><span>cover the City’s contributions for paratransit services, compared to MTA’s estimates of $223 million, $250 million, $264 </span><span>million and $278 million in fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. The MTA has not released an estimate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>53</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>for fiscal year 2027. Spending on paratransit is significantly impacted by ridership levels, and it is unknown what the </span><span>long-term impacts of COVID-19 will be on usage. The City will continue to monitor the anticipated paratransit costs for </span><span>future years.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Department of Education</span><span>. State law requires the City to provide City funds for the Department of Education (</span><span>“</span><span>DOE</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>each year in an amount not less than the amount appropriated for the preceding fiscal year, excluding amounts for debt </span><span>service and pensions for the DOE. Such City funding must be maintained, unless total City funds for the fiscal year are </span><span>estimated to be lower than in the preceding fiscal year, in which case the mandated City funding for the DOE may be </span><span>reduced by an amount up to the percentage reduction in total City funds.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Judgments and Claims</span><span>. In the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2022, the City expended $1.2 billion for judgments and </span><span>claims, compared to $617.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in judgments and claims paid in </span><span>fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 reflect, in part, payments made relating to a class action lawsuit against the </span><span>Board of Education. The Financial Plan includes provisions for judgments and claims of $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, $877.2 </span><span>million, $823.2 million and $840.2 million for the 2023 through 2027 fiscal years, respectively. These projections </span><span>incorporate a substantial amount of claims costs attributed to NYCHH, estimated to be $140 million in each year of the </span><span>Financial Plan, for which NYCHH reimburses the City unless otherwise forgiven by the City, which was the case in fiscal </span><span>years 2013 and 2016. The City is a party to numerous lawsuits and is the subject of numerous claims and investigations. </span><span>The City has estimated that its potential future liability on account of outstanding claims against it as of June 30, 2022 </span><span>amounted to approximately $7.2 billion. This estimate was made by categorizing the various claims and applying a </span><span>statistical model, based primarily on actual settlements by type of claim during the preceding ten fiscal years, and by </span><span>supplementing the estimated liability with information supplied by the City’s Corporation Counsel.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the above claims, numerous real estate tax certiorari proceedings involving allegations of inequality of </span><span>assessment, illegality and overvaluation are currently pending against the City. The City’s Financial Statements for the </span><span>fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 include an estimate that the City’s liability in the certiorari proceedings, as of June 30, </span><span>2022, could amount to approximately $1.34 billion. Provision has been made in the Financial Plan for estimated refunds </span><span>of $500 million in fiscal year 2023 and $400 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Obligation, Lease and TFA Debt Service</span><span>. Debt service estimates for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 include debt </span><span>service on outstanding general obligation bonds and conduit debt, and the funding requirements associated with </span><span>outstanding TFA Future Tax Secured Bonds, and estimates of debt service costs of, or funding requirements associated </span><span>with, future general obligation, conduit and TFA Future Tax Secured debt issuances based on projected future market </span><span>conditions. Such debt service estimates also include estimated payments pursuant to interest rate exchange agreements </span><span>but do not reflect receipts pursuant to such agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In July 2009, the State amended the New York City Transitional Finance Authority Act to expand the borrowing capacity </span><span>of the TFA by providing that it may have outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax Secured Bonds (excluding Recovery </span><span>Bonds) and may issue additional Future Tax Secured Bonds provided that the amount of such additional bonds, together </span><span>with the amount of indebtedness contracted by the City, does not exceed the debt limit of the City. The City currently </span><span>expects to continue to finance approximately half of its capital program through the TFA, exclusive of Department of </span><span>Environmental Protection (</span><span>“</span><span>DEP</span><span>”</span><span>) capital budget items financed by the Water Authority.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan reflects general obligation debt service of $4.21 billion, $4.43 billion, $4.60 billion, $4.85 billion and </span><span>$5.04 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, conduit debt service of $147 million, $118 million, $117 </span><span>million, $116 million and $115 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, and TFA debt service of $3.30 </span><span>billion, $3.35 billion, $3.63 billion, $4.14 billion and $4.61 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, in each </span><span>case prior to giving effect to prepayments. Such debt service requirements are projected to be below 15% of projected </span><span>City tax revenues for each year of the Financial Plan. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Environmental Matters</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City has more than 500 miles of coastline, bordering the Atlantic Ocean as well as rivers, bays, and inlets. Two of its five </span><span>Boroughs, Manhattan and Staten Island, are islands and water forms the principal boundary of the remaining three. As a </span><span>result, the City is directly affected by rising sea levels and exposed to intensifying coastal storms.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Storms</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On Monday, October 29, 2012, Sandy hit the Mid-Atlantic East Coast. The storm caused widespread damage to the coastal </span><span>and other low lying areas of the City and power failures in various parts of the City, including most of downtown Manhattan. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>54</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>On January 29, 2013, President Obama signed legislation providing for approximately $50.5 billion in storm-related aid for the </span><span>region affected by the storm. Although it is not possible for the City to quantify the full, long-term impact of the storm on the </span><span>City and its economy, the current estimate of the direct costs to the City, NYCHH and NYCHA is approximately $10.7 billion </span><span>(comprised of approximately $1.8 billion of expense costs and approximately $8.9 billion of capital project costs). Such direct </span><span>costs represent funding for emergency response, debris removal, emergency protective measures, repair of damaged </span><span>infrastructure and long-term hazard mitigation investments. In addition to such direct costs, the City is delivering Sandy-related</span><span> disaster recovery assistance services, benefiting impacted communities, businesses, homeowners and renters </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Community Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). The City anticipates that funding for Community Costs will be primarily reimbursed with federal funds. </span><span>However, the City is responsible for $134 million of such Community Costs, which are reflected in the Financial Plan. In </span><span>addition, the City may be responsible for up to approximately $150 million of additional Community Costs, which are not </span><span>reflected in the Financial Plan.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Financial Plan assumes that the direct costs described above will largely be paid from non-City sources, primarily the </span><span>federal government, and that the Community Costs described above will be primarily reimbursed by federal funds. The City </span><span>expects reimbursements to come from two separate federal sources of funding, FEMA and HUD. The City has secured </span><span>approximately $10.7 billion in FEMA assistance and other federal emergency response grants (</span><span>“</span><span>FEMA Funding</span><span>”</span><span>). The </span><span>maximum reimbursement rate from FEMA is 90% of total costs. Other federal emergency response grants may have larger </span><span>local share percentages. The City expects to use $720 million of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery </span><span>funding allocated by HUD to meet the local share requirements of the FEMA funding, as well as recovery work not funded by </span><span>FEMA or other federal sources. This allocation would be available to fill gaps in such FEMA funding. As of June 30, 2022, the </span><span>City, NYCHH and NYCHA have received $4.5 billion in reimbursements from FEMA for the direct costs described above. In </span><span>addition to the FEMA Funding described above, HUD has made available over $4.4 billion for Community Costs, of which </span><span>approximately $3.8 billion has been received through June 30, 2022. No assurance can be given that the City will be </span><span>reimbursed for all of its costs or that such reimbursements will be received within the time periods assumed in the Financial </span><span>Plan. There is no assurance, if the City were to experience a similar storm in the future, that non-City sources, including the </span><span>federal government, would pay the costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On September 1, 2021, Hurricane Ida hit the Mid-Atlantic East Coast as a post-tropical cyclone (</span><span>“</span><span>Ida</span><span>”</span><span>), bringing significant </span><span>rainfall and resulting in severe flooding in parts of the City, including inland areas. Rainfall from Ida exceeded the previous </span><span>record for the most single-hour rainfall in the City and for the first time the National Weather Service declared a flash flood </span><span>emergency in the City. Ida resulted in the deaths of 13 people in the City, 11 of which occurred in basement housing units. On </span><span>September 3, 2021, former Mayor de Blasio announced a climate-driven rain response plan, which includes developing </span><span>improved storm warning systems and the creation of the Extreme Weather Response Taskforce composed of representatives </span><span>from several different City agencies, including DEP, the Department of Transportation, Emergency Management and the </span><span>Department of Sanitation. On September 27, 2021, the taskforce released its report, The New Normal: Combating Storm-Related</span><span> Extreme Weather in New York City. The report’s recommendations, among others, include (i) improvements to </span><span>emergency preparedness and response, (ii) protecting occupants of basement apartments and (iii) expediting both short-term</span><span> and long-term investments in infrastructure, including sewers and prevention of flooding in inland communities. The </span><span>total costs of implementing all of the report’s recommendations would be substantial and in some cases would require State </span><span>and federal funding. In response to the report, in October 2021, the City added approximately $2 billion to its capital plan to </span><span>support the report’s recommendations, most of which is in DEP’s capital budget to be funded by the City’s water and sewer </span><span>system through bonds issued by the City’s Water Authority. Such additional funding continues to be reflected in the </span><span>Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy. The City continues to review the effects of climate change, including increased climate </span><span>drive rain. The extent to which funding to cover recommendations put forth by the report will be available from State or </span><span>federal sources is not known at this time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate Change</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Since 2007, the City has been engaged in strategic planning for climate change, recognizing the challenges it presents for City </span><span>operations and infrastructure. Among other things, the City created the New York City Panel on Climate Change (the </span><span>“</span><span>NPCC</span><span>”</span><span>), a body of more than a dozen leading independent climate and social scientists. Since 2008, NPCC has analyzed </span><span>climate trends, developed projections, explored key impacts, issued reports (the </span><span>“</span><span>NPCC Reports</span><span>”</span><span>) and advised on response </span><span>strategies for the City. The NPCC has determined that the City is already experiencing the impacts of climate change and </span><span>projects dramatic impacts on the City in the future. Climate change is causing more extreme heat, extreme rainfall, coastal </span><span>storm surge, and chronic tidal flooding. NPCC projections form the basis for the City’s climate resiliency planning, which </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>55</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>involves coordination and cooperation among multiple public and private stakeholders, and expansion of ongoing </span><span>maintenance and development of municipal infrastructure as well as specific initiatives such as those described below.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Building on NPCC’s recommendations and the City’s strategic planning, the City is in the process of implementing </span><span>infrastructure projects to protect the City from the effects of extreme rainfall, addressing some of the risks identified in the </span><span>NPCC Reports. In addition, the City is pursuing heat mitigation strategies. These projects and initiatives are in various stages </span><span>of feasibility review, design and construction and implementation. Funding for these projects is expected to come from City, </span><span>State and federal sources. Some projects are expected to require additional funding to the extent that they are in the planning </span><span>stages or current funding does not provide for the costs of construction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Several major coastal resiliency projects are currently underway throughout the City, including the East Side Coastal </span><span>Resiliency Project (</span><span>“</span><span>ESCR</span><span>”</span><span>). ESCR, which broke ground in 2021, is an integrated coastal flood protection system which will </span><span>create resilient open spaces and improve waterfront access on Manhattan’s east side, from East 25th Street at the north to </span><span>Montgomery Street at the south. The City anticipates the entire flood protection system will be in place and operational by </span><span>the end of 2026. The total expected cost of ESCR is $1.97 billion, with remaining costs fully funded through a combination of </span><span>City, federal and other funding.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (</span><span>“</span><span>USACE</span><span>”</span><span>) is pursuing the South Shore of Staten Island Coastal Storm Risk Management </span><span>Project (the </span><span>“</span><span>Staten Island Project</span><span>”</span><span>) and the Rockaways Shorefront and Back Bay Projects (the </span><span>“</span><span>Rockaways Project</span><span>”</span><span>). The </span><span>Staten Island Project will create a 5.5-mile line of coastal protection on Staten Island between Fort Wadsworth and Oakwood </span><span>Beach. USACE currently estimates that the project will cost $1.7 billion. The City is responsible for 10.5% of the project costs, </span><span>and the remaining project costs are to be paid for with federal and State funds. Approximately half of the City’s share of such </span><span>project costs is currently reflected in the Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy. The Rockaways Project consists of coastal </span><span>protection elements on the Atlantic shorefront and on the Jamaica Bay side of the Rockaways. Construction has begun on the </span><span>project, which will be fully funded by the federal government, with an expected cost of approximately $590 million.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other projects in Lower Manhattan include constructing flood walls and deployable flip-up barriers to protect the Two </span><span>Bridges neighborhood, which lies south of Montgomery Street at the north to the Brooklyn Bridge at the south, developing a </span><span>plan that contemplates extending the Manhattan shoreline from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Battery into the East River to </span><span>protect the Seaport and Financial District area, and constructing an elevated waterfront esplanade in the Battery and flood </span><span>barriers in Battery Park City. Coastal resilience projects are also underway in the Tottenville, Red Hook, and Hunts Point </span><span>neighborhoods, with shoreline reinforcement projects happening in other identified areas of the City. These projects are in </span><span>various stages of feasibility review, design and construction and implementation. Funding for these projects is coming from </span><span>City and federal sources. While the full cost of these projects is not yet known, $522 million is included in the Preliminary </span><span>Ten-Year Capital Strategy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to site-specific resiliency projects, the City is taking steps to integrate climate resiliency into capital planning </span><span>through the NYC Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines, which translate future-looking climate change projections into </span><span>technical guidance to inform the design of roads, buildings, sewer systems, hospitals, public housing, and other pieces of </span><span>critical public infrastructure. In 2021, the City began a five-year pilot program through which dozens of new projects will be </span><span>designed and constructed using the standards in the NYC Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines. By 2026, all City projects will </span><span>be required to meet a stringent set of requirements that will certify their preparedness for extreme weather threats.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reducing risk from extreme rainfall requires a multi-layered strategy with investments in infrastructure adaptation, building </span><span>level protection, data collection, and community engagement. In July 2022, the City released the Rainfall Ready NYC action </span><span>plan, a plan to prepare the City for more extreme rainfall in the future. The City continues to install grey infrastructure, such </span><span>as building out a comprehensive storm sewer system in Southeast Queens, and green infrastructure, such as rain gardens </span><span>and bluebelt wetlands, to manage stormwater and protect water quality. This work is being carried out by DEP and funding is </span><span>included in the City’s capital budget. The City is also working to develop Cloudburst management projects that will use grey </span><span>and green infrastructure to absorb, store and transfer rainwater.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In 2015, FEMA issued preliminary updated flood insurance rate maps, which would have expanded the 100-year floodplain </span><span>beyond the areas designated in the flood maps issued in 2007. The City appealed the 2015 preliminary flood maps </span><span>challenging the modeling FEMA used to develop them. The 2015 preliminary flood maps were adopted into the building </span><span>code, but the prior 2007 flood maps remain in effect for flood insurance purposes. In 2016, FEMA agreed with the City’s </span><span>appeal, and the City is currently working with FEMA to update the maps. FEMA’s new maps are expected to generally expand </span><span>the 100-year floodplain from the 2007 flood maps and may cover different areas than the 2015 preliminary flood maps. Such </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>56</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>expansion could negatively impact property values in those newly designated areas. In addition, an increase in areas of the </span><span>City susceptible to flooding resulting from climate change could result in greater recovery costs to the City if flooding were to </span><span>occur within such larger areas.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The City is also committed to minimizing its own greenhouse gas emissions by reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. The City’s </span><span>efforts to reach such goal include promoting and investing in electrification, clean energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable </span><span>transportation, and reducing energy use. Since 2014, the City has invested over $700 million in more than 10,300 energy </span><span>conservation measures across almost 2,000 buildings, comprising more than 70 percent of City government’s building </span><span>square footage. The investments have decreased energy use and reduced emissions by nearly 266,000 metric tons. The </span><span>Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy includes $4.4 billion to continue this work to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas </span><span>emissions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the efforts described above, the magnitude of the impact on the City’s operations, economy, or financial condition </span><span>from climate change is indeterminate and unpredictable. No assurance can be given that the City will not encounter natural </span><span>disaster risks, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, heatwaves or catastrophic sea level rise in the future, or that such risks will </span><span>not have an adverse effect on the operations, economy or financial condition of the City.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The City relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of </span><span>personal, private or sensitive information, the City and its agencies and offices face multiple cyber threats including, but not </span><span>limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computers and other sensitive digital networks and systems. The </span><span>City’s Office of Cyber Command (</span><span>“</span><span>Cyber Command</span><span>”</span><span>), which was created in 2017, is charged with setting information </span><span>security policies and standards for the City, directing the City’s citywide cyber defense and incident response, deploying </span><span>defensive technical and administrative controls and providing guidance to the Mayor and City agencies on cyber defense. In </span><span>January 2022, Cyber Command became part of the City’s Office of Technology and Innovation (</span><span>“</span><span>OTI</span><span>”</span><span>) (formerly the </span><span>Department of Information Technology and telecommunications).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cyber Command has over 100 full-time employees and works with designated cybersecurity contacts at each City agency as </span><span>part of the Citywide Cybersecurity Program. The Financial Plan reflects funding for Cyber Command of $122 million in fiscal </span><span>year 2023, $121 million in fiscal year 2024 and $122 million in each of fiscal years 2025 through 2027. Such funding does not </span><span>account for cybersecurity funding at other City agencies. Cyber Command is built around two core cybersecurity functions: </span><span>(1) threat management, which manages incident response and cyber threat intelligence and vulnerability management, </span><span>which helps agencies prioritize remediation efforts on identified unpatched systems in the City’s networks; and (2) security </span><span>sciences, which manages strategic and tactical cyber defense technologies and initiatives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In carrying out its functions, Cyber Command works with a range of City, State, and federal law enforcement agencies, </span><span>including the New York City Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. In </span><span>February 2022, the City and the State, along with the mayors of Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers, unveiled </span><span>the Joint Security Operations Center. The center should enhance coordination of cybersecurity efforts across the State, </span><span>helping to foster collaboration among city, State, and federal entities. Cyber Command also regularly works with other states </span><span>and municipalities throughout the country to share cybersecurity threat intelligence and best practices, as well as with non-governmental</span><span> entities such as utilities, telecommunications providers and financial services companies for the purpose of </span><span>enhancing collective cyber defenses. The City has developed standard cybersecurity policies and standards for third party </span><span>vendors of the City to follow, and security provisions for contracts with vendors, which help ensure that the City is notified of </span><span>cyber breaches and suspected cyber breaches of a vendor’s network environment. The City has also developed a Citywide </span><span>Incident Response Policy, which requires City agencies to develop incident response plans in accordance with Cyber </span><span>Command policies and standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While the City conducts periodic tests and reviews of its networks, no assurances can be given that such security and </span><span>operational control measures will be successful in guarding against all cyber threats and attacks. New technical cyber </span><span>vulnerabilities are discovered in the United States daily. In addition, cyber attacks have become more sophisticated and </span><span>increasingly are capable of impacting municipal control systems and components. The techniques used to obtain </span><span>unauthorized access to, or to disable or degrade, electronic networks, computers, systems and solutions are rapidly evolving </span><span>and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. In addition, there is heightened risk due to an increase in remote </span><span>access to City systems by City employees as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19. As cybersecurity threats continue to </span><span>evolve, the City may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen security </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The </span><span>results of any successful attack on the City’s computer and information technology systems could impact its operations and </span><span>damage the City’s digital networks and systems, and the costs of remedying any such damage could be substantial. </span><span>Consistent with the City’s general policy to self-insure, the City does not carry insurance against cyber attacks.</span></div> <div> <div><span>On Saturday, June 5, 2021, Cyber Command detected unusual activity on one server located within the City Law </span><span>Department’s information technology systems and promptly determined, with the assistance of the Law Department, a third-party</span><span> had accessed the server in an unauthorized manner. Consistent with the City’s Cybersecurity Incident Response </span><span>protocols, Cyber Command, OTI, and the Law Department took immediate action to contain the server, identify any </span><span>additional impacted systems and contain such systems, and engaged in various defensive measures to address the </span><span>unauthorized activity, including, without limitation, temporarily disabling remote access capability to the Law Department’s </span><span>network and blocking incoming connections from the remote access systems. The disabling and blocking resulted in the </span><span>inability of Law Department employees to remotely access the Law Department network, although such employees could </span><span>continue to access the network while present at the Law Department's offices. Such disabling and blocking remained in </span><span>effect as the City implemented certain security measures which led to continued business interruption. Due to certain COVID </span><span>restrictions and the remote nature of certain Law Department work, the inability to access the network remotely led to </span><span>temporary, significant business interruption. Beginning on September 13, 2021, all mayoral agency employees, including Law </span><span>Department employees, have returned to full in-person work. With the replacement of components and system upgrades, full </span><span>functionality of the Law Department’s computer network is substantially complete. Cyber Command’s investigation has </span><span>found no evidence of data exfiltration or unauthorized encryption of City information technology systems or the presence of </span><span>ransomware.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The DOE investigated a cybersecurity incident at Illuminate Education (</span><span>“</span><span>Illuminate</span><span>”</span><span>), a third-party vendor that provided </span><span>cloud-based services to some DOE schools. Illuminate advised DOE that between December 28, 2021 and January 8, 2022, </span><span>certain of Illuminate’s databases that contained confidential student information were subject to unauthorized access. </span><span>Illuminate has stated that no financial account information or social security numbers were affected in this incident, and no </span><span>DOE computer systems were affected. DOE directed all schools to cease using any Illuminate products and services after June </span><span>30, 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Reports</span><span>. Set forth below are summaries of the most recent reports of the City Comptroller, OSDC and the staff of the </span><span>Control Board. These summaries do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On March 6, 2023, the City Comptroller released a report entitled </span><span>“</span><span>Comments on New York City’s Preliminary Budget for </span><span>Fiscal Year 2024 and the Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 2023-2027</span><span>”</span><span>. The report states that the City’s fiscal outlook differs </span><span>significantly from that depicted in the Financial Plan, for three main reasons. First, a tentative contract agreement was </span><span>announced between DC 37 and the City with annual raises of 3 percent for the first four years and 3.25 percent for the fifth </span><span>year – higher than the 1.25 percent annual raises funded in the Financial Plan. If this were to be the pattern for all other </span><span>unions, it would add costs to the Financial Plan of $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2023, $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2024, $3.4 billion in </span><span>fiscal year 2025, $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2026, and $4.7 billion in fiscal year 2027 for a total of $16.3 billion. Second, the cost </span><span>for shelter and services provided to asylum seekers is escalating. The Financial Plan assumed the annual cost to be $1 billion </span><span>in fiscal year 2023 and zero in fiscal year 2024 and beyond, and also assumed these costs would be covered in full by federal </span><span>aid. By February 7, 2023, City Hall had projected the cumulative cost for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024 would be $4.2 </span><span>billion. State and federal aid are currently projected to cover only one-quarter of that amount. Third, the Governor’s Executive </span><span>Budget includes $1 billion in cost shifts, unfunded mandates, and revenue cuts just in fiscal year 2024. Additional, significant </span><span>costs could derive from the Governor’s proposals regarding charter schools. The cost of implementing the State’s class size </span><span>mandate legislation enacted in 2022, which requires the City to reduce class size in its schools over the next five years, also </span><span>remains unfunded.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The report incorporates an updated forecast of economic conditions and City revenues. This forecast reflects the economic </span><span>resiliency in response to tighter monetary policy shown so far, and an outlook predicated on an economic </span><span>“</span><span>soft-landing</span><span>”</span><span>. The </span><span>analysis also incorporates up-to-date information on the City’s property tax, not included in the Financial Plan. The City </span><span>Comptroller’s net revenue projections are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $1.38 billion, $2.32 billion, $1.90 </span><span>billion, $2.19 billion, and $3.61 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. The report projects that: (i) property tax </span><span>revenues will be higher by $177 million, $577 million, $730 million, $1.21 billion and $2.54 billion in fiscal years 2023 through </span><span>2027, respectively; (ii) personal income tax revenues will be higher by $193 million, $632 million, $509 million, $654 million </span><span>and $973 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iii) business tax revenues will be higher by $180 million and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>58</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>$27 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, but lower by $152 million, $21 million and $59 million in fiscal years </span><span>2025 through 2027, respectively; (iv) sales tax revenues will be higher by $202 million, $525 million, $390 million, $133 </span><span>million and $26 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (v) real estate transaction-related tax revenues will be </span><span>higher by $60 million, $305 million and $126 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2025, respectively, and lower by $105 million </span><span>and $195 million in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, respectively; (vi) other tax revenue will be higher by $47 million, $14 million, </span><span>$54 million, $88 million and $94 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; and (vii) revenues from audit </span><span>collections will be higher by $579 million in fiscal year 2023 and $179 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Despite the revised revenue projection, the City Comptroller projects additional net risks of $1.3 billion, $1.51 billion, $3.90 </span><span>billion, $5.21 billion and $5.20 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, which, when added to the results </span><span>projected in the Financial Plan would result in gaps of $1.30 billion, $1.51 billion, $7.07 billion, $10.22 billion and $11.66 billion </span><span>in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. Such gaps do not include risks associated with costs of providing services to </span><span>asylum seekers: $823 million and $2.18 billion in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, and potentially $2.8 billion in each </span><span>fiscal year thereafter. The differences from the Financial Plan projections result in part from the City Comptroller’s net </span><span>expenditure projections, which are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $2.68 billion, $3.83 billion, $5.81 billion, </span><span>$7.40 billion and $8.81 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, as a result of: (i) additional overtime </span><span>expenditures of $651 million and $563 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $440 million in each of fiscal </span><span>years 2025 through 2027; (ii) increased expenditures related to education related risks of $255 million, $856 million, $1.07 </span><span>billion, $1.95 billion and $2.63 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iii) increased expenditures to fund the </span><span>Fire Department’s mental health response program of $37 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (iv) increased </span><span>public assistance costs of $125 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2026; (v) increased expenditures associated with </span><span>rental assistance of $237 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (vi) increased costs of contributions to MTA of </span><span>$74 million, $125 million, $271 million, $445 million and $492 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (vii) </span><span>increased expenditures associated with paying prevailing wage rates for homeless shelter security guards of $64 million in </span><span>each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (viii) increased expenditures associated with the State’s foster care reimbursement </span><span>rate of $47 million in fiscal year 2023 and $118 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (ix) an increased </span><span>expenditure of $82 million in fiscal year 2024 relating to a class action settlement on behalf of former detainees whose </span><span>releases had been delayed after posting bail; (x) increased expenditures of $84 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through </span><span>2027 for court-appointed counsel; (xi) increased expenditures of $194 million in fiscal year 2024 for temporary and </span><span>professional services; (xii) increased expenditures for Public Health Corps of $13 million in fiscal year 2025 and $49 million in </span><span>each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027; and (xiii) increased expenditures for collective bargaining agreements of $2.50 billion, </span><span>$1.80 billion, $3.40 billion, $3.90 billion and $4.70 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, if other unions follow </span><span>the DC 37 tentative contract settlement. The report also projects: (i) anticipated debt service savings from lower interest rates </span><span>on variable rate bonds of $60 million in fiscal year 2023 and $50 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (ii) </span><span>decreased expenditures of $285 million and $48 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, relating to enhanced </span><span>federal Medicaid assistance; and (iii) anticipated personal services accrual savings due to vacancies of $714 million and $357 </span><span>million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On March 6, 2023, the City Comptroller released a report relating to vacancies in City government agencies, as a follow-up to </span><span>the City Comptroller’s report relating to vacancies released on December 6, 2022.

The </span><span>report identifies MMR outcomes for City agencies with the highest vacancy rates identified in the December 2022 report, and </span><span>also identifies Units of Appropriation with low MMR indicator performance and high vacancy rates. The report found that, </span><span>among the fifteen agencies with the highest vacancy rates highlighted in the prior report, the Department of Small Business </span><span>Services stands out as an agency that is particularly struggling to meet performance metrics. The Department of Health and </span><span>Mental Hygiene, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the Department of City Planning are also, </span><span>the report found, consistently failing to meet or improve on the goals self-identified as critical. The City Comptroller’s office </span><span>recommends in the report that the City should modernize hiring and retention practices, including by expediting hiring, </span><span>allowing hybrid work for appropriate positions, reconsidering compensation levels for key hard-to-recruit slots, and </span><span>designating a Chief Talent/Recruitment/Retention Officer to drive this work.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On February 23, 2023, the OSDC released a report entitled </span><span>“</span><span>Review of the Financial Plan of the City of New York.</span><span>”</span><span> The report </span><span>states that the City’s preliminary fiscal year 2024 budget, adjusted for prepayments for future expenses, reflects better-than-projected</span><span> revenue collections, the allocation of federal pandemic relief funds and the accumulated impact of savings </span><span>initiatives.

The report notes that the City’s economic forecast, as reflected in the Financial Plan, shows a slowdown in the </span><span>City’s economy in 2023 commensurate with consensus expectation of a slowing national economy as Federal Reserve </span><span>interest rate hikes course through the economy. The Control Board projects larger budget gaps than those in the Financial </span><span>Plan. Such projected gaps are driven by the Control Board’s estimates of higher expenditures, chief of which is the additional </span><span>cost of collective bargaining above the amount budgeted in the labor reserve. The report notes that the City’s capital program </span><span>will require an increasing portion of the City’s tax revenues to pay debt service expenses, which is projected to reach 14.9 </span><span>percent and 14.8 percent in fiscal years 2032 and 2033, respectively, closely approaching the 15 percent affordability level </span><span>determined by the City.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Control Board report identified estimated net risks to the Financial Plan of $1.02 billion, $4.24 billion, $4.84 billion, $5.61 </span><span>billion and $6.68 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, resulting in budget gaps of $1.02 billion, $4.24 billion, </span><span>$8.01 billion, $10.63 billion and $13.15 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. Such net risks result from: (i) </span><span>increases in property tax revenues of $206 million, $291 million, $433 million, $562 million and $562 million in fiscal years </span><span>2023 through 2027, respectively; (ii) increases in non property tax revenues of $1.24 billion, $1.24 billion, $1.26 billion, $1.29 </span><span>billion and $1.32 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iii) increases in non-tax revenues of $65 million in </span><span>fiscal year 2023 and $150 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (iv) increased expenditures relating to collective </span><span>bargaining agreements of $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </span><span>respectively; (v) increases in uniformed services overtime expenses of $461 million, $697 million, $699 million, $702 million </span><span>and $702 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (vi) increased expenditures associated with increases in </span><span>charter school tuition rates of $81 million, $133 million, $313 million and $514 million in fiscal years 2024 through 2027, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>60</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

As of December 31, 2022, approximately $39.32 billion of City general </span><span>obligation bonds were outstanding.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currently, the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>HYIC</span><span>”</span><span>) has outstanding approximately $2.55 billion aggregate </span><span>principal amount of bonds. In addition, HYIC has entered into a term loan facility with Bank of America, N.A. pursuant to </span><span>which HYIC may draw up to an aggregate amount of $380 million, approximately $9.9 million of which has been drawn. The </span><span>term loan facility has a scheduled maturity of June 30, 2027. HYIC expects to issue bonds to repay such term loan facility or </span><span>further extend the maturity date prior to the scheduled maturity. The bonds financed the extension of the Number 7 subway </span><span>line and other public improvements in the Hudson Yards area, and the term loan will be used to finance any remaining costs </span><span>of completion of the original project and the expansion of the park in the Hudson Yards area. HYIC’s bonds and, on a </span><span>subordinate basis, draws under the term loan facility are secured by and payable from payments in lieu of taxes and other </span><span>revenues generated by development in the Hudson Yards area. To the extent payments in lieu of taxes and other HYIC </span><span>revenues are insufficient to pay interest on the HYIC bonds or the term loan, the City has agreed to pay the amount of any </span><span>shortfall in interest, subject to appropriation. The Financial Plan does not reflect the need for such interest support payments. </span><span>The City has no obligation to pay the principal of such bonds or of such term loan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Water and Sewer</span><span>. The City’s financing program includes the issuance of water and sewer revenue bonds by the Water </span><span>Authority which is authorized to issue bonds to finance capital investment in the City’s water and sewer system. Pursuant to </span><span>State law, debt service on Water Authority indebtedness is secured by water and sewer fees paid by users of the water and </span><span>sewer system. Such fees are revenues of the Water Board, which holds a lease interest in the City’s water and sewer system. </span><span>After providing for debt service on obligations of the Water Authority and certain incidental costs, the revenues of the Water </span><span>Board are paid to the City to cover the City’s costs of operating the water and sewer system and as rental for the system. In </span><span>fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the City did not request the rental payment due to the City from the Water Board. In fiscal </span><span>years 2020 and 2021, on account of the outbreak of COVID-19, the City requested rental payments of $128 million and $137 </span><span>million, respectively. The Financial Plan reflects no additional rental payment requests for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. The </span><span>City’s Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy applicable to the City’s water and sewer system covering fiscal years 2024 </span><span>through 2033, projects City-funded water and sewer investment (which is expected to be financed with proceeds of Water </span><span>Authority debt) at approximately $29.0 billion. The 2023 2027 Capital Commitment Plan reflects total anticipated City-funded </span><span>water and sewer commitments of $15.5 billion which are expected to be financed with the proceeds of Water Authority debt.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>New York City Transitional Finance Authority</span><span>. The TFA is authorized to have outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax Secured </span><span>Bonds (excluding Recovery Bonds). The TFA may have outstanding Future Tax Secured Bonds in excess of $13.5 billion </span><span>provided that the amount of the Future Tax Secured Bonds, together with the amount of indebtedness contracted by the City, </span><span>do not exceed the debt limit of the City. Future Tax Secured Bonds are issued for general City capital purposes and are </span><span>secured by the City’s personal income tax revenues and, to the extent such revenues do not satisfy specified debt ratios, sales </span><span>tax revenues. In addition, the TFA is authorized to have outstanding $9.4 billion of Building Aid Revenue Bonds to pay for a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>61</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>portion of the City’s five-year educational facilities capital plan. Building Aid Revenue Bonds are secured by State building aid, </span><span>which the Mayor has assigned to the TFA.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Implementation of the financing program is dependent upon the ability of the City and other financing entities to market </span><span>their securities successfully in the public credit markets which will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the times of </span><span>sale. No assurance can be given that the credit markets will absorb the projected amounts of public bond sales. A significant </span><span>portion of bond financing is used to reimburse the City’s General Fund for capital expenditures already incurred. If the City </span><span>and such other entities are unable to sell such amounts of bonds, it would have an adverse effect on the City’s cash position. </span><span>In addition, the need of the City to fund future debt service costs from current operations may also limit the City’s capital </span><span>program. The Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2024 through 2033 totals $159.3 billion, of which </span><span>approximately 97.5% is to be financed with funds borrowed by the City and such other entities. Congressional developments </span><span>affecting federal taxation generally could reduce the market value of tax-favored investments and increase the debt-service </span><span>costs of carrying out the major portion of the City’s capital plan which is currently eligible for tax-exempt financing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NEW YORK STATE</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>New York is the fourth most populous state in the nation, after California, Texas, and Florida, and has a relatively high level of </span><span>personal wealth. The State’s economy is diverse, with a comparatively large share of the nation’s financial activities, </span><span>information, education, and health services employment, and a small share of the nation’s farming and mining activity. The </span><span>State’s location, air transport facilities and natural harbors have made it an important hub for international commerce. Travel </span><span>and tourism constitute an important part of the economy. Like the rest of the nation, New York has a declining proportion of </span><span>its workforce engaged in manufacturing and an increasing proportion engaged in service industries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Manufacturing employment continues to stagnate as a share of total State nonfarm employment, as in most other states, </span><span>and as a result New York’s economy is less reliant on this sector than in the past. However, it remains an important sector of </span><span>the State economy, particularly for the upstate region, which hosts higher concentrations of manufacturers. As defined under </span><span>the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the trade, transportation, and utilities supersector accounts for </span><span>the third largest component of State nonfarm employment, but only the fifth largest when measured by wage share. This </span><span>sector accounts for proportionally less employment and wages for the State than for the nation. New York City is the nation’s </span><span>leading center of banking and finance. For this reason, this is far more important for the State than for the nation. Although </span><span>this sector accounts for less than one-tenth of all nonfarm jobs in the State, it contributes more than one-fifth of total wages. </span><span>The remaining service-producing sectors include information, professional and business services, private education and </span><span>healthcare, leisure and hospitality services, and other services. When combined, these industries account for over half of all </span><span>nonfarm jobs in New York. Information, education and health, and other services account for a higher proportion of total </span><span>State employment than for the nation. Farming is an important part of the State’s rural economy, although it constitutes less </span><span>than 0.2 percent of total State GDP. According to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, New York </span><span>ranked in the top ten in the production of 30 commodities in 2020. Notably, the State was the second-largest producer of </span><span>apples, snap beans, and maple syrup. The State was also the third-largest producer of cabbage, grapes, and dairy, which </span><span>represented the largest segment of the State’s agricultural sector that year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Federal, State, and local governments together comprise the second largest sector in terms of nonfarm jobs. Public education </span><span>is the source of over 40 percent of total State and local government employment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Annual Information Statement</span><span>. The Annual Information Statement, dated June 29, 2022 (the </span><span>“</span><span>AIS</span><span>”</span><span>), reflects the State’s </span><span>Enacted Budget Financial Plan (the </span><span>“</span><span>Enacted Budget Financial Plan</span><span>”</span><span>) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and sets forth the State’s </span><span>official Financial Plan projections for Fiscal Year 2023 through Fiscal Year 2027 (the </span><span>“</span><span>Financial Plan period</span><span>”</span><span>).

The General Fund receipts forecast, excluding PTET related revisions, is reduced </span><span>by almost $1.3 billion in the current year, followed by upward revisions to projections of $1.2 billion in FY 2024, $609 million in </span><span>FY 2025, $411 million in FY 2026, and $317 million in FY 2027 compared to the Executive Budget Financial Plan. The FY 2023 </span><span>and FY 2024 revisions are offset by the Transaction Risk Reserve and the set aside of $800 million consistent with the </span><span>consensus revenue forecast agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>PIT receipts have been revised to reflect higher projected withholding ($550 million in both FY 2023 and FY 2024; $170 </span><span>million in later years). In FY 2023, the higher withholding is offset by a downward adjustment to estimated extensions ($2.45 </span><span>billion) for a net reduction totaling $1.9 billion.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other revisions include higher bank tax collections associated with the resolution of a large audit and growth in investment </span><span>income consistent with rising interest rates. In addition, the estimate for mobile sports wagering receipts has been increased </span><span>in all years based on updated collections experience. The additional mobile sports wagering receipts collected in FY 2023 will </span><span>be transferred to the General Fund beginning in FY 2024 to support education.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan maintains a Transaction Risk Reserve to guard against unexpected declines in receipts or costs </span><span>related to transaction risk execution. Accordingly, the Transaction Risk Reserve is used to offset the $1.3 billion downward </span><span>revision to the receipts forecast in the current year. In FY 2024, the Transaction Risk Reserve will be increased by $436 million.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>PTET Related Receipts Revisions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the Executive Budget Financial Plan, the State recognized higher personal income tax collections. However, based on </span><span>updated information from the Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF), a portion ($2.45 billion) of the higher collections </span><span>are projected to be due to delayed claims of PTET credits and has been set aside for PTET. Other PTET related revisions </span><span>include an upward revision to PIT refunds ($1 billion in FY 2023 and $2 billion in FY 2024) to reflect the delayed credits that </span><span>are expected to be paid at the end of the year and through FY 2024, which is partly offset by revisions to estimated payments </span><span>and other adjustments totaling $400 million. In FY 2023, the PTET reserve is increased by $1.85 billion and will be mostly </span><span>used in FY 2024 to support expected refund payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive Summary</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State’s Financial Rebound from COVID-19</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the decade between the Great Recession and the onset of COVID, the New York economy steadily expanded. The State’s </span><span>gross product grew at 4.4 percent annually and total employment increased by nearly 1.4 million. State finances were stable, </span><span>with State Operating Funds spending increasing at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent. Tax collections, which fund roughly </span><span>three- quarters of State Operating Funds spending, grew at a yearly average of just under 3.8 percent, reaching a </span><span>“</span><span>pre-COVID</span><span>”</span><span> peak in FY 2020, rising by nearly 10 percent over FY 2019.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>63</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The onset of the COVID pandemic in New York, which coincided with the start of the State’s 2021 fiscal year, triggered </span><span>sweeping public health measures at the State and local levels to slow the spread of the virus. Economic activity slowed </span><span>dramatically, unemployment spiked, and the State prepared for a prolonged economic downturn. State spending, adjusted </span><span>for the timing of payments, flattened.</span></div> <div> <div><span>State finances, however, have fared better than expected. In FY 2021, during the acute phase of the pandemic, tax collections </span><span>declined by just 0.6 percent from FY 2020, bolstered by Federal economic stimulus — and have subsequently soared. In FY </span><span>2022, tax collections grew by 27 percent, which is equal to about seven years of typical tax receipts growth compressed into </span><span>a single year. In FY 2023, collections are expected to increase by nearly 10 percent to total almost $115 billion, or over $32 </span><span>billion higher than FY 2021 results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In October 2021, Governor Hochul committed to building the State’s reserves to ensure that it could honor its current </span><span>commitments through good and bad times. The extraordinary gains in tax receipts have been directed to accomplish that </span><span>purpose. By the end of FY 2023, the State will have boosted its reserves by over $20 billion since FY 2020. It will have also </span><span>prepaid over $10 billion in future debt service costs that were due in FY 2024 through FY 2027.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Post-COVID-19 Expansion is Ending</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Yet even as tax receipts continue to show strength in the current year, DOB has downgraded its expectations for the </span><span>economic outlook twice since the FY 2023 Enacted Budget Financial Plan was published in May 2022, first in the First </span><span>Quarterly Update to the Financial Plan and again in the Updated Financial Plan. It is now forecasting a mild national recession </span><span>in calendar year 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At the State level, key economic drivers of tax receipts have been revised sharply downward. Total wage growth is now </span><span>expected to slow to 2.8 percent in FY 2023 and 2.3 percent in FY 2024, compared to 3.3 percent and 4.3 percent in the May </span><span>2022 forecast. Bonus income is expected to decline by 27 percent in FY 2024 from the FY 2022 peak. In comparison, the </span><span>Enacted Budget forecast called for a 15.5 percent decline in bonus income in FY 2023 followed by growth of 3.5 percent in FY </span><span>2024.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beginning in FY 2024, the weakening economic activity is expected to start becoming apparent in tax collections (which are a </span><span>lagging indicator of changing economic activity). This is expected to carry through the following years of the Financial Plan, </span><span>with the most pronounced impact on FY 2025 and FY 2026 operations. General Fund tax receipts, before proposed actions in </span><span>the FY 2024 Executive Budget, have been reduced by $2.1 billion in FY 2024, $7.4 billion in FY 2025, $7.8 billion in FY 2026, </span><span>and $5.2 billion in FY 2027 in comparison to the Enacted Budget Financial Plan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>FY 2024 Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Governor introduced the FY 2024 Executive Budget on February 1, 2023 and submitted amendments on March 3, 2023. </span><span>DOB estimates that the General Fund will be balanced on a cash basis in FY 2024, if the Legislature adopts the Governor’s </span><span>proposal without modification. The FY 2024 Executive Budget fully funds existing commitments, including the third and final </span><span>year of the Foundation Aid phase-in. By the end of School Year (SY) 2024, Foundation Aid will have increased by $5.7 billion </span><span>since SY 2021. DOB expects the General Fund to end FY 2024 with a balance of $35.7 billion, with principal reserves intact.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Three of the most pressing issues facing the State at the start of 2023 are addressed in the FY 2024 Executive Budget: the </span><span>solvency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the stability of the State’s health care system, and the </span><span>provision of care for thousands of new asylum seekers coming to the State. In response to these challenges, the FY 2024 </span><span>Executive Budget advances a comprehensive funding plan to put the MTA on stable financial footing. It adds substantial new </span><span>operating and capital aid for health care and establishes a new commission to examine and recommend reforms to improve </span><span>quality and reduce costs. It also provides extraordinary funding to local governments that are providing services and assisting </span><span>with the resettlement process for asylum seekers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The proposed FY 2024 Executive Budget also funds the initiatives outlined in the Governor’s State of the State address. These </span><span>include expanding mental health inpatient, outpatient, and supportive services (FY 2024: $134 million; FY 2025: $276 million); </span><span>providing matching funds to increase the State University centers endowments (maximum of $500 million total); giving a </span><span>monthly discount on electric utility bills for moderate-income customers (FY 2024: $200 million; FY 2025: $50 million); and </span><span>indexing the minimum wage to inflation and funding the cost for State service providers (FY 2024: $19 million; FY 2025: $63 </span><span>million).</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>64</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan projects that State Operating Funds spending will total $125.2 billion in FY 2024, an increase of </span><span>$2.5 billion, or 2 percent, from the current fiscal year.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan projects out-year budget gaps of $5.1 billion in FY 2025, $8.6 billion in FY 2026, </span><span>and $7.2 billion in FY 2027, a total of roughly $21 billion over three years. The budget gaps that have opened in each year are </span><span>due principally to the downward revisions in projected tax receipts, which have been lowered by $20 billion (FY 2025 to FY </span><span>2027) in comparison to the Enacted Budget Financial Plan. If the FY 2025 Budget is balanced with recurring savings, the </span><span>projected budget gap for FY 2026 would be $3.5 billion. The projected budget gaps do not reflect the use of any reserves to </span><span>balance operations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic turning points create heightened risks to the Financial Plan. In the two recessions prior to COVID, tax receipts fell </span><span>more steeply and for a longer period than originally expected. While the DOB forecast is based on reasonable assumptions, </span><span>the impact of an economic slowdown is highly unpredictable. A second, new risk has been created by the PTET program, </span><span>which has introduced a high degree of uncertainty in the level and timing of expected PIT tax collections. Lastly, the State is </span><span>dependent on a range of Federal approvals to implement savings measures and receive reimbursement for costs it has </span><span>incurred in the first instance. The Updated Financial Plan maintains a reserve for such transaction risks, in addition to the </span><span>principal reserves and other reserves for specific purposes (e.g., future labor agreements).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The updated </span><span>“</span><span>base</span><span>”</span><span> forecast provides the basis for the development of the Governor’s FY 2024 Executive Budget proposal. </span><span>DOB has made several forecast (</span><span>“</span><span>base</span><span>”</span><span>) revisions to the Financial Plan estimates in the Mid-Year Update. The most </span><span>significant change has been to base tax receipts, which have been reduced in each year of the Financial Plan, starting in FY </span><span>2024. The downward revisions are consistent with DOB’s updated economic forecast, which calls for a mild recession in </span><span>calendar year 2023. Disbursements have been revised for updated operating results and program information. Other changes </span><span>include revisions to the Reserve for the Timing of PTET/PIT Credits and the addition of an $800 million reserve consistent </span><span>with the consensus revenue forecast agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Governor's Executive Budget Proposal</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Governor’s Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan for FY 2024 is balanced in the General Fund, and State Operating </span><span>Funds spending grows by 2 percent. The FY 2024 Executive Budget funds initiatives and investments for a range of essential </span><span>services including the health care system, MTA and local governments. It also funds the initiatives outlined in the Governor’s </span><span>State of the State address, including investments in mental health, housing, public safety, and additional funding for SUNY. In </span><span>addition, State operations funding is increased for essential services. Lastly, new capital commitments proposed in the </span><span>budget are funded not only with bonds but also with cash resources, to ensure that the State’s debt burden remains </span><span>affordable.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Receipts</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes the following tax law changes with significant Financial Plan impacts:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Franchise Tax Rates. The FY 2024 Executive Budget extends through Tax Year 2026 the tax rates on the </span><span>business income base for Article 9-A filers with business income tax bases over $5 million, as well as reinstates the </span><span>capital base tax rate for certain taxpayers.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Tobacco Tax Increase/Flavor Ban. To reduce tobacco use, especially among young people, the FY 2024 Executive Budget </span><span>proposes expanding the State's ban on the sale of flavored vaping products by prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco </span><span>products and increasing the cigarette tax from $4.35 to $5.35 per pack. These actions are expected to reduce cigarette </span><span>tax receipts that flow to both the General Fund and the Health Care Reform Act (HCRA).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other Tax Revenue Actions. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes various extensions, enforcement initiatives and </span><span>reforms including the proposed extension of credits for historic property rehabilitation, NYC musical arts, and farmers, as </span><span>well as a new credit for child care expansion.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Debt Service. Costs reflect the financing of new capital initiatives included in the FY 2024 Executive Budget. The Updated </span><span>Financial Plan also includes $900 million of additional debt service prepayments in FY 2023 that reduce debt service costs in </span><span>FY 2024.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Receipts/Transfers. The Updated Financial Plan also includes reductions to certain planned transfers due to the </span><span>availability of revenues in other funds that are earmarked to support new investments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>65</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disbursements</span></div> <div> <div><span>Local Assistance</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>School Aid. The Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan recommends $34.4 billion in State aid to schools for school year </span><span>(SY) 2024, an increase of $3.1 billion (10.0 percent). Including Federal prekindergarten expansion grants, schools will receive </span><span>$34.5 billion. This growth primarily reflects a $2.7 billion (12.8 percent) Foundation Aid increase, including a minimum 3 </span><span>percent annual increase to fully funded districts that would otherwise not receive a Foundation Aid increase under current </span><span>law. The growth in Foundation Aid largely reflects the full funding of the current formula for the first time in its 17-year </span><span>history, marking the final year of the three-year phase-in. Additionally, a High-Impact Tutoring Set-Aside of $250 million </span><span>within Foundation Aid directs support to students struggling to recover from pandemic-related learning loss. In addition to </span><span>the Foundation Aid increase, School Aid growth includes a $232 million increase in expense-based aids and a $125 million </span><span>increase in State-funded full-day prekindergarten programming for four-year-old children.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Medicaid Global Cap. Global Cap spending growth in FY 2024 is estimated at $1.4 billion. The Global Cap index has been </span><span>revised based on updated Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annual projections of health care spending. The </span><span>revised rates allow additional Medicaid spending growth above the Mid-Year Financial Plan forecast of $224 million in FY </span><span>2023 and $475 million in FY 2024, growing to $754 million in FY 2027.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Medicaid spending is currently projected to exceed the cap by $454 million in FY 2026 and $526 million in FY 2027. The </span><span>higher cost is mainly attributable to higher-than-expected enrollment, utilization and spending trends.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes several investments in health care, including increasing and/or adding Medicaid </span><span>reimbursement for hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living providers, primary care, school-based health centers, </span><span>transportation services, and additional types of mental health providers in community health centers. In addition, the </span><span>Updated Financial Plan includes savings beginning April 1, 2023 due to the transition of the prescription drug program for all </span><span>Medicaid members enrolled in Mainstream Managed Care to the State run Medicaid Pharmacy Program. With this transition, </span><span>New York State will pay pharmacies directly for drugs and supplies on behalf of Medicaid members. Transitioning the </span><span>pharmacy benefit from Managed Care to Medicaid Fee-for-Service will result in significant savings to the State, most of </span><span>which will be reinvested back into healthcare. Other proposals include expanding the Medicaid Buy-in program so more </span><span>disabled persons can continue to work without the risk of losing health benefits and supporting critical primary and </span><span>preventative care for Medicaid enrollees that will help improve population health and reduce preventable hospitalizations and </span><span>emergency room visits.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To maintain spending within the Global Cap, several proposals to reduce or offset costs are advanced in the FY 2024 </span><span>Executive Budget. Most notably, the State expects to utilize the entirety of Affordable Care Act (ACA) Enhanced Federal </span><span>Medical Assistance Percentage (eFMAP) savings to offset growth in Medicaid costs borne by the State rather than counties </span><span>($624 million). Other savings proposals include shifting pregnancy coverage to the Essential Plan (EP) ($53 million in FY 2024 </span><span>and $210 million annually thereafter); and aligning the timing of expanded coverage for certain groups with the Federal </span><span>waiver submission ($172 million).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>eFMAP Extension. The Federal FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill included an extension of eFMAP through the end of the </span><span>2023 calendar year. Beginning April 1, 2023, eFMAP will be reduced over the next three quarters: 5 percent through June 30, </span><span>2.5 percent through September 30, and 1.5 percent through December 31. The Financial Plan previously reflected eFMAP </span><span>through March 31, 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asylum Seekers Services and Assistance. The FY 2024 Executive Budget provides support to asylum seekers in New York City, </span><span>including shelter cost reimbursement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Minimum Wage Indexing. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes indexing New York’s minimum wage to inflation to benefit </span><span>hundreds of thousands of minimum wage workers across New York State and assist them to meet the rising cost of living, </span><span>which results in increased State assistance to mental hygiene, health care and social services providers supported by the </span><span>State.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mental Health. Proposed actions for the Office of Mental Health (OMH) include investments across the continuum of care for </span><span>mental health and continued support for community-based services, including residential programs. Specifically, this </span><span>includes establishing and operating 3,500 new residential units for people with mental illness, including 1,500 Supportive </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>66</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Housing beds, 900 transitional step-down beds, 600 licensed apartment treatment beds and 500 community residence-single</span><span> room occupancy (CR-SRO) beds. Outpatient mental health services throughout the State will be significantly </span><span>expanded by funding twelve new Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs; 42 new Assertive Community Treatment </span><span>teams; 26 new Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, including an Indigent Care Program to ensure providers are </span><span>reimbursed for care; eight new Safe Options Support teams; the expansion of the Critical Time Intervention (CTI) initiative </span><span>started in 2022; 42 new Health Home Plus Care Managers; and start-up funding and operating costs for expanded clinic </span><span>capacity at 20 sites. The FY 2024 Executive Budget also expands mental health services for children and families, enhances </span><span>suicide prevention programs, strengthens supportive housing programs, and supports the 2.5 percent Cost of Living </span><span>Adjustment (COLA) for voluntary operated providers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Public Health/Aging. The FY 2024 Executive Budget adds funding for respite care for high-need family caregivers and </span><span>expands access to home care aides for lower income older adults.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Services/Housing. The FY 2024 Executive Budget provides funding to ensure continuity in the level of childcare </span><span>subsidies, expands eligibility for child care subsidies to more families, and creates an Employer-Supported Child Care Pilot </span><span>Program to provide new financial support for child care. Other significant increases include investments in permanency </span><span>resource centers and kinship services, consolidating afterschool program funding in the Office of Children and Family </span><span>Services (OCFS), assisting foster care agencies with Federal provisions as they relate to Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD), </span><span>and establishing the Planning Assistance Fund to support local governments in achieving new home targets pursuant to the </span><span>New York Housing Compact. These investments are offset by making permanent the restructured financing approach for </span><span>residential school placements of children with special needs outside New York City and utilization of Mortgage Insurance </span><span>Fund (MIF) resources to fund housing and homelessness programs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Environment/Energy. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes funding to expand the Energy Affordability Program to </span><span>consumers who have not been previously eligible. The program will provide income-eligible customers with a discount on </span><span>their monthly electric and/or gas bills ($200 million in FY 2024 and $50 million thereafter).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Higher Education. The FY 2024 Executive Budget adds $40 million in recurring annual operating support for City University of </span><span>New York (CUNY) campuses starting in Academic Year 2024 and provides additional funding in FY 2024 to help cover student </span><span>tuition costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Public Safety. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes increased support for Prosecutors, Alternatives to Incarceration (ATI), </span><span>the Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) program, re-entry services, and pretrial services. The Budget also includes </span><span>funding to combat the flow of fentanyl, including the establishment of an Anti-Fentanyl Innovation Grant, as well as support </span><span>to hire additional crime and data analysts focused on fentanyl distribution and deaths.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transportation. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes one-time State assistance to the MTA to address extraordinary </span><span>revenue impacts caused by the pandemic ($300 million) and increases to upstate transit operating aid to match the year to </span><span>year increase in on-budget, traditional MTA aid. Other initiatives include $24 million annually for operating costs of the </span><span>Gateway Development Commission and $2 million to begin funding an Innovative Mobility Initiative for non-MTA systems.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All Other Local Assistance. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes increased funding for various other programs and </span><span>initiatives including recurring assistance to the City of Albany ($15 million), the Liberty Defense Project and the Office of New </span><span>Americans, and various programs administered by the Empire State Development Corporation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Agency Operations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Agency Operations. The growth in executive agency budgets reflects funding to meet critical service needs, as well as efforts </span><span>to assess lead risks and support lead abatement in housing across the State and modernize health reporting systems. In </span><span>addition, funding is included to support consulting costs associated with development of Section 1115 Medicaid </span><span>demonstration waivers that have allowed the State to implement a managed care program that provides comprehensive and </span><span>coordinated health care to Medicaid patients. Increased funding for agency operations also supports inpatient beds in State-operated</span><span> Psychiatric Centers, expanded State Police community stabilization units, enhanced parole supervisions programs, </span><span>investments in information technology including the Joint Security Operations Center, and geographical wage adjustments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>67</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asylum Seekers Services and Assistance. The Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA) has deployed national guard </span><span>servicemembers to various hotels, homeless shelters, and emergency sites throughout New York City to implement, </span><span>administer, and effectuate the provision of services.</span></div> <div> <div><span>State Police Recruiting Class. Increased funding will support two additional State Police recruiting classes in FY 2024, for a </span><span>total of four planned classes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SUNY Endowment Funding. The State will provide $1 in State funds (up to $500 million) for every $2 in private contributions </span><span>to endowments for SUNY’s four university centers: Buffalo, Binghamton, Albany, and Stony Brook. The endowment funds are </span><span>expected to be used to provide long-term support for campus operations, student scholarships, research, endowed </span><span>professorships, and the development of new academic fields.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Legislature/Judiciary. The FY 2024 Executive Budget reflects budget requests submitted by the Legislature and Judiciary. The </span><span>Judiciary requested increases in annual operating spending to fund expected hiring, three planned Court Officer Academy </span><span>classes, the addition of 34 new Judgeships, and collective bargaining increases expected to be implemented by March 2023. </span><span>Spending increases for the Legislature are mainly driven by personnel costs for legislative staff, as well as anticipated </span><span>increases for the recently approved increase in member salaries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Accelerate Deposits to the Retiree Health Benefit Trust Fund (RHBTF) . In FY 2022, the State made its first deposit to the </span><span>RHBTF, which was created in FY 2018 to reserve money for the payment of health benefits of retired employees and their </span><span>dependents. The reserves establish an asset against the State’s post-employment health insurance liability. The Updated </span><span>Financial Plan reflects making deposits that were planned in later years of the Financial Plan in FY 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fringe Benefits/Fixed Costs. The Judiciary Budget includes lower pension estimates offset by increased health insurance </span><span>costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FY 2024 Executive Budget also includes proposed legislation again this year that would align interest rates paid on court </span><span>judgements by public and private entities to the rate permitted for civil money judgments recovered in Federal district court. </span><span>Since the early 1980’s, the interest rate on judgments and accrued claims has been set at 9 percent. Payment of a prevailing </span><span>market rate is expected to help ensure that neither party in a lawsuit is disadvantaged by an interest rate that is above or </span><span>below what otherwise could be earned while cases are being adjudicated. This proposal will provide relief for local </span><span>governments and lower State taxpayer costs by millions of dollars.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transfer to Other Funds</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital Projects. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes investments to expand housing capacity, outpatient mental health </span><span>services, facilitate digital transformation across the SUNY system, invest in new and renovated research buildings, </span><span>laboratories, and state-of-the art instrumentation at SUNY Flagship institutions, improve capital facilities through the SUNY </span><span>and CUNY systems and various economic development projects. The FY 2024 Executive Budget also funds the DMV </span><span>transformation initiative and geographic pay increases for DOT maintenance staff.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SUNY Operations. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes $75 million in State aid to SUNY in Academic Year 2024 ($56 </span><span>million in FY 2024) for transformational initiatives at campuses that support innovation, help meet workforce needs, and </span><span>provide student support. This funding commitment will disburse over a two-year period. In addition, the Updated Financial </span><span>Plan provides $60 million ($45 million in FY 2024) in new recurring general operating support for SUNY campuses and </span><span>provides additional funding in FY 2024 to help cover student tuition costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reserve Changes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The previously planned deposits to principal reserves in FY 2024 ($2.4 billion) and FY 2025 ($2.9 billion) will be accelerated </span><span>and completed in the current year (FY 2023). In addition, the projected available surpluses in FY 2023 ($782 million) and FY </span><span>2024 ($851 million) will be carried forward and used to lower the projected outyear budget gaps.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Financial Plan Highlights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reserve Increases</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>68</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Principal Reserves</span><span>2</span><span> . The Updated Financial Plan reflects completing the remaining $10.6 billion of planned deposits and set </span><span>asides to principal reserves two years ahead of schedule. By the end of FY 2023, the balance in principal reserves is expected </span><span>to be just over $19.5 billion, an amount that maintains 15 percent of projected FY 2025 State Operating Funds disbursements </span><span>as proposed in the FY 2023 Executive Budget.</span> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>DOB defines principal reserves as the two </span><span>“</span><span>rainy day</span><span>”</span><span> reserves (consisting of the Tax Stabilization Reserve and the Rainy Day Reserve) and the </span><span>portion of the General Fund balance informally designated for economic uncertainties.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes legislation to increase the amount the State is permitted to set aside in statutory </span><span>reserves by increasing the maximum allowable balance for the Rainy Day Reserve from 15 percent to 20 percent, and the </span><span>maximum annual deposit from 3 percent to 10 percent, of State Operating Funds spending. In addition, the calculation </span><span>would be based on the spending projection included in the Enacted Budget Financial Plan. The allocation of principal reserves </span><span>may be adjusted in future updates consistent with the allowable balance and deposit authorization for the Rainy Day Reserve.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Debt Reduction Reserve Fund. To ensure the State can abide by the limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act, $1 billion will be </span><span>used to recapitalize the debt reduction reserve.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>RHBTF. The Updated Financial Plan reflects accelerating a $600 million deposit in FY 2023, from FY 2026 and FY 2027, </span><span>increasing the reserve to $1.2 billion by the end of FY 2023. The deposit is consistent with the statutory limit of 1.5 percent of </span><span>the actuarial accrued liability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cash Position</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>DOB expects that the General Fund will have sufficient liquidity in FY 2024 to make all planned payments as they become </span><span>due. DOB continues to reserve money on a quarterly basis for debt service payments that are financed with General Fund </span><span>resources. Money to pay debt service on bonds secured by dedicated receipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax bonds, </span><span>continues to be set aside as required by law and bond covenants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Debt Service</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Debt service spending consists of the payment of principal, interest, and related expenses on State-supported debt. </span><span>Prepayments executed in prior years, as well as planned prepayments in FY 2023, have a substantial impact on total debt </span><span>service spending. Excluding the impact of the prepayments, debt service expenses are projected to remain flat in FY 2024 </span><span>over the prior year. The table below provides a summary of the impact of actual and planned prepayments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund Financial Plan</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund receipts are affected by the deposit of dedicated taxes in other funds for debt service and other purposes, the </span><span>transfer of balances between funds of the State, and other factors. Three significant factors affect reported General Fund tax </span><span>receipts, as described below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>First, changes in debt service on State-supported revenue bonds affect General Fund tax receipts. The State utilizes bonding </span><span>programs where tax receipts are deposited into dedicated debt service funds (outside the General Fund) and used to make </span><span>debt service payments. After satisfying debt service requirements for these bonding programs, the balance is transferred to </span><span>the General Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Second, the STAR program is funded from PIT receipts, with changes in the State-supported cost of the program affecting </span><span>reported PIT receipts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Lastly, beginning in FY 2022, the PTET program began affecting reported General Fund tax collections. In FY 2022, the State </span><span>collected $16.4 billion in PTET payments through business tax receipts. In FY 2023, it expects to continue to collect PTET and </span><span>pay PIT credits connected with the program for tax years 2021 and 2022. The General Fund reserved the entire amount of </span><span>PTET collections received in FY 2022 and will use a portion of that balance to cover the difference between PTET collections </span><span>and related PIT refunds in FY 2023 and beyond. The timing between the initial PTET collections and subsequent refunds will </span><span>be managed in a similar manner in each year of the Financial Plan. The PTET program is expected to have no net impact on </span><span>operations over its life but will distort the annual change for business and PIT receipts.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>69</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund disbursements are affected by the level of financing sources available in other funds, transfers of balances </span><span>between funds of the State, and other factors that may change annually. For example, education and health care programs </span><span>are affected by the level of financing sources (i.e., HCRA and lottery/gaming receipts) available in other funds. Projected </span><span>spending also reflects DOB's cautious estimates of disbursements, a practice that provides a cushion for potential receipts </span><span>shortfalls and unanticipated costs.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Updated FY 2023 Financial Plan</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Receipts</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund receipts, including transfers but excluding PTET, are expected to total $106.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of </span><span>$9.9 billion (10.2 percent) over FY 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax receipts, excluding the impact of PTET, but including transfers after payment of debt service, are estimated to total $99.0 </span><span>billion in FY 2023, an increase of $13.7 billion (16.1 percent) from FY 2022. The increase reflects projected growth in tax </span><span>receipts and the impact of prepayments of future debt service costs. Excluding the prepayments, tax receipts are estimated to </span><span>increase by 9.8 percent from FY 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>PIT receipts, excluding PTET and debt prepayments, are estimated to total $70.1 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $6.3 billion </span><span>(9.9 percent) from FY 2022 reflecting underlying growth in collections. The actual and planned prepayments of debt service </span><span>due in future years reduce reported PIT receipts in the fiscal year in which the payments are made and increase PIT receipts </span><span>in the fiscal years in which the debt service was originally scheduled to be paid. Debt prepayments reduce General Fund PIT </span><span>receipts by $4.3 billion and $1.8 billion in FY 2022 and FY 2023, respectively and increase PIT receipts in FY 2024 by $3.2 </span><span>billion.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumption/use tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated </span><span>to total $17.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $569 million (3.4 percent) from FY 2022. This includes the impact of the </span><span>prepayment of debt service in FY 2022, which reduces receipts by $2.25 billion. Base sales tax growth is estimated at 10.6 </span><span>percent in FY 2023 and is offset by the drop in tax revenue attributable to the temporary suspension of the State sales tax on </span><span>gasoline and diesel motor fuel from June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and estimated declines in cigarette and tobacco tax </span><span>collections.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Business tax receipts, excluding PTET, are estimated at $10.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $1.8 billion (20.8 percent) from </span><span>FY 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in Corporate Franchise Tax (CFT) gross receipts and audit </span><span>receipts. FY 2023 includes the first prepayment affected by the temporary increase in the business income and capital base </span><span>rates enacted in FY 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on Clean Water/Clean Air (CW/CA) Bonds, are expected </span><span>to total $3.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $357 million from FY 2022. This is primarily due to the receipt of multiple </span><span>super-large estate tax payments of more than $100 million.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Miscellaneous receipts are projected to increase by $707 million from FY 2022 primarily driven by higher investment income </span><span>receipts. The State used $4.5 billion from ARP recovery aid in FY 2022 and plans to use another $2.4 billion from American </span><span>Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) recovery aid in FY 2023 to fund eligible expenditures, including essential governmental </span><span>services.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-tax transfers in FY 2023 includes a Transaction Risk Reserve that offsets total projected transfers from other funds and </span><span>provides a hedge against risks to receipts that may materialize later in the fiscal year or in FY 2024. The Transaction Risk </span><span>Reserve totals $1.8 billion in FY 2023, after adjustments made herein and the movement of $1 billion to the reserve for Debt </span><span>Management. Excluding the risk reserve, total non-tax transfers are estimated at $3.6 billion in FY 2023, a decrease of $623 </span><span>million from FY 2022 due to the transfer of a large Tribal State Compact Fund receipt in FY 2022. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disbursements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total $94.5 billion in FY 2023, an increase of </span><span>$5.6 billion (6.3 percent) from FY 2022. The growth in spending is attributable to initiatives and investments in nearly all </span><span>major programs, including health care, School Aid, mental hygiene, social services, one-time bonus payments to health </span><span>care/direct care workers, and recovery assistance to individuals and small businesses.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>70</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In FY 2023, </span><span>healthcare and direct care workers earning less than $125,000 will receive a State-funded bonus payment of up to $3,000 at </span><span>an estimated cost of $1.3 billion. School Aid and Medicaid, the largest local programs, are projected to increase spending by a </span><span>combined $4.0 billion in FY 2023. School Aid is estimated to increase by nearly $1 billion on a State fiscal year basis, primarily </span><span>driven by the continuing phase-in of the Foundation Aid formula. Medicaid spending is projected to grow by $3.1 billion, </span><span>reflecting the updated method for calculating allowable spending growth under the Global Cap, increased costs related to </span><span>minimum wage and funding of the local share of program growth.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Other areas with significant growth include the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) ($1.2 billion) driven by </span><span>rental assistance and homeless housing services; funding for backlogged Child Welfare Services claims ($796 million), mental </span><span>hygiene ($196 million) for expanded services, increased capacity, and a 5.4 percent human services COLA; special education </span><span>and other education programs ($255 million) driven by increased special education provider tuition rates and enrollment </span><span>growth for such programs, charter school supplemental tuition reimbursement and aid to nonpublic schools; utility arrears </span><span>assistance ($250 million); public health and aging ($200 million); public protection and safety ($73 million); and other </span><span>programs including child care, housing, and economic development.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Agency operations costs, including fringe benefits, are expected to total $21.9 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion </span><span>from FY 2022. The annual change is partly driven by several nonrecurring transactions processed in FY 2022, including the </span><span>funding of $2.2 billion of eligible payroll costs, including fringe benefits, from the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF), which </span><span>lowered FY 2022 spending. The lower spending in FY 2022 is partly offset by the ongoing purchase of COVID-19 test kits, </span><span>payment of retroactive salary increases, and the transfer of additional funds to RHBTF, including the acceleration of deposits </span><span>previously planned in FYs 2025 and 2026 to FY 2023 ($600 million). In addition, FY 2023 spending includes an offset of $800 </span><span>million for expected Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reimbursement that lowers spending. Excluding these </span><span>nonrecurring transactions, operational costs are projected to increase in FY 2023 due to rising energy and commodity prices </span><span>and negotiated general salary increases.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund transfers to Other Funds are projected to total $8.2 billion in FY 2023, a decrease of $1.6 billion from FY 2022. </span><span>Transfers for capital projects are expected to decline by $2.4 billion reflecting the timing of bond reimbursements and a $931 </span><span>million transfer to the MTA accelerated from FY 2023 to March 2022 and are partly offset by higher transfers for SUNY ($122 </span><span>million) and all other transfers ($656 million) mainly for health care, indigent legal services and transportation and transit </span><span>support. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>FY 2023 Closing Balance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excluding the PTET reserve for the timing of PTET/PIT credits and the reserve for extraordinary monetary settlements to fund </span><span>existing commitments and projects, DOB estimates the General Fund will end FY 2023 with a balance of $26.8 billion, an </span><span>increase of $12.0 billion over FY 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Principal reserves are expected to increase by $10.6 billion </span><span>—</span><span> $3.1 billion in statutory Rainy Day Reserves and $7.4 billion set </span><span>aside for economic uncertainties.

The decrease reflects the </span><span>effects of a mild recession on PIT revenues, in addition to declines in CFT receipts and estate tax receipts.

The decrease reflects reduced extension </span><span>payments for tax year 2022 driven by a strong decline in nonwage income, coupled with declines in final returns and </span><span>delinquencies, offset by a decrease in total refunds primarily attributable to the expiration of the 2022 homeowner tax rebate </span><span>credit.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Consumption/use tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated </span><span>to total $18.4 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $1.2 billion (6.8 percent) from FY 2023. This increase reflects moderate growth </span><span>in the sales tax base (2.9 percent), including the expiration of the temporary suspension of the State sales tax on gasoline </span><span>and diesel motor fuel on December 31, 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Business tax receipts, excluding PTET, are estimated at $8.8 billion in FY 2024, a decrease of $1.4 billion (14.0 percent) from </span><span>FY 2023. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in CFT gross receipts, reflecting a projected decline in corporate profits, </span><span>and a decrease in audit receipts to recent trend levels.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on CW/CA Bonds, are expected to total $2.4 billion in FY </span><span>2024, a decrease of $889 million from FY 2023. This is primarily due to a decline in the real estate transfer tax and the estate </span><span>tax returning to typical trends following record receipt collections in FY 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Miscellaneous receipts are projected to decline by over $600 million from FY 2023 due to high investment income receipts in </span><span>FY 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-tax transfers are estimated to total $1.9 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $99 million from FY 2023. The modest change </span><span>is mainly attributable to increases in transfers from the Health Care Transformation and Mental Health Services funds and is </span><span>almost fully offset by an increase in the Transaction Risk Reserve compared to FY 2023. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disbursements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total $106.9 billion in FY 2024, an increase of </span><span>$12.4 billion (13.2 percent) from FY 2023. The annual change in spending is affected by the expected expiration of the eFMAP </span><span>at the end of the third quarter of FY 2024. The higher Federal matching rate has temporarily lowered State-share spending </span><span>and increased the Federal share of Medicaid costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local assistance spending is estimated to total $73.3 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $8.8 billion from FY 2023. General Fund </span><span>spending for education and health care represents most of the local assistance spending. General Fund support for these </span><span>programs is affected by the level of financing sources (i.e., HCRA and lottery/gaming receipts) available in other funds, as </span><span>well as the impact of eFMAP. School Aid is estimated to increase by $3.2 billion (12.6 percent) on a State fiscal year basis, </span><span>primarily reflecting the final year of the phase-in of full funding of the current Foundation Aid formula, a $125 million </span><span>investment in State-funded full day prekindergarten programming for four- year old children and assumed growth in </span><span>expense-based aids.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Medicaid spending is projected to grow by $2.3 billion due to investments in health care, offset by savings resulting from the </span><span>transition of the pharmacy benefit from Managed Care to Medicaid Fee- for-Service, the phase down of the eFMAP extension </span><span>through December 31, 2023, and actions to maintain spending within the Global Cap. Additional local assistance growth is </span><span>primarily a result of additional assistance to the MTA to address operating shortfalls, initiatives and investments to improve </span><span>mental health care services, access to affordable housing, additional support for public safety initiatives, wage increases, and </span><span>one-time funding to support asylum seekers services and assistance in New York City. Partially offsetting these increases are </span><span>one-time funding for Child welfare services and pandemic recovery initiatives. Lastly, General Fund local assistance has been </span><span>reduced in the current year based on operating results to date and other information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Fund agency operations costs, including fringe benefits, are expected to total $23.3 billion in FY 2024, an increase of </span><span>$1.5 billion from FY 2023. The growth in executive agency budgets reflects efforts to assess lead risks and support lead </span><span>abatement for housing across the State, modernize health reporting systems, conduct additional State Police recruiting </span><span>classes, provide State matching funds for contributions to the endowments for SUNY’s four university centers, and increase </span><span>inpatient beds in State-operated Psychiatric Centers.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>demonstration waivers increase spending in FY 2024. Fringe benefit costs are expected to increase in FY 2024 primarily due </span><span>to the increased costs of providing health insurance and pension benefits to current and retired employees.</span></div> <div> <div><span>General Fund transfers to Other Funds are projected to total $10.4 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion from FY 2023, </span><span>mainly attributable to transfers for capital projects reflecting an increase in planned PAYGO capital spending and increased </span><span>transfers to SUNY for transformational initiatives at campuses that support innovation, help meet workforce needs, and </span><span>provide student support. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>FY 2024 Closing Balance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excluding the PTET reserve for the timing of PTET/PIT credits and the reserve for extraordinary monetary settlements to fund </span><span>existing commitments and projects, DOB projects the State will end FY 2024 with a General Fund cash balance of $26.7 </span><span>billion, a decrease of $95 million from FY 2023. The reserves for debt management and labor settlements are projected to </span><span>increase by just over $1 billion. The balance available for all other purposes is expected to decline due to the use of prior year </span><span>resources to fund certain commitments and operations in FY 2024, partially offset by the addition of an $800 million reserve </span><span>consistent with the consensus revenue agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cash Flow</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Finance Law authorizes the General Fund to borrow money temporarily from available funds held in the Short-Term </span><span>Investment Pool (STIP). Loans to the General Fund are limited to a term not to exceed four months or the end of the fiscal </span><span>year, whichever is shorter. The resources that can be borrowed by the General Fund are limited to available balances in STIP, </span><span>as determined by the State Comptroller. Available balances include money in the State’s governmental funds and a relatively </span><span>small amount of other money belonging to the State, held in internal service and enterprise funds, as well as certain agency </span><span>funds. Several accounts in Debt Service Funds and Capital Projects Funds that are part of All Governmental Funds are </span><span>excluded from the balances deemed available in STIP. These excluded funds consist of bond proceeds and money obligated </span><span>for debt service payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FY 2024 Executive Budget continues to authorize short-term financing for liquidity purposes during the fiscal year. In </span><span>doing so, it provides a tool to help the State manage cashflow, if needed, and more effectively deploy resources as the State </span><span>continues to respond to the pandemic. Specifically, the authorization allows for the issuance of up to $3 billion of PIT revenue </span><span>anticipation notes which mature no later than March 31, 2024. It also allows up to $2 billion in line of credit facilities, to be </span><span>drawn through March 31, 2024, subject to available appropriation. Neither authorization allows borrowed amounts to be </span><span>extended or refinanced beyond their initial maturity. The Updated Financial Plan does not assume the use of short-term </span><span>financing for liquidity purposes during FY 2024. DOB evaluates cash results regularly and may adjust the use of notes and/or </span><span>the line of credit based on liquidity needs, market considerations, and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State continues to reserve money on a quarterly basis for debt service payments financed with General Fund resources. </span><span>Money to pay debt service on bonds secured by dedicated receipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax Revenue bonds, </span><span>continues to be set aside as required by law and bond covenants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>PTET Financial Plan Impact</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have determined that State and local </span><span>income taxes imposed on and paid by a partnership or an S corporation on its income, such as the PTET, are allowable as a </span><span>Federal deduction to taxable income. In November 2020, the IRS released Notice 2020-75, which announced that the </span><span>Treasury and IRS intend to issue clarifying regulations with respect to such pass-through taxes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of the State’s continuing response to Federal tax law changes, legislation was enacted in FY 2022 to allow an optional </span><span>PTET on the New York-sourced income of partnerships and S corporations.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>are not necessarily realized by taxpayers within the same fiscal year that PTET revenue is received by the State, the PTET will </span><span>not be revenue-neutral to the State within each fiscal year. The Updated Financial Plan includes an estimate for PTET within </span><span>business taxes and the corresponding decrease in PIT receipts. Additionally, it has reserved PTET collected in FY 2022 for </span><span>purposes of offsetting the decrease in PIT receipts expected in FY 2023 and beyond. It is expected that the tax benefit </span><span>accompanying the PTET program will end in 2025 due to the scheduled expiration of the State and Local Tax (SALT) cap </span><span>under current Federal law. Therefore, the estimates in the Updated Financial Plan reflect the likelihood that entities cease to </span><span>participate in the later years of the Financial Plan period.</span></div> <div> <div><span>PTET is expected to reduce FY 2023 PIT collections by $18.8 billion and reduce all funds receipts by a net amount of $5.9 </span><span>billion, due to timing. PIT credits may be claimed on the April tax return in the following fiscal year, or they can be reflected </span><span>sooner through reductions in current estimated payments. In 2021, taxpayers could not reduce their current estimated PIT </span><span>payments for PTET, because enrollment in the PTET was not completed until late 2021 and affected taxpayers were not </span><span>statutorily authorized to do so. Going forward, some taxpayers are expected to choose this option. FY 2023 PIT collections </span><span>are expected to be reduced by credits for both the full amount of tax year 2021 PTET collections (through extensions and </span><span>refunds) and a portion of tax year 2022 PTET collections (through reductions in current estimated PIT payments).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The net impact of PTET declines in FY 2024 but is expected to reduce FY 2024 PIT collections by $13.8 billion and reduce all </span><span>funds receipts by a net amount of $2.3 billion.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>FY 2023 State Operating Funds Spending</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Operating Funds encompass the General Fund and a wide range of State activities funded from revenue sources </span><span>outside the General Fund, including dedicated tax revenues, tuition, income, fees, and assessments. Activities funded with </span><span>these dedicated revenue sources often have no direct bearing on the State’s ability to maintain a balanced budget in the </span><span>General Fund but are captured in State Operating Funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local Assistance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Approximately two-thirds of State spending is for local assistance that includes payments to local governments, school </span><span>districts, health care providers, managed care organizations, and other entities, as well as financial assistance to, or on behalf </span><span>of, individuals, families, and not-for-profit organizations. School Aid and Medicaid account for more than half of local </span><span>assistance spending. Over the past two years, local assistance funding includes spending for pandemic recovery initiatives, </span><span>which support time-limited programs including the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), Landlord Rental </span><span>Assistance Program, assistance to excluded workers, small business assistance, funding for hospitals that are experiencing </span><span>financial distress from the COVID- 19 pandemic, public utility arrears assistance, Healthcare/Direct Care Worker Bonuses, </span><span>and other targeted initiatives. Most of the one-time assistance is expected to be exhausted in FY 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>School Aid spending for School Year (SY) 2024 is estimated at $34.4 billion, excluding Federal prekindergarten grants, </span><span>representing an annual increase of $3.1 billion (10.0 percent). This annual growth is primarily driven by increased funding for </span><span>Foundation Aid ($2.7 billion), expense-based reimbursement programs ($232 million), and the expansion of State-funded </span><span>full-day prekindergarten programming for four-year-old children ($125 million). The growth in Foundation Aid reflects the </span><span>full funding of the current formula for the first time in its history, marking the final year of the three-year phase-in, and a </span><span>minimum 3 percent annual increase to fully funded districts that would otherwise not receive a Foundation Aid increase </span><span>under current law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Department of Health (DOH) Medicaid local assistance spending, excluding eFMAP, is estimated at $27.3 billion in FY 2024, </span><span>an annual increase of 7.4 percent. Medicaid costs reported under the Global Cap are projected to increase by $475 million, </span><span>consistent with the updated growth index. The increased funding will support growth in enrollment and medical cost </span><span>inflation, increased rates to nursing homes, increased homecare wages, expanded access to health coverage, and higher </span><span>provider reimbursements. The remaining growth is attributable to costs reported outside the Global Cap and is mainly driven </span><span>by minimum wage for health care providers ($188 million) and financial relief to counties and New York City associated with </span><span>full coverage of the local share of spending growth ($183 million). A portion of Medicaid-related expenses of Office for </span><span>People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) will be funded outside of the DOH Global Cap with additional Financial Plan </span><span>resources to accommodate DOH Medicaid spending growth.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Medicaid spending is also affected by the Federal government’s increased share of Medicaid funding through eFMAP. </span><span>Beginning January 1, 2020, the Federal government increased its share by 6.2 percent, which will be phased out by the end of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>74</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the 2023 calendar year. Beginning April 1, 2023, eFMAP will be reduced for each of the three quarters to 5 percent through </span><span>June 30, 2.5 percent through September 30, and 1.5 percent through December 31. The estimated State benefit of the </span><span>eFMAP in FY 2023 and FY 2024 is $3.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. State share savings from eFMAP have and </span><span>continue to be used to offset increased costs associated with persistently elevated COVID related enrollment, asylum seekers </span><span>services and assistance, and lost Medicaid Redesign Team II (MRT II) savings due to Federal restrictions regarding program </span><span>restructuring while the eFMAP remained in place. These costs and most of the eFMAP are outside of the Global Cap and are </span><span>funded through the Mental Hygiene Stabilization Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Mental Hygiene spending growth provides increased support for targeted investments in services to ensure individuals with </span><span>developmental disabilities, mental illness, substance use disorders and problem gambling have appropriate access to care. </span><span>The increases include continued support for prior year initiatives, such as implementation of the nationwide 988 Suicide and </span><span>Crisis Lifeline, OPWDD housing subsidy enhancements, and Office of Mental Health (OMH) residential investments. </span><span>Additional funding is included for a 2.5 percent human services COLA, new costs associated with indexing the minimum </span><span>wage to inflation, establishing and operating 3,500 new OMH residential units, increased support for youth suicide </span><span>prevention programs and other evidence-based programs serving children, and enhanced mental health services in schools.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Spending for transportation is projected to increase significantly due to one-time funding to the MTA to address </span><span>extraordinary financial impacts resulting from the pandemic ($300 million), increases to upstate transit operating aid and </span><span>forecasted increases in dedicated receipts that are collected by the State and remitted to the various transit systems. </span><span>Including one-time aid, total year to year increases are expected to provide an additional $560 million to the MTA, $40 </span><span>million for non-MTA downstate transit systems, and $18 million for upstate transit systems. The remaining increases reflect a </span><span>new Innovative Mobility Initiative for non-MTA transit systems and funding for the State share of operating costs for the </span><span>Gateway Development Commission.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Services increases include funding for services and assistance to New York City for asylum seekers in FY 2024 and </span><span>increases in child care assistance due to an expanded subsidy eligibility, increased reimbursement for child care providers and </span><span>their workforce, and the creation of an Employer-Supported Child Care Pilot Program. Other Social Services actions include </span><span>investments in permanency resource centers and kinship services, the consolidation of the Empire State and Advantage </span><span>Afterschool programs under OCFS, assistance for foster care agencies transitioning under Federal requirements, and the </span><span>indexing of the minimum wage. There is also increased funding for Code Blue, New York’s emergency weather safety plan, </span><span>and increases in the Empire State Supportive Housing Initiative (ESSHI). Payments for the child welfare program will continue </span><span>to support local districts' services and the year-to-year decline in such spending is attributable to the timing of such </span><span>payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Higher education spending is projected to grow by 4.9 percent in FY 2024, primarily reflecting estimated increases in </span><span>spending for student financial aid programs, including the continued expansion of TAP for part-time students, and increased </span><span>operating support for CUNY senior colleges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Increased funding for other education programs largely reflects the continuation of increased State support for special </span><span>education programs related to approval of an 11 percent COLA for provider tuition rates for SY 2023 and enrollment growth </span><span>for such programs, as well as increased costs to reimburse school districts for charter school supplemental tuition and </span><span>increased payments to New York City for charter school facilities aid. These increases are partially offset by the </span><span>discontinuation of one-time additions to the FY 2023 Enacted Budget.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other local assistance spending growth includes additional funding for energy affordability; criminal justice programs </span><span>including Aid to Prosecution, Alternatives to Incarceration (ATI) and Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) programs; </span><span>pretrial services; and Fentanyl abuse prevention. This increased spending is more than offset by time-limited pandemic </span><span>recovery initiatives including small business assistance, public utility arrears assistance, and one time funding for the Office of </span><span>Cannabis Management Social Equity Fund and world university games.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Operations/General State Charges (GSCs)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operating costs for State agencies include salaries, wages, fringe benefits, and Non-Personal Service (NPS) costs (e.g., </span><span>supplies, utilities) and comprise about a quarter of State Operating Funds spending.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational spending for executive agencies is affected by the timing of Federal reimbursement for State incurred pandemic </span><span>response and recovery efforts; and the payment of salary increases pursuant to existing contracts, including retroactive salary </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>75</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>increases. FY 2024 spending includes increased spending to support asylum seekers services and assistance efforts, four </span><span>State Police recruiting classes, lead abatement, and the opening of new inpatient beds in State-operated Psychiatric Centers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>University systems spending growth in FY 2024 reflects expected State payments related to the establishment of a $500 </span><span>million SUNY Endowment Fund to match new philanthropic contributions to the endowments of SUNY’s university centers. </span><span>Among other purposes, the earnings on these funds will provide long-term support for campus operations, student </span><span>scholarships, endowed professorships, innovative research, and the development of new academic fields. It also includes a </span><span>one-time investment of $75 million for transformational initiatives at SUNY campuses that support innovation, help meet the </span><span>workforce needs of the future, and provide needed supports to students. In addition, the Updated Financial Plan includes $60 </span><span>million in new recurring operating aid support for SUNY State-operated campuses and $21 million in additional funding to </span><span>help cover student tuition costs in response to proposed tuition changes at SUNY campuses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The operating costs for the offices of independently elected officials (Attorney General, Comptroller, Judiciary, and </span><span>Legislature) are projected to increase by a combined $100 million (3.6 percent). The increase is primarily due to planned </span><span>increases for personnel and contract costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Growth in GSCs spending is primarily attributable to cost increases for health insurance, driven by medical cost inflation and </span><span>projected utilization growth following delayed medical visits and procedures during the pandemic, and pension benefits for </span><span>current and retired employees. This annual growth is entirely offset by the advance payment to the State’s Retiree Health </span><span>Insurance Trust Fund of $600 million in FY 2023. The State’s annual pension payment is projected to grow by $200 million.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Matters Affecting the Financial Plan</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan is subject to economic, social, financial, political, public health, and environmental risks and </span><span>uncertainties, many of which are outside the ability of the State to predict or control. The projections of receipts and </span><span>disbursements in the Updated Financial Plan are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they were prepared, but DOB </span><span>is unable to provide any assurance that actual results will not differ materially and adversely from these projections.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan is based on numerous assumptions including the condition of the State and national economies, </span><span>and the collection of economically sensitive tax receipts in the amounts projected. Uncertainties and risks that may affect </span><span>economic and receipts forecasts include, but are not limited to, national and international events; inflation; consumer </span><span>confidence; commodity prices; supply chain disruptions; major terrorist events; hostilities or war; climate change and </span><span>extreme weather events; severe epidemic or pandemic events; cybersecurity threats; Federal funding laws and regulations; </span><span>financial sector compensation; monetary policy affecting interest rates and the financial markets; credit rating agency </span><span>actions; financial and real estate market developments which may adversely affect bonus income and capital gains </span><span>realizations; technology industry developments and employment; effect of household debt on consumer spending and State </span><span>tax collections; and outcomes of litigation and other claims affecting the State.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Litigation against the State may include, among other things, potential challenges to the constitutionality of various actions. </span><span>The State may also be affected by adverse decisions that are he result of various lawsuits. Such adverse decisions may not </span><span>meet the materiality threshold to warrant a description herein but, in the aggregate, could still adversely affect the Updated </span><span>Financial Plan</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan is subject to various uncertainties and contingencies including, but not limited to, wage and </span><span>benefit increases for State employees that exceed projected annual costs; changes in the size of the State’s workforce; </span><span>realization of the projected rate of return for pension fund asset assumptions with respect to wages for State employees </span><span>affecting the State's required pension fund contributions; the willingness and ability of the Federal government to provide the </span><span>aid projected in the Updated Financial Plan, including the Federal matching grant for the healthcare/direct care worker bonus </span><span>program; the ability of the State to implement cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in State agency operations, and </span><span>the success with which the State controls expenditures; unanticipated growth in Medicaid program costs; and the ability of </span><span>the State and its public authorities to issue securities successfully in public credit markets. Some of these issues are described </span><span>in more detail herein. The projections and assumptions contained in the Updated Financial Plan are subject to revisions </span><span>which may result in substantial changes. No assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which depend in </span><span>part upon actions the State expects to be taken but which are not within the State's control, will be realized.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>DOB routinely executes cash management actions to manage the State’s large and complex budget.

In recent years, the State has prepaid certain payments, subject to available resources, to maintain </span><span>budget flexibility.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Climate Change</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate change poses significant long-term threats to physical, biological, and economic systems in New York and around </span><span>the world. Potential hazards and risks related to climate change for the State include, among other things, rising sea levels, </span><span>increased coastal flooding and related erosion hazards, intensifying storms, and more extreme heat. The potential effects of </span><span>climate change could adversely impact the Updated Financial Plan in current or future years. To mitigate and manage these </span><span>impacts, significant long-term planning and investments by the Federal government, the State, municipalities, and public </span><span>utilities are expected to be needed to adapt existing infrastructure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In August 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations (IPCC) reported that 1.5°C of warming </span><span>is likely to occur by 2040 under all emissions scenarios considered and that the 1.5°C benchmark will be exceeded by 2100 </span><span>unless deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades. Human-induced climate change is </span><span>already affecting many weather extremes in every region across the globe. Further warming is expected to increase the risk </span><span>of adverse outcomes, including extreme weather events and coastal flooding.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Storms affecting the State, including Hurricane Ida (September 2021), Superstorm Sandy (October 2012), Tropical Storm Lee </span><span>(September 2011), and Hurricane Irene (August 2011), have demonstrated vulnerabilities in the State’s infrastructure </span><span>(including mass transit systems, power transmission and distribution systems, and other critical lifelines) to extreme weather </span><span>driven events, including coastal flooding caused by storm surges and flash floods from rainfall.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State continues to recover from damage sustained during these powerful storms. Hurricane Irene disrupted power and </span><span>caused extensive flooding in various counties. Tropical Storm Lee caused flooding in additional counties, and, in some cases, </span><span>exacerbated damage caused by Hurricane Irene two weeks earlier. Superstorm Sandy struck the East Coast, causing </span><span>widespread infrastructure damage and economic losses to the greater New York region. Hurricane Ida caused severe flooding </span><span>in the New York metropolitan area. The frequency and intensity of these storms present economic and financial risks to the </span><span>State. Reimbursement claims for costs of the immediate response, recovery, and future mitigation efforts continue, largely </span><span>supported by Federal funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Rating agencies are incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into their credit analysis for the State </span><span>and other issuers. Rising sea levels and their effect on coastal infrastructure have been identified as the primary climate risks </span><span>for the northeastern United States, including New York State. These risks are heightened by population and critical </span><span>infrastructure concentration in coastal counties. In June 2021, Moody’s first assigned New York State an environmental issuer </span><span>profile score of E-3 (moderately negative), below the nationwide median score of E-2 (neutral to low). The E-3 score reflected </span><span>Moody’s assessment that the State faces moderately negative exposure to physical climate risks, especially hurricanes and </span><span>sea level rise, which could cause significant economic disruption and pose risks to the State’s economy and tax base. In </span><span>March 2022, S&amp;P assigned New York State an environmental issuer profile score of E-3 (moderately negative) due to the risk </span><span>of coastal flooding in New York City and Long Island, which S&amp;P equates to risk exposure affecting about 40 percent of the </span><span>State’s population and roughly half of its jobs. The S&amp;P report cited the risk that a climate-related natural disaster could </span><span>disrupt the State’s economy and budgetary balance. The release of issuer ESG scores by the rating agencies does not cause a </span><span>change in the State’s overall credit ratings, which are based on financial information in addition to the ESG component. </span><span>Climate change risks increasingly fall within the maximum maturity term of current outstanding bonds of the State, its public </span><span>authorities, and municipalities. State bonds may generally be issued with a term of up to 30 years under State statute.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State is participating in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the risk of severe impacts from climate </span><span>change. In 2019, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) was signed into law. The CLCPA set the </span><span>State on a path toward developing regulations to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below the 1990 </span><span>level by 2030, and 85 percent below the 1990 level by 2050. Additionally, in accordance with the CLCPA, the State plans to </span><span>generate a minimum of 70 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and to fully transition its electricity sector </span><span>away from carbon emissions by 2040. There can be no assurances that such goals will ultimately be achieved.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The CLCPA created the Climate Action Council (CAC), which was tasked with developing a Scoping Plan with </span><span>recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase renewable energy usage, and promote climate justice. The </span><span>CAC approved and adopted the final Scoping Plan on December 19, 2022. Pursuant to the CLCPA, by January 1, 2024 the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>77</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Department of Environmental Conservation is required to draft and circulate enforceable rules and regulations that are </span><span>consistent with meeting the CLCPA's statewide greenhouse gas emission limits.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Concurrently, the State has been taking regulatory and legislative actions that are intended to limit greenhouse gas </span><span>emissions, electrify transportation, and generate more electricity from renewable sources. There can be no assurances that </span><span>such actions, or their intended outcomes, will be realized as planned. Major regulatory and legislative actions include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Requiring new off-road vehicles and equipment sold in New York to be zero-emissions by 2035 and new medium-duty </span><span>and heavy-duty vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2045;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Requiring the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to formulate the creation of a zero-emissions </span><span>vehicle development strategy in 2023;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Mandating that by no later than July 1, 2027, school districts and private transportation contractors purchase or lease </span><span>only zero-emission school buses when purchasing or leasing new school buses, with full fleet conversion and operation </span><span>of zero-emission school buses required by July 1, 2035;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Enacting the </span><span>“</span><span>Advanced Building Codes, Appliance and Equipment Efficiency Standards Act of 2022</span><span>”</span><span> to align the State's </span><span>energy code with its climate policies and strengthen efficiency standards for appliances;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Appropriating $500 million to advance the offshore wind industry; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Amending the Clean Energy Standard to reflect CLCPA targets.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, New York State has been a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which utilizes a cap-and-trade </span><span>mechanism to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants operating within each participating state since </span><span>2008.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>During the November 2022 general election, New York State voters approved the Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond </span><span>Act. The $4.2 billion bond act will support capital improvements and enhancements in the following areas: flood risk </span><span>reduction/restorations; open space, working lands conservation, and recreation; climate change mitigation; and water quality </span><span>improvement and resilient infrastructure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>COVID-19 Pandemic</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Important State revenue sources, including personal income, consumption, and business tax collections, may be adversely </span><span>affected by the long-term impact of COVID-19 on a range of activities and behaviors, including commuting patterns, remote </span><span>working and education, business activity, social gatherings, tourism, public transportation, and aviation. It is not possible to </span><span>assess or forecast the effects of such changes at this time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the behavior of resident and nonresident taxpayers. Consistent </span><span>with the growth in remote work arrangements, many residents and non-residents are no longer commuting into New York </span><span>City and instead are working remotely from home offices. However, under long-standing State policy, a non-resident working </span><span>from home pays New York income taxes on wages from a New York employer unless that employer has established the non-resident’s</span><span> home office as a bona fide office of the employer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The COVID-19 pandemic also led some New York residents to shelter in locations outside of the State. In addition, some </span><span>taxpayers who previously resided in New York have permanently relocated outside of the State during the pandemic. The </span><span>State continues to monitor the data to understand whether these trends are transitory.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There can be no assurance that existing and future COVID-19 variants will not adversely impact the State’s financial </span><span>condition. State officials continue to closely monitor global COVID-19 impacts and emerging Federal guidance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Federal Policy and Funding</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Federal government influences the economy and budget of New York State through grants, direct spending on its own </span><span>programs such as Medicare and Social Security, and through Federal tax policy. Federal policymakers may place conditions </span><span>on grants, mandate certain state actions, preempt state laws, change SALT bases and taxpayer behavior through tax policies, </span><span>and influence industries through regulatory action. Federal resources support vital services such as health care, education, </span><span>and transportation, as well as severe weather and emergency response and recovery. Any changes to Federal policy or </span><span>funding levels could have a materially adverse impact on the Updated Financial Plan.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>78</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Federal funding is a significant component of New York’s budget representing more than one-third of All Funds spending. </span><span>Routine Federal aid supports programs for vulnerable populations and those living at or near the poverty level. Such </span><span>programs include Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Elementary and Secondary Education Act </span><span>(ESEA) Title I grants, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants. Other Federal resources are directed at </span><span>infrastructure and public protection.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In response to the COVID-19 PHE, the Federal government has taken legislative, administrative, and Federal Reserve actions </span><span>intended to stabilize financial markets, extend aid to large and small businesses, health care providers, and individuals, and </span><span>reimburse governments for the direct costs of pandemic response. The Federal government enacted several laws between </span><span>March 2020 and March 2021 to provide financial assistance to state and local governments, schools, hospitals, transit </span><span>systems, businesses, families and individuals for COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery. The State also received </span><span>additional Federal aid in the form of enhanced Unemployment Insurance funding, which is reported under Proprietary and </span><span>Fiduciary Funds and is excluded from All Governmental Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Total Federal Funds spending for all purposes, inclusive of both capital and operating spending, is expected to total $83.9 </span><span>billion in FY 2024 and includes $11 billion in spending identified as pandemic assistance. The reporting of certain program </span><span>spending related to the pandemic is included in the agency disbursements, the largest of which include Disproportionate </span><span>Share Hospital (DSH), CHP, eFMAP, IDEA, and the TANF Pandemic Emergency Fund. Federal Funds spending estimated in FY </span><span>2024 continues to include significant pandemic assistance funds for education, eFMAP related to the extension of the COVID </span><span>eFMAP phase down, and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) eFMAP, as well as Federal reimbursement of </span><span>pandemic related spending incurred in prior fiscal years. Federal Funds spending programs are summarized below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Medicaid/Health. Funding shared by the Federal government helps support health care costs for over nine million New </span><span>Yorkers, including more than two million children. Medicaid is the single largest category of Federal funding. The Federal </span><span>government also provides support for several health programs administered by DOH, including the EP, which provides </span><span>health care coverage for low-income individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid or CHP.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Social Services. Federal funding helps with several programs managed by OTDA, including TANF-funded public </span><span>assistance benefits and the Flexible Fund for Family Services, Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), Supplemental </span><span>Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Child Support. Funding from the Federal government also supports programs </span><span>managed by OCFS, including Child Care, Child Welfare Services, Adult Protective &amp; Domestic Violence Services, Foster </span><span>Care, and Adoption Subsidies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Education. Federal funding supports K-12 education, special education and Higher Education. Like Medicaid and the </span><span>social services programs, significant portions of Federal education funding are directed toward vulnerable New Yorkers, </span><span>such as students in schools with high poverty levels, students with disabilities, and higher education students who </span><span>qualify for programs such as Pell grants and Work-Study.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Public Protection. Federal funding supports various programs and operations of the State Police, the Department of </span><span>Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), the Office of Victim Services, the Division of Homeland Security and </span><span>Emergency Services (DHSES), and DMNA. Federal funds are also passed on to municipalities to support a variety of </span><span>public safety programs.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Transportation. Federal resources support infrastructure investments in highway and transit systems throughout the </span><span>State, including funding participation in ongoing transportation capital plans. The recently enacted Infrastructure </span><span>Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58) increases the amount of Federal resources available to the State to fund capital </span><span>costs associated with transportation projects.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>All Other. Other programs supported by Federal resources include housing, economic development, mental hygiene, </span><span>parks and environmental conservation, and general government uses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pandemic Assistance</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Child Care Funds. The CARES, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA), and ARP Acts </span><span>granted additional funding to aid in stabilizing the childcare sector.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Education ARP Funds. The ARP granted additional education funding for Elementary and Secondary School Emergency </span><span>Relief (ESSER) and Emergency Assistance for Nonpublic Schools (EANS) programs, as well as funding for homeless </span><span>education, IDEA, library services and the arts.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)/COVID eFMAP. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal </span><span>government increased its share of Medicaid funding (eFMAP) by 6.2 percent for each calendar quarter occurring during </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>79</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the PHE. The enhanced funding began on January 1, 2020, and pursuant to the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act </span><span>signed into law on December 29, 2022, will be phased out by the end of December 2023: eFMAP will be reduced to 5 </span><span>percent from April 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023, to 2.5 percent from July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, and to </span><span>1.5 percent from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan projects a </span><span>benefit to the State of $3.7 billion in FY 2023 and $1.5 billion in FY 2024 through this enhanced Federal funding.</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>ARP HCBS eFMAP. The ARP also provided a temporary 10 percentage point increase to the FMAP for certain Medicaid </span><span>HCBS through March 31, 2022. In accordance with Maintenance of Effort requirements on ARP HCBS eFMAP eligibility, </span><span>the State has delayed the implementation of certain MRT II savings actions so that the State can receive an estimated </span><span>$2.4 billion in eFMAP for HCBS expenditures across health and mental hygiene programs ($975 million in FY 2023 and </span><span>$1.5 billion in FY 2024). CMS guidelines require the use of additional funding to supplement existing State funding, not </span><span>supplant existing resources, and the State has until March 31, 2024 to expend its earned eFMAP in accordance with the </span><span>submitted spending plan.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State, as required by CMS, submitted an initial spending plan and narrative detailing the use of the temporary </span><span>eFMAP on July 8, 2021. Following, the initial submission, CMS requires states to submit quarterly spending plan updates </span><span>and semi-annual spending plan narratives. Accordingly, the State submitted spending plans on October 18, 2021, </span><span>February 15, 2022, May 6, 2022, July 28, 2022, October 31, 2022, and February 7, 2023. Updates to the spending plan will </span><span>continue to be submitted in accordance with the reporting requirements. To date, CMS provided a partial spending plan </span><span>approval of 40 out of 42 proposals, and the State will continue working with CMS to receive full approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Education Supplemental Appropriations Act. As part of CRRSA, additional funding for education was provided through </span><span>the ESSER Fund and the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund, including dedicated GEER funds to </span><span>support pandemic-related services and assistance to nonpublic schools through the EANS program.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>ERAP. The CRRSA Act established the ERAP to assist households that are unable to pay rent and utilities due to the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP provided additional funding for the program.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Education CARES Act Funds. Additional education support provided through the CARES Act included funding to school </span><span>districts and charter schools.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>SUNY State-Operated Campuses Federal Stimulus Spending. Funding provided through various Federal stimulus bills </span><span>resulted in greater Federal spending projections for SUNY State-operated campuses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>FEMA Reimbursement of Eligible Pandemic Expenses. The State has applied for FEMA reimbursement for expenses </span><span>incurred to date related to emergency protective measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including home test kits for </span><span>schools. The Updated Financial Plan assumes reimbursement of $800 million in FY 2023, $425 million in FY 2024, and </span><span>$225 million in FY 2025. However, there is no assurance that FEMA will approve claims for the State to receive </span><span>reimbursement in the amounts or State fiscal years as projected in the Updated Financial Plan.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>FEMA Local Pass-Through Funding. Funding from this program is assumed to flow through the Updated Financial Plan </span><span>to reimburse local entities for their Federal share of COVID-19 claims submitted to FEMA.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund Non-Entitlement Pass-Through. The ARP requires states to pass-through the </span><span>allocations to non-entitlement cities, towns, and villages. The State distributed $387 million to local governments in FY </span><span>2022 and distributed an additional $387 million to local governments in FY 2023, for a total of $774 million overall.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Homeowner Assistance Fund. This program provides services to ensure that homeowners experiencing economic </span><span>hardships associated with the pandemic can stay in their homes.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>HEAP. The ARP provided supplemental funding to the existing HEAP that helps low-income households pay the cost of </span><span>heating, cooling, and weatherizing their homes.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund. The ARP created the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund to provide funding to carry </span><span>out critical capital projects that directly enable work, education, and health monitoring, including remote options, in </span><span>response to the COVID-19 PHE. The State has been allocated $345 million for the program.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>State Small Business Credit Initiative. This program provides funding to empower small businesses to access capital </span><span>needed to invest in job-creating opportunities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Surface Transportation Block Grant. This emergency funding was provided </span><span>under the CRRSA Act to address COVID-19 impacts related to Highway Infrastructure Programs. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Federal Coronavirus Response Legislation and Action</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>80</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Federal government enacted the following legislation in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The table below </span><span>summarizes the total amount of Federal pandemic assistance available to New York State, including direct recipients of </span><span>Federal aid such as individuals, hospitals, businesses, transit authorities including the MTA, and school districts, along with </span><span>the funds expected to flow through the Updated Financial Plan.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A large portion of the Federal pandemic assistance flows directly to various recipients (e.g., tax rebates to individuals, and </span><span>loans or grants to large and small businesses) and is thus excluded from the Updated Financial Plan. In addition, on May 18, </span><span>2021, the State received $12.75 billion in Federal aid authorized in the ARP to offset revenue loss, ensure the continuation of </span><span>essential services and assistance provided by government, and assist in the PHE response and recovery efforts. These funds </span><span>are expected to be transferred to State Funds over multiple years to support eligible uses and spending. Thus, the spending </span><span>of the ARP aid to the State does not appear in Federal funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>CARES Act provides aid for Federal agencies, individuals, businesses, states, and localities, as well as $100 billion for </span><span>hospitals and health care providers, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Assistance to states through the CARES Act is generally restricted to specific purposes and includes the CRF ($5.1 billion </span><span>State allocation) and the Education Stabilization Fund ($1.2 billion State allocation). Pursuant to U.S. Treasury eligibility </span><span>guidelines, CRF funds allocated to the State were used for eligible expenses incurred, including payroll expenses for </span><span>public health and safety employees, through December 31, 2021.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>FFCRA provides aid through paid sick leave, free testing, expanded food assistance and unemployment benefits, </span><span>protections for health care workers, and increased Medicaid funding through the emergency 6.2 percent increase to the </span><span>Medicaid eFMAP during the PHE. Beginning January 1, 2023, the Consolidated Appropriations Act delinks the eFMAP </span><span>from the PHE and provides for a phase-out of enhanced funding over nine months.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>ARP Act of 2021 provides aid for Federal agencies, individuals, businesses, states and localities, and others, to respond to </span><span>the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP has provided the State with $12.75 billion in general aid (</span><span>“</span><span>recovery aid</span><span>”</span><span>) and $19.2 </span><span>billion in categorical aid for schools, universities, childcare, housing, and other purposes. The ARP also provides $10 </span><span>billion in recovery aid to localities in New York State and $7 billion directly to the MTA. The State aid provided through </span><span>the ARP is included in the Updated Financial Plan as a deposit of Federal aid to the General Fund to offset revenue loss, </span><span>ensure the continuation of essential services and assistance provided by government, and assist with the PHE response </span><span>and recovery efforts. These funds are expected to be transferred to State Funds over multiple years to support eligible </span><span>uses and spending.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Finally, the ARP established a Capital Projects Fund to provide funding to states, territories, and Tribal governments to </span><span>carry out critical capital projects directly enabling work, education, and health monitoring, including remote options, in </span><span>response to the PHE. The State has also been allocated $345 million from the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The CRRSA Act of 2021 provided funding for education, testing, tracing, vaccine distribution, unemployment assistance, </span><span>small business programs, and housing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>FEMA Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) provided grants to eligible claimants that were unemployed or partially unemployed </span><span>due to the pandemic.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provides funding for small business programs and </span><span>healthcare programs, including $75 billion for hospitals, health care providers, and testing and tracing activities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (CPRSA) of 2020 provides emergency </span><span>funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including support for vaccine development, the PHE Preparedness </span><span>program, and small businesses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in individuals filing for unemployment benefits. Such benefits </span><span>are paid from the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust Fund, which is supported by employer contributions. If there are </span><span>insufficient resources in the UI Trust Fund to pay benefits, as became the case starting in May 2020, the UI Trust Fund may </span><span>borrow from the Federal government for this purpose. As of December 31, 2022, the UI Trust Fund’s Federal loan balance was </span><span>approximately $7.97 billion. The balance in the UI Trust Fund is expected to be repaid by employers through UI contribution </span><span>rates. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In November 2021, Congress passed, and the President signed, the $1.2 trillion IIJA, including approximately $550 billion in </span><span>new authorized spending nationally on transportation, water, energy, broadband and natural resources.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>81</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The IIJA is expected to provide the State with an additional $4.6 billion in highway and bridge program aid over the life of the </span><span>Federal Aid Highway program reauthorization, as well as significant off-budget funds available across the State for transit, </span><span>rail, airport, water, and energy grid infrastructure. The annual levels of funds to the State from the IIJA are subject to Federal </span><span>budget and appropriation action in each year. </span></div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In August 2022, Congress passed, and the President signed, the $437 billion IRA (H.R. 5376), including approximately $374 </span><span>billion in energy and climate provisions, tax credits for electric vehicles and incentives for clean-energy projects. It also </span><span>contains health subsidies and drought relief while raising about $740 billion in revenue over ten years, funded through new </span><span>taxes on corporations as well as stepped-up enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Most spending in the IRA is likely to flow directly to individuals and businesses. The legislation also directs money to support </span><span>states’ climate plans and energy efficiency initiatives. The level of funds the State will receive from the IRA may be subject to </span><span>eligibility criteria of competitive grant processes. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Federal Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The amount and composition of Federal funds received by the State have changed over time because of legislative and </span><span>regulatory actions at the Federal level and will likely continue to change over the Financial Plan period. The Updated Financial </span><span>Plan may also be adversely affected by other Federal government actions including audits, disallowances, and changes to </span><span>Federal participation rates or other Medicaid rules. Any reductions in Federal aid could have a materially adverse impact on </span><span>the Updated Financial Plan. Notable areas with potential for changes in Federal funding include health care and human </span><span>services.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CMS 1115 Waiver Extension. The State submitted an 1115 waiver extension request to CMS that preserves current Medicaid </span><span>Managed Care Programs, Children’s HCBS, and self-direction of personal care services. This waiver was approved on March </span><span>31, 2022 and is effective for five years.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, DOH has developed a new programmatic amendment to the now-renewed 1115 waiver, titled New York Health </span><span>Equity Reform (NYHER): Making Targeted, Evidence-Based Investments to Address the Health Disparities Exacerbated by the </span><span>COVID-19 Pandemic. This request seeks approximately $13.5 billion in Federal funding over five years to invest in an array of </span><span>initiatives that would change the way the Medicaid program integrates and pays for social, physical, and behavioral health </span><span>care in New York State.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>After working directly with CMS and stakeholders on concepts contained in this new programmatic waiver amendment, in </span><span>accordance with Federal transparency requirements, DOH submitted a Federal public notice to the New York State Registry </span><span>on April 13, 2022 and held two public hearings on May 3, 2022 and May 10, 2022. The presentation slides, recordings, and </span><span>transcripts from both webinars are available on the DOH website. The 30-day public comment period closed on May 20, </span><span>2022 and another public hearing was held on September 28, 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>During the public comment period, DOH received 358 written comment submissions and heard from 75 speakers at the </span><span>three public hearings. DOH has worked with partner agencies to review and evaluate the approximately 1,800 comments </span><span>received and incorporated feedback from stakeholders where possible and appropriate. DOH formally submitted the final </span><span>waiver amendment application on September 2, 2022. CMS deemed the application submission complete on September 15, </span><span>2022, and the Federal public comment period ended on October 19, 2022, during which 298 unique comments were </span><span>submitted via the Medicaid.gov portal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>After submission to CMS, the review and approval process can take several months or longer. However, DOH is actively </span><span>working with CMS to achieve an approval as expeditiously as possible. DOH plans to begin the five-year waiver </span><span>demonstration period upon approval from CMS. Program implementation will begin once the amendment, or components of </span><span>the amendment, is approved and special terms and conditions are received from CMS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Healthcare/Direct Care Worker Bonus. The Updated Financial Plan assumes that the State will receive Federal approval for </span><span>Federal matching funds for the State program to provide bonus payments to eligible healthcare and direct care workers </span><span>earning less than $125,000. However, there is considerable risk that CMS may not approve all the Federal matching funds for </span><span>the bonus payments. In the event the Federal matching funds are not approved as assumed, the General Fund would incur </span><span>unbudgeted costs of up to $1.3 billion over FY 2024 and FY 2025.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>82</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State has submitted the application for reimbursement to CMS, and CMS responded on December 6, 2022 seeking </span><span>additional information. The State responded on February 15, 2023, after which CMS has an additional 90 days (May 15, 2023) </span><span>to respond.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In the interim, the State advanced the anticipated Federal share of the bonus payments for claims received to date </span><span>(approximately $680 million). DOB estimates the Federal share for the entire bonus program to be approximately $1.3 billion. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Federal Debt Limit</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On January 19, 2023 the U.S. reached its debt limit, and the Treasury Secretary subsequently announced that the Treasury </span><span>would begin extraordinary cash management measures. The Treasury Secretary further indicated that </span><span>“</span><span>it is unlikely that cash </span><span>and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June.</span><span>”</span><span> Congress would need to act to increase or suspend the </span><span>debt limit before then to avoid delaying payments and/or defaulting on debt obligations. Congress last acted on debt limit </span><span>legislation in December 2021.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Federal government default on payments, particularly for a prolonged period, could have a materially adverse effect on </span><span>national and state economies, financial markets, and intergovernmental aid payments. Specific effects on the Updated </span><span>Financial Plan resulting from a future Federal government default are unknown and impossible to predict. However, data from </span><span>past economic downturns suggests that the State’s revenue loss could be substantial if there was an economic downturn </span><span>due to a Federal default.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A payment default by the Federal government may also adversely affect the municipal bond market. Municipal issuers, </span><span>including the State and its public authorities and localities, could face higher borrowing costs and impaired access to capital </span><span>markets. This would jeopardize planned capital investments in transportation infrastructure, higher education facilities, </span><span>hazardous waste remediation, environmental projects, and economic development projects. Additionally, the market for and </span><span>market value of outstanding municipal obligations, including municipal obligations of the State and its public authorities, </span><span>could be adversely affected. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Federal Tax Law Changes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made major changes to the Federal Internal Revenue Code, most of which were </span><span>effective in tax year 2018. The TCJA made extensive changes to Federal PIT, corporate income taxes, and estate taxes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State’s income tax system interacts with the Federal system. Changes to the Federal tax code have significant flow-through</span><span> effects on State tax burdens and concomitantly on State tax receipts. One key impact of the TCJA on New York State </span><span>taxpayers is the $10,000 limit on the deductibility of SALT payments, which, until its scheduled expiration after 2025, </span><span>represents a large increase in the State’s effective tax rate relative to historical experience and may adversely affect New York </span><span>State’s economic competitiveness.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Moreover, the TCJA contains numerous provisions that may adversely affect residential real estate prices in New York State </span><span>and elsewhere, of which the SALT deduction limit is the most significant. A loss of wealth associated with a decline in home </span><span>prices could have a significant impact on household spending in the State through the wealth effect, whereby consumers </span><span>perceive the rise and fall of the value of an asset, such as a home, as a corresponding increase or decline in income, causing </span><span>them to alter their spending practices. Reductions in household spending by New York residents, if they were to occur, would </span><span>be expected to result in lower sales for the State’s businesses which, in turn, would cause further reductions in economic </span><span>activity and employment. Lastly, falling home prices could result in homeowners delaying the sale of their homes. The </span><span>combined impact of lower home prices and fewer sales transactions could result in lower real estate transfer tax collections. </span><span>The TCJA changes may intensify migration pressures and decrease the value of home prices, thereby posing risks to the </span><span>State’s tax base and current Financial Plan projections. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>State Response to Federal Tax Law Changes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>PTET. As part of the State’s continuing response to Federal tax law changes and in connection with the FY 2022 Enacted </span><span>Budget, the State Legislature enacted an optional PTET on the New York- sourced income of partnerships and S corporations. </span><span>Qualifying entities that elect to pay PTET pay a tax of up to 10.9 percent on their taxable income at the partnership or </span><span>corporation level, and their individual partners, members and shareholders receive a refundable tax credit equal to the </span><span>proportionate or pro rata share of taxes paid by the electing entity. Additionally, the program includes a resident tax credit </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>83</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>that allows for reciprocity with other states that have implemented substantially similar taxes, which currently include </span><span>Connecticut and New Jersey.</span></div> <div> <div><span>DOB expects that, on a multi-year basis, the PTET will be revenue neutral for the State as individual taxpayers claim credits </span><span>against their PIT liabilities that reflect PTET payments made at the entity level. However, because the PTET credits are not </span><span>necessarily realized by taxpayers within the same fiscal year that PTET revenue is received by the State, the PTET is not </span><span>revenue-neutral to the State within each fiscal year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan includes estimates for PTET receipts and the corresponding decrease in PIT receipts. The overall </span><span>effect on projected receipts to the Revenue Bond Tax Fund (RBTF), to which 50 percent of both PIT and PTET receipts are </span><span>deposited, is that PTET increased FY 2022 receipts and is projected to decrease FY 2023 receipts by a significant amount. See </span><span>the </span><span>“</span><span>PTET – Financial Plan Impact</span><span>”</span><span> herein for a table summarizing projected PTET receipts and the associated change in </span><span>projected PIT collections. Projections are based on limited experience of taxpayer behavior to date, and there can be no </span><span>assurance that such projections will be realized.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that State and local income taxes imposed on and paid by a </span><span>partnership or an S corporation on its income, such as the PTET, are allowable as a Federal deduction to taxable income. In </span><span>November 2020, the IRS released Notice 2020-75, which announced that the Treasury and IRS intend to issue clarifying </span><span>regulations with respect to such pass-through taxes. The IRS has not yet issued such proposed regulations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Charitable Gifts Trust Fund. Other State tax reforms enacted in tax year 2018 to mitigate issues arising from the TCJA </span><span>included decoupling many State tax provisions from the Federal changes, creation of an optional payroll tax program, the </span><span>Employer Compensation Expense Program (ECEP), and establishment of a new State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Charitable Gifts Trust Fund was established in tax year 2018 to accept gifts for the purposes of funding health care and </span><span>education in New York State. Taxpayers who itemize deductions were able to claim these charitable contributions as </span><span>deductions on their Federal and State income tax returns. Any taxpayer who donates may also claim a State tax credit equal </span><span>to 85 percent of the donation amount for the tax year after the donation is made. However, after enactment of this program, </span><span>the IRS issued regulations that impaired the ability of taxpayers to deduct donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund from </span><span>Federal taxable income while receiving State tax credits for such donations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Through FY 2022, the State received $93 million in charitable gifts deposited to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund for healthcare </span><span>and education ($58 million and $35 million, respectively). Charitable Gifts to date have been appropriated and used for the </span><span>authorized purposes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of State tax reforms enacted in 2018, taxpayers may claim reimbursement from the State for interest on </span><span>underpayments of Federal tax liability for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years if the underpayments arise from reliance on the </span><span>2018 amendments to State Tax Law. To receive reimbursement, taxpayers are required to submit their reimbursement claims </span><span>to DTF within 60 days of making an interest payment to the IRS. To date, the State has not received any claims for </span><span>reimbursement of interest on underpayments of Federal tax liability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan does not include any estimate of the magnitude of the possible interest expense to the State. Any </span><span>such interest expense would depend on several factors including the rate of participation in the ECEP; magnitude of </span><span>donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund; amount of time between the due date of the Federal return and the date any IRS </span><span>underpayment determination is issued; Federal interest rate applied; aggregate amount of Federal tax underpayments </span><span>attributable to reliance on the 2018 amendments to State Tax Law; and frequency at which taxpayers submit timely </span><span>reimbursement claims to the State.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Litigation Challenging Limitation of Charitable Contributions Deductibility. </span><span>On June 13, 2019, the IRS issued final </span><span>regulations (Treasury Decision 9864) that provided final rules and additional guidance with respect to the availability of </span><span>Federal income tax deductions for charitable contributions when a taxpayer receives or expects to receive a State or local tax </span><span>credit for such charitable contributions. These regulations require a taxpayer to reduce the Federal charitable contribution </span><span>deduction by the amount of any State tax credit received due to such charitable contribution. This rule does not apply if the </span><span>value of the State tax credit does not exceed 15 percent of the charitable contribution. Regulations were made retroactive to </span><span>August 27, 2018 (the date on which the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS first published proposed regulatory changes).</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>84</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>On July 17, 2019, the State, joined by Connecticut and New Jersey, filed a Federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for </span><span>the Southern District of New York challenging these charitable contribution regulations. Among other things, the lawsuit </span><span>seeks to restore the full Federal income tax deduction for charitable contributions, regardless of the amount of any State tax </span><span>credit provided to taxpayers as a result of contributions made to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund, in accordance with </span><span>precedent since 1917. The Federal defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment on </span><span>December 23, 2019. The states responded and filed their own motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020. Briefing </span><span>on the motions was completed in July 2020. The district court denied the states’ request for oral argument on March 16, </span><span>2021, but a decision on the outstanding motions to dismiss, and cross-motions for summary judgment, remains pending.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Major Operating Programs</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beginning in FY 2012, the State enacted legislation intended to limit the year-to-year growth in the State’s two largest local </span><span>assistance programs, School Aid and Medicaid. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>School Aid</span><span>. In FY 2012, the State enacted a School Aid growth cap that was intended to limit the growth in School Aid to the </span><span>annual growth in State Personal Income, as calculated in the Personal Income Growth Index (PIGI). Beginning in FY 2021, the </span><span>statutory PIGI for School Aid was amended to limit School Aid increases to no more than the average annual income growth </span><span>over a ten-year period. This change reduces volatility in allowable growth and aligns the School Aid cap with the statutory </span><span>Medicaid cap utilized prior to FY 2023. Prior to FY 2021, the PIGI generally relied on a one-year change in personal income.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The authorized School Aid increases exceeded the indexed levels in FYs 2014 through 2019, were within the indexed levels in </span><span>FYs 2020 and 2021, and again exceeded the indexed level in FY 2022 and 2023. The proposed increase in School Aid for SY </span><span>2024 of $3.1 billion (10.0 percent) is above the indexed PIGI rate of 4.2 percent. This $3.1 billion increase includes a $2.7 </span><span>billion increase in Foundation Aid</span><span>3</span><span> as part of the final year of the three-year phase-in of the formula and a 3 percent </span><span>“</span><span>due </span><span>minimum</span><span>”</span><span> increase for districts whose annual Foundation Aid levels exceed their full funding level targets. The increase also </span><span>includes a $125 million investment in State-funded full- day prekindergarten programming for four-year-old children, </span><span>including a $100 million formula- based allocation and a $25 million grant to be competitively awarded. In SY 2025 and </span><span>beyond, School Aid is projected to increase in line with the rate allowed under the School Aid growth cap.</span> <hr/> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Foundation Aid is formula-based, unrestricted aid provided to school districts. It is the largest aid category within School Aid and is projected to total </span><span>$24.1 billion in SY 2024. The Foundation Aid formula consists of four components: a State-specified expected expenditure per pupil to which the </span><span>State and districts will contribute, a State- specified expected minimum local contribution per pupil, the number of aid-eligible pupil units in the </span><span>district, and additional adjustments based on phase-in factors and minimum or maximum increases. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Medicaid</span><span>. Approximately 85 percent of DOH State Funds Medicaid spending growth is subject to the Global Cap. Prior to FY </span><span>2023, the Global Cap was previously calculated using the ten-year rolling average of the medical component of the CPI for all </span><span>urban consumers and thus allowed for growth attributable to increasing costs, though not increasing utilization. To </span><span>accommodate growth in factors not currently indexed under the Global Cap and reflect recent trends, beginning in FY 2023, </span><span>the allowable spending growth for activities under the Global Cap is set at the five-year rolling average of health care </span><span>spending, using projections from the CMS Actuary. The FY 2023 Executive Budget and Enacted Budget utilized the CMS </span><span>Actuary projections issued on March 24, 2020, which were the most recent published data available in developing the </span><span>Executive Budget proposal and during the legislative budget negotiation period. The FY 2024 Executive Budget incorporates </span><span>multi-year revisions to the index consistent with updated CMS Actuary projections issued on March 28, 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The statutory provisions of the Global Cap grant the Commissioner of Health (the </span><span>“</span><span>Commissioner</span><span>”</span><span>) certain powers to limit </span><span>Medicaid disbursements to the level authorized by the Global Cap and allow for flexibility in adjusting Medicaid projections to </span><span>meet unanticipated costs resulting from a disaster. The Commissioner’s powers are intended to limit the annual growth rate </span><span>to the levels set by the Global Cap for the then-current fiscal year, through actions which may include reducing </span><span>reimbursement rates to providers. These actions may be dependent upon timely Federal approvals and other elements of the </span><span>program that govern implementation. Additional State share Medicaid spending, outside of the Global Cap, includes State </span><span>costs for the takeover of Medicaid growth from local governments and reimbursement to providers for increased minimum </span><span>wage costs. It should be further noted that General Fund Medicaid spending remains sensitive to revenue performance in the </span><span>State’s HCRA fund that finances approximately one-quarter of DOH State-share Medicaid costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Since the enactment of the Global Cap, the portion of State Funds Medicaid spending subject to the Global Cap has remained </span><span>at or below indexed levels. However, in certain fiscal years, DOH has taken management actions, including adjustments to </span><span>the timing of Medicaid payments consistent with contractual terms, to ensure compliance with the Global Cap. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>85</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Public Health Insurance Programs/Public Assistance</span><span>. Historically, the State has experienced growth in Medicaid enrollment </span><span>and public assistance caseloads during economic downturns due mainly to increases in unemployment. Many people who </span><span>were laid off or otherwise experienced a decrease in family income in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic became </span><span>qualifying enrollees and began to participate in public health insurance programs such as Medicaid, EP, and Child Health Plus </span><span>(CHP). Participants in these programs remain eligible for coverage for 12 continuous months regardless of changes in </span><span>employment or income levels that may otherwise make them ineligible. Estimated costs for increased enrollment are </span><span>budgeted in the Updated Financial Plan through FY 2025. Beginning in June of 2023, the State will begin reprocessing </span><span>eligibility determinations for approximately 9 million public health insurance enrollees to be completed over a fourteen </span><span>month period, consistent with CMS requirements. Compared to the Mid-Year Financial Plan, Medicaid enrollment is expected </span><span>to be significantly higher than previously forecasted, adding approximately $1.6 billion in new Medicaid costs over the multi-year</span><span> Financial Plan, which is a significant contribution to the reported Medicaid deficits in FY 2026 and FY 2027.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Likewise, the rise in unemployment and decrease in family income during the pandemic have resulted in increased public </span><span>assistance caseloads, particularly in New York City. In addition to existing family and safety net assistance programs, the FY </span><span>2023 Enacted Budget included a recurring State-funded rent supplement program to assist individuals and families. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Extraordinary Aid to Hospitals</span><span>. The pandemic further stressed the financial stability of hospitals responsible for supporting </span><span>medical needs in underserved communities across the State, including those with higher rates of uninsured and government </span><span>payor mix. Accordingly, the FY 2023 Enacted Budget committed an additional $800 million in one-time resources in FY 2023, </span><span>in addition to $984 million in ongoing annual base support, to strengthen the financial position of certain financially </span><span>distressed providers. The importance of the hospital industry to local communities for purposes of accessing critical health </span><span>care services, as well as other social and economic benefits, creates the potential for increased cost pressure within the </span><span>Financial Plan should the State continue to assist hospitals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Opioid Settlement Fund</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Attorney General (AG) and the Department of Financial Services (DFS) have reached significant opioid related </span><span>settlements with several corporations for their roles in helping fuel the opioid epidemic.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Johnson &amp; Johnson, the parent company of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is expected to pay the State and its </span><span>subdivisions up to $230 million.

Pursuant </span><span>to that plan, the owners of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family, were to pay the State and its subdivisions at least $200 </span><span>million as part of a $4.5 billion bankruptcy plan over a nine-year period commencing in 2022. The settlement between </span><span>the State and Purdue Pharma would shut down Purdue Pharma, prevent the Sackler family from participating in the </span><span>opioids business prospectively, and establish a substantial document repository of 30 million plus documents. Following </span><span>an appeal, on December 16, 2021, a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated the confirmation of </span><span>Purdue Pharma’s plan. In re: Purdue Pharma L.P., Case No. 21-cv-07532-CM (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2021). The District Court </span><span>held that the law does not allow a bankruptcy plan to give releases to individuals who are not bankrupt. Subsequently, </span><span>Purdue Pharma appealed to the Second Circuit, which held oral argument on April 29, 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Drug distributors McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health Inc., and Amerisource Bergen Drug Corporation will pay the </span><span>State and its subdivisions up to $1.0 billion over 18 years and develop a monitoring mechanism to collect and analyze </span><span>opioid drug distribution.

This section discusses contributions from the State, including the Judiciary, to the NYSLRS, which account for </span><span>the majority of the State’s pension costs.</span><span>4</span><span> All projections are based on estimated market returns and numerous actuarial </span><span>assumptions which, if unrealized, could adversely and materially affect these projections.</span> <hr/> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>The State’s aggregate pension costs also include State employees in the Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS) for both the SUNY and the State </span><span>Education Department (SED), the Optional Retirement Program (OR) for both SUNY and SED, and the New York State Voluntary Defined </span><span>Contribution Plan (VDC).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>New York State Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) Section 11 directs the actuary for NYSLRS to provide regular </span><span>reports on the Systems’ experience and to propose assumptions and methods for the actuarial valuations. Employer </span><span>contribution rates for NYSLRS are determined based on investment performance in the Common Retirement Fund and </span><span>actuarial assumptions recommended by the Retirement System's Actuary and approved by the State Comptroller. Pension </span><span>estimates are based on the actuarial report issued in August 2021.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On August 25, 2021, the Comptroller announced reductions in employer contribution rates for both ERS and PFRS which will </span><span>impact payments in FY 2023. This reduction was primarily accomplished by realizing the entire benefit of the FY 2021 </span><span>investment return of 33.55 percent in the valuation of assets available to pay retirement benefits, rather than the standard </span><span>approach of </span><span>“</span><span>asset smoothing</span><span>”</span><span> the return over a five-year period to guard against volatility in investment returns. This action </span><span>—</span><span> termed </span><span>“</span><span>the market-restart</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>—</span><span> offset the Comptroller's simultaneous action of lowering the long-term assumed rate of </span><span>return on investments from 6.8 percent to 5.9 percent, which, in and of itself, would have resulted in a substantial increase in </span><span>the FY 2023 employer contribution rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result of the Comptroller's actions, the estimated average employer contribution rate for ERS will be lowered from 16.2 </span><span>percent to 11.6 percent of payroll, and the estimated average employer contribution rate for PFRS will be reduced from 28.3 </span><span>percent to 27 percent of payroll. Employers who have previously participated in the Contribution Stabilization Program, </span><span>including the State, are required to contribute at the higher graded (amortization) rate of 14.1 percent for ERS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On September 1, 2022, the Comptroller announced an increase in employer contribution rates for both ERS and PFRS which </span><span>will impact payments in FY 2024. The average employer contribution rate for ERS increased from 11.6 percent to 13.1 percent </span><span>of payroll, and the average employer contribution rate for PFRS increased from 27 percent to 27.8 percent of payroll. The </span><span>increase in rates was primarily attributed to salary increases for active members and a 3 percent COLA increase to most </span><span>retirees’ pension benefits. State law requires that COLA payments be calculated based on 50 percent of the annual rate of </span><span>inflation, as measured at the end of the State fiscal year (March 31). The annual COLA increase is required to be at least 1 </span><span>percent, but no more than 3 percent, and is typically applied on up to the first $18,000 of a retiree’s pension.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the change in contribution rates, the Comptroller authorized a change in the asset smoothing methodology </span><span>from five to eight years. Asset smoothing is used to mitigate the impact to employer contribution rates as a result of any </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>88</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>unexpected gains or losses in annual investment returns. This is achieved by recognizing any deviation from the assumed </span><span>rate of return, currently at 5.9 percent, in equal proportions. Increasing the asset smoothing methodology from five to eight </span><span>years will dampen the effects of year-to-year volatility in the Common Retirement Fund’s returns and the impact on employer </span><span>rates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Updated Financial Plan reflects the actuarial changes approved by the Comptroller, including revised ERS/PFRS pension </span><span>estimates of $1.8 billion for FY 2023 and $2 billion for FY 2024 based on the December 2022 estimate provided by the </span><span>Actuary. Approximately $67 million in pension interest savings was achieved from the payment of the State’s FY 2023 </span><span>ERS/PFRS bill in May 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>This estimate also reflects the payoff of all prior year amortization balances. The ERS (non-Judiciary) and PFRS portion was </span><span>fully repaid in March 2021, and the Judiciary portion was fully repaid in October 2021. Collectively, this reduced the FY 2023 </span><span>cost by $331 million from prior estimates. The total payoff of outstanding prior-year amortization balances was $1 billion, </span><span>resulting in interest savings of roughly $76 million over the Financial Plan period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Comptroller does not forecast pension liability estimates for the later years of the Updated Financial Plan. Thus, </span><span>estimates for FY 2025 and beyond are developed by DOB. DOB’s forecast assumes growth in the salary base consistent with </span><span>collective bargaining agreements and a lower rate of return compared to the current assumed rate of return by NYSLRS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Security</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The CARES Act allowed employers, including the State, to defer the deposit and payment of the employer’s share of Social </span><span>Security taxes through December 2020, and for the deferral to be repaid, interest free, in two equal installments no later than </span><span>December 31, 2022. The Executive and the Judiciary have repaid the interest-free loan in full. SUNY is expected to remit its </span><span>final repayment of $24 million by December 2022. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State employees become eligible for post-employment benefits (e.g., health insurance) if they reach retirement while working </span><span>for the State; are enrolled in either the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) or the NYSHIP opt-out program at </span><span>the time they reach retirement; and have the required years of eligible service. The cost of providing post-retirement health </span><span>insurance is shared between the State and the retired employee. Contributions are established by law and may be amended </span><span>by the Legislature. The State pays its share of costs on a PAYGO basis as required by law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State Comptroller adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement (GASBS) 75, Accounting and Financial </span><span>Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, for the State’s Basic Financial Statements for FY 2019. GASBS </span><span>75, which replaces GASBS 45 and GASBS 57, addresses accounting and financial reporting for OPEB that is provided to the </span><span>employees of state and local governmental employers. GASBS 75 establishes standards for recognizing and measuring </span><span>liabilities and expenses/expenditures, as well as identifying the methods and assumptions required to be used to project </span><span>benefit payments, discount projected benefit payments to their actuarial determined present value, and attribute that present </span><span>value to periods of employee service. Specifically, GASBS 75 now requires that the full liability be recognized.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State’s total OPEB liability equals the employer's share of the actuarial determined present value of projected benefit </span><span>payments attributed to past periods of employee service. The total OPEB obligation less any OPEB assets set aside in an OPEB </span><span>trust or similar arrangement represents the net OPEB obligation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As reported in the State’s Basic Financial Statements for FY 2022, the total ending OPEB liability for FY 2022 was $65.7 billion </span><span>($52.1 billion for the State and $13.6 billion for SUNY). The total OPEB liability as of March 31, 2022, was measured as of </span><span>March 31, 2021, and was determined using an actuarial valuation as of April 1, 2020, with updated procedures used to roll </span><span>forward the total OPEB liability to March 2021. The total beginning OPEB liability for FY 2022 was $75.8 billion ($60.3 billion </span><span>for the State and $15.5 billion for SUNY). The total OPEB liability was calculated using the Entry Age Normal cost method. The </span><span>discount rate is based on the Bond Buyer 20-year general obligation municipal bond index rate on March 31 (2.84 percent in </span><span>FY 2021 and 2.34 percent in FY 2022). The total OPEB liability decreased by $10.1 billion (13.3 percent) during FY 2022 </span><span>primarily due to updated medical trend assumptions based on current anticipation of future costs, and projected claim costs </span><span>were updated based on the recent claims experience for the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan and premium rates </span><span>for the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>89</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The contribution requirements of NYSHIP members and the State are established by, and may be amended by, the </span><span>Legislature. The State is not required to provide funding above the PAYGO amount necessary to provide current benefits to </span><span>retirees. The State continues to fund these costs, along with all other employee health care expenses, on a PAYGO basis, </span><span>meaning the State pays these costs as they become due.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The RHBTF was created in FY 2018 as a qualified trust under GASBS 74 and is authorized to reserve money for the payment </span><span>of health benefits of retired employees and their dependents. Unlike State pensions, which are pre-funded, future retiree </span><span>health care costs are unfunded, meaning no money is set aside to pay these future expenses. The State pays these expenses </span><span>each year as they come due. Under current law, the State may deposit into the RHBTF, in any given fiscal year, up to 1.5 </span><span>percent of total then-current unfunded actuarial accrued OPEB liability ($65.7 billion on March 31, 2022). The FY 2023 </span><span>Enacted Budget increased the maximum allowable deposit from 0.5 percent of the OPEB liability to 1.5 percent of the </span><span>outstanding OPEB liability. The Updated Financial Plan reflects a deposit of $320 million in FY 2022 and planned deposits of </span><span>$920 million in FY 2023 and $375 million annually thereafter, fiscal conditions permitting. These deposits, which were </span><span>allocated in prior Financial Plan updates, are the first deposits to the RHBTF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>GASBS 74 and 75 are not expected to alter the Updated Financial Plan PAYGO projections for health insurance costs. DOB’s </span><span>methodology for forecasting these costs over a multi-year period already incorporates factors and considerations consistent </span><span>with the new actuarial methods and calculations required by the GASBS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Debt</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Bond Market and Credit Ratings</span><span>. Successful execution of the Updated Financial Plan is dependent on the State's ability to </span><span>market bonds. The State finances much of its capital spending, in the first instance, from the General Fund or STIP, which it </span><span>then reimburses with proceeds from the sale of bonds. An inability of the State to sell bonds or notes at the level or on the </span><span>timetable it expects could have a material and adverse impact on the State’s financial position and the implementation of its </span><span>Capital Plan. The success of projected public sales of municipal bonds is subject to prevailing market conditions and related </span><span>ratings issued by national credit rating agencies, among other factors. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States </span><span>temporarily disrupted the municipal bond market in 2020, and the emergence of future variants could further disrupt the </span><span>municipal bond market. In addition, future developments in the financial markets, including possible changes in Federal tax </span><span>law relating to the taxation of interest on municipal bonds, may affect the market for outstanding State-supported and State-related</span><span> debt.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of the date of the AIS Update, the major rating agencies </span><span>—</span><span> Fitch, Kroll, Moody’s, and S&amp;P </span><span>—</span><span> have assigned the State </span><span>general credit ratings of AA+, AA+, Aa1, and AA+, respectively. The State's rating has a stable outlook from all four rating </span><span>agencies. These ratings reflect the State's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and commitment to strong </span><span>reserve levels. The most recent rating action was on April 13, 2022, when Moody’s raised the State’s credit rating from Aa2 to </span><span>Aa1, noting </span><span>“</span><span>a significant increase in resources combined with agile fiscal management that has resulted in balanced or </span><span>nearly balanced budgets projected through the State's five-year financial plan.</span><span>”</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Debt Reform Act Limit</span><span>. The Debt Reform Act of 2000 (</span><span>“</span><span>Debt Reform Act</span><span>”</span><span>) restricts the issuance of State-supported debt </span><span>funding to capital purposes only and limits the maximum term of bonds to 30 years. The Act limits the amount of new State-supported</span><span> debt to 4 percent of State personal income, and new State-supported debt service costs to 5 percent of All Funds </span><span>receipts. The restrictions apply to State-supported debt issued after April 1, 2000. DOB, as administrator of the Debt Reform </span><span>Act, determined that the State complied with the statutory caps in the most recent calculation period (FY 2022).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State enacted legislation that suspended certain provisions of the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022 bond </span><span>issuances as part of the State’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, State-supported debt issued in FY 2021 </span><span>and FY 2022 was not limited to capital purposes and is not counted towards the statutory caps on debt outstanding and debt </span><span>service.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Following this temporary two year suspension as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the provisions of the Debt Reform Act </span><span>were reinstated for State-supported debt issued in FY 2023 and beyond. One limited exception to the Debt Reform Act </span><span>remains for issuances undertaken by the State for MTA capital projects which may be issued with maximum maturities </span><span>longer than 30 years. This allows bonds to be issued over the full useful life of the assets being financed, subject to Federal </span><span>tax law limitations, and is consistent with the rules that would have been in effect if the projects had been directly financed by </span><span>the MTA.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>90</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Current projections anticipate that State-supported debt outstanding and State-supported debt service will continue to </span><span>remain below the limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act, in part reflecting the statutory suspension of the debt caps during </span><span>FY 2021 and FY 2022.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Based on the most recent personal income and debt outstanding forecasts, the available debt capacity under the debt </span><span>outstanding cap is expected to decline from $21.6 billion in FY 2023 to a low point of $290 million in FY 2028. This </span><span>calculation includes the estimated impact of funding capital commitments with State bonds. The debt service on State-supported</span><span> debt subject to the statutory cap is projected at $2.7 billion in FY 2023, or roughly $8.7 billion below the statutory </span><span>debt service limit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State uses personal income estimates published by the Federal government, specifically the Bureau of Economic Analysis </span><span>(BEA), to calculate the cap on debt outstanding, as required by statute. The BEA revises these estimates on a quarterly basis </span><span>and such revisions can be significant. For Federal reporting purposes, BEA reassigns income from the state where it was </span><span>earned to the state in which a person resides, for situations where a person lives and earns income in different states (the </span><span>“</span><span>residency adjustment</span><span>”</span><span>). The BEA residency adjustment has the effect of reducing reported New York State personal income </span><span>because income earned in New York by non-residents regularly exceeds income earned in other states by New York residents. </span><span>The State taxes all personal income earned in New York, regardless of place of residency.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the FY 2024 Executive Budget, the State proposes new bond-financed capital commitments that would add $4 billion in </span><span>new debt over the five-year Capital Plan period. The new capital commitments and FY 2024 Executive Budget personal </span><span>income forecast decrease debt capacity, which is offset by the assumption that the State will issue bonds on a slower </span><span>schedule and higher underspending on capital projects than previously assumed. Debt capacity also reflects the suspension </span><span>of the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022 issuances in response to the COVID- 19 pandemic, as discussed previously. </span><span>The State may adjust capital spending priorities and debt financing practices from time to time to preserve available debt </span><span>capacity and stay within the statutory limits, as events warrant. As part of the FY 2024 Executive Budget, the State has set </span><span>aside $1 billion in a debt reduction reserve that can be used, as needed, for debt management actions in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Condition of New York State Localities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State’s localities rely in part on State aid to balance their budgets and meet their cash requirements. As such, </span><span>unanticipated financial needs among localities can adversely affect the State’s Updated Financial Plan projections. The wide-ranging</span><span> economic, health, and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have adversely affected the City of New York and </span><span>surrounding localities. Localities outside New York City, including cities and counties, have also experienced financial </span><span>problems, and have been allocated additional State assistance during the last several State fiscal years. In 2013, the Financial </span><span>Restructuring Board for Local Governments was created to aid distressed local governments. The Restructuring Board </span><span>performs comprehensive reviews and provides grants and loans on the condition of implementing recommended efficiency </span><span>initiatives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>MTA</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The MTA operates public transportation in the New York City metropolitan area, including subways, buses, commuter rail, </span><span>and tolled vehicle crossings. The services provided by MTA and its operating agencies are integral to the economy of New </span><span>York City and the surrounding metropolitan region, as well as to the economy of the State. MTA operations are funded mainly </span><span>from fare and toll revenue, dedicated taxes, and subsidies from the State and New York City.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>MTA Capital Plans also rely on significant direct contributions from the State and New York City. The State is directly </span><span>contributing $9.1 billion to the MTA’s 2015-19 Capital Plan and $3.1 billion to the MTA’s 2020-24 Capital Plan. These State </span><span>commitment levels represent substantial increases from the funding levels for prior MTA Capital Plans (2010-2014: $770 </span><span>million; 2005-2009: $1.45 billion). In addition, a substantial amount of new funding to the MTA was authorized in the FY 2020 </span><span>Enacted Budget as part of a comprehensive reform plan expected to generate an estimated $25 billion in financing for the </span><span>MTA’s 2020-2024 Capital Plan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe declines in MTA ridership and traffic in 2020, and ridership remains significantly </span><span>below pre-pandemic levels. To offset operating losses to MTA’s Financial Plan from the estimated fare, toll, and dedicated </span><span>revenue loss attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant Federal operating aid is provided to the MTA from the CARES </span><span>Act ($4 billion), CRRSA Act ($4.1 billion), and the ARP ($7 billion). The MTA also borrowed $2.9 billion through the Federal </span><span>Reserve’s Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF).</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>91</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the MTA’s operating budget extend after the Federal funds are fully </span><span>spent, and without additional Federal aid, the MTA will need to consider additional actions to balance its future budgets. </span><span>Risks to MTA's current financial projections include, but are not limited to, the level and pace at which ridership will return, </span><span>the economic conditions of the MTA region, the ability to implement cost controls and savings actions, and the ability to </span><span>implement biennial fare and toll increases. If additional resources are provided by the State, either through additional </span><span>subsidies or new revenues, it could have a material and adverse impact on the State's Updated Financial Plan.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The State has taken action to address MTA financing issues that arose during the pandemic. Specifically, the pandemic </span><span>adversely affected credit ratings on MTA Transportation Revenue Bonds, which increased the cost of borrowing for the MTA. </span><span>As a result, the State has issued PIT revenue bonds since the start of FY 2021 to fund $5.5 billion of the State’s portion of the </span><span>MTA’s 2015-19 Capital Plan. Previously, the Financial Plan assumed that the projects would be bonded by the MTA but </span><span>funded by the State through additional operating aid to the MTA. The Updated Financial Plan now assumes the State will </span><span>fund its direct contributions to the MTA 2015-19 and 2020-24 Capital Plans through PIT and Sales Tax revenue bonds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Risks And Ongoing Concerns</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>New York State government, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology </span><span>environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of personal, private, or sensitive information, the State and </span><span>its authorities, agencies and public benefit corporations, as well as its political subdivisions (including counties, cities, towns, </span><span>villages and school districts) face multiple cyber threats involving, among others, hacking, viruses, malware and other </span><span>electronic attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems. Entities or individuals may attempt to gain </span><span>unauthorized access to the State’s digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or information or causing </span><span>operational disruption and damage. In addition, the tactics used in malicious attacks to obtain unauthorized access to digital </span><span>networks and systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, the State </span><span>may be unable to fully anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To mitigate the risk of business operations impact and/or damage from cyber incidents or cyber- attacks, the State invests in </span><span>multiple forms of cybersecurity and operational controls. The State’s Chief Information Security Office (CISO) within the </span><span>State’s Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) maintains policies and standards, programs, and services relating to </span><span>the security of State government networks, and annually assesses the maturity of State agencies' cyber posture through the </span><span>Nationwide Cyber Security Review. In addition, the CISO maintains the New York State Cyber Command Center team, which </span><span>provides a security operations center, digital forensics capabilities, and cyber incident reporting and response. The CISO also </span><span>distributes real-time advisories and alerts, provides managed security services, and implements statewide information, </span><span>security awareness and training.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In February 2022, the Governor announced the creation of a Joint Security Operations Center (JSOC) that will serve as the </span><span>center for joint local, state, and Federal cybersecurity efforts, including data collection, response efforts and information </span><span>sharing. A partnership launched with New York City and other major cities and cybersecurity leaders across the State, the </span><span>JSOC is intended to provide a statewide view of the cyber-threat landscape. The initiative is designed to increase </span><span>collaboration on threat intelligence, reduce response times, and yield faster and more effective remediation in the event of a </span><span>major cyber incident. The FY 2024 Executive Budget provides funding to expand the shared services program to help local </span><span>governments and other regional partners acquire and deploy high quality cybersecurity services to bolster their cyber </span><span>defenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Occasionally, intrusions into State digital systems have been detected but they have generally been contained. While </span><span>cybersecurity procedures and controls are routinely reviewed and tested, there can be no assurance that such security and </span><span>operational control measures will be completely successful at guarding against future cyber threats and attacks. The results </span><span>of any successful attacks could adversely impact business operations and/or damage State digital networks and systems, or </span><span>State and local infrastructure, and the costs of remediation could be substantial.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The State has also adopted regulations designed to protect the financial services industry from cyberattacks. Banks, </span><span>insurance companies and other covered entities regulated by DFS are, unless eligible for limited exemptions, required to: (a) </span><span>maintain a cybersecurity program, (b) create written cybersecurity policies and perform risk assessments, (c) designate </span><span>someone with responsibility to oversee the cybersecurity program, (d) annually certify compliance with the cybersecurity </span><span>regulations, and (e) report to DFS cybersecurity events that have a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>92</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The government members, or </span><span>“</span><span>stockholders,</span><span>”</span><span> usually make initial </span><span>capital contributions to the supranational entity and, in many cases, are committed to make additional capital contributions </span><span>if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of the supranational </span><span>entity will continue to make any necessary additional capital contributions. If such contributions are not made, the entity </span><span>may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, certain of the Funds may have limited legal recourse in </span><span>the event of default, and certain of the Funds may lose money on such investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal Securities. </span><span> </span><span>As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in </span><span>shares of each Municipal Bond Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as </span><span>general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of </span><span>each Municipal Bond Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an </span><span>individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Municipal Bond Fund </span><span>makes distributions or you sell Municipal Bond Fund shares. In general, each Municipal Bond Fund seeks to produce income </span><span>that is generally exempt from federal income tax and will not benefit investors in tax deferred retirement accounts such as </span><span>IRAs or investors not subject to federal income tax. Further, the iShares California Muni Bond ETF generally invests in </span><span>securities that produce income that is generally exempt from California's income tax, which will not provide any state tax </span><span>benefit to investors who are not subject to California's state income tax and the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF generally </span><span>invests in securities that produce income that is generally exempt from New York's income tax, which will not provide any </span><span>state tax benefit to investors who are not subject to New York's state income tax.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In response to the national economic downturn in recent years, governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among </span><span>federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing </span><span>significant reductions in revenues and are consequently experiencing difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these </span><span>state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may experience </span><span>ratings downgrades of their debt.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or </span><span>foreign investor in, certain countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be </span><span>particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial </span><span>regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure. Circumstances </span><span>could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the </span><span>legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the </span><span>global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are strained relations between the U.S. and a number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain </span><span>European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, </span><span>it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced </span><span>increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy </span><span>and many of the issuers in which a Fund invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </span><span> </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, </span><span>times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the </span><span>U.S. government may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ </span><span>by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury </span><span>obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing </span><span>arrangements, a downgrade could also result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the </span><span>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and global economy.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>93</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost </span><span>higher and lead the government to issue additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises </span><span>concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. If market </span><span>participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could decline, </span><span>thus increasing inflationary pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported </span><span>goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic </span><span>downturns. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </span><span>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period that </span><span>shareholders own shares of a Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of </span><span>the U.S., circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal, such as reaching the </span><span>legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in losses to a Fund and substantial negative consequences for the </span><span>U.S. economy and the global financial system.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk. </span><span> </span><span>In certain circumstances, a Fund’s securities may be valued using techniques other than market quotations. </span><span>The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use of another methodology </span><span>or if the value had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods other than market </span><span>quotations, including </span><span>“</span><span>fair valued</span><span>”</span><span> securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next </span><span>than would be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell a security for </span><span>the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its </span><span>established value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Africa.</span><span>  </span><span>Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks </span><span>including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including </span><span>authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as </span><span>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries, </span><span>genocidal warfare.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, </span><span>consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of </span><span>countries in Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those </span><span>markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated </span><span>with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and </span><span>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended </span><span>altogether.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market volatility may also be heightened by the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in </span><span>Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need </span><span>to effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will </span><span>not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund </span><span>effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in </span><span>securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental </span><span>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign </span><span>investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an </span><span>issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries </span><span>and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay </span><span>investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is </span><span>pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to </span><span>invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier </span><span>than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a </span><span>decline in the value of a Fund's investments. Issuers located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the </span><span>same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less </span><span>financial and other information publicly available with regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such </span><span>issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers </span><span>located or operating in more developed countries.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>94</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, governments of certain countries in Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on </span><span>income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes </span><span>are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in </span><span>such countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater degree of risk associated with governmental approval in </span><span>connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In </span><span>addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s balance of payments declines, such African country may impose </span><span>temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a </span><span>refusal to grant, required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any </span><span>restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, </span><span>seek local government approvals or take other actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and </span><span>unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. </span><span>Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be </span><span>no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of </span><span>corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to </span><span>which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such </span><span>countries may not receive many of the protections available to shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries. </span><span>Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable </span><span>enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in </span><span>Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </span><span>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </span><span>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </span><span>and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries </span><span>in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. </span><span>These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In </span><span>addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </span><span>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </span><span>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </span><span>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </span><span>indirectly subject to those risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector </span><span>and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic </span><span>conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of </span><span>diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may </span><span>be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political instability and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused and may in the future cause significant </span><span>disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries </span><span>in those countries and adversely impacted the region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has </span><span>further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly </span><span>through the region, and that developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some </span><span>protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a </span><span>risk to investments in the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and </span><span>terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>95</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span><span>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </span><span>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia </span><span>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and </span><span>flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are </span><span>dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in </span><span>other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies of </span><span>Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign </span><span>ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade </span><span>foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of certain Central and South American countries have </span><span>experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high </span><span>unemployment rates and political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities </span><span>(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of the region's exports and many economies in this region </span><span>are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant </span><span>adverse effect on other countries of this region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The governments of certain countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of </span><span>the private sector and may own or control many companies.

Some </span><span>countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have </span><span>been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative </span><span>currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These </span><span>countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they </span><span>trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which the Fund invests may be the </span><span>subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and </span><span>the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. </span><span>government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An </span><span>issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. The Fund may </span><span>be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </span><span> </span><span>Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of issuers domiciled in emerging </span><span>market countries. Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed </span><span>countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to </span><span>smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) companies, </span><span>custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local </span><span>authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local </span><span>governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments </span><span>may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local </span><span>taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by local </span><span>governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there may </span><span>be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the </span><span>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </span><span>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </span><span>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </span><span>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not </span><span>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>97</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </span><span>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </span><span>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </span><span>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </span><span>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </span><span>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </span><span>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </span><span>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </span><span>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </span><span>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the </span><span>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </span><span>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in </span><span>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </span><span>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </span><span>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </span><span>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </span><span>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </span><span>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </span><span>“</span><span>sovereign</span><span>”</span><span> assets. Certain emerging market </span><span>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </span><span>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </span><span>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the </span><span>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit </span><span>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of </span><span>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </span><span>by nationals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </span><span>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </span><span>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </span><span>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </span><span>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </span><span>imposition of trade barriers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of </span><span>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </span><span>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there </span><span>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </span><span>difficult to conduct such transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </span><span>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </span><span>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </span><span>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </span><span>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these </span><span>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </span><span>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary </span><span>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </span><span>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of </span><span>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>98</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </span><span>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </span><span>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </span><span>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </span><span>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the EU. A number of </span><span>countries within the EU are also members of the EMU (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) and have adopted the euro as their currency. </span><span>Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt </span><span>levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or </span><span>export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other </span><span>currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its </span><span>sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the </span><span>economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries are not in the </span><span>eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </span><span>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit </span><span>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </span><span>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected </span><span>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </span><span>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European </span><span>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further </span><span>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </span><span>euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The United Kingdom (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or </span><span>worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </span><span>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </span><span>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may </span><span>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </span><span>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact </span><span>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect </span><span>the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>99</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. </span><span> </span><span>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political </span><span>and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly </span><span>reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and </span><span>their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign currency values. As </span><span>global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many </span><span>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, </span><span>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a </span><span>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, </span><span>as well as the value of securities in a Fund's portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of </span><span>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </span><span>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in </span><span>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential </span><span>liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the </span><span>shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund </span><span>therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount </span><span>greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more </span><span>limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal </span><span>judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on </span><span>investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain </span><span>countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by </span><span>foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a </span><span>specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer </span><span>available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on </span><span>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a </span><span>Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased </span><span>re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result </span><span>in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be </span><span>made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is </span><span>subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors </span><span>has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment </span><span>income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental </span><span>approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </span><span>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </span><span>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </span><span>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </span><span>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </span><span>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </span><span>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </span><span>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </span><span>indirectly subject to those risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies </span><span>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as </span><span>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>100</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </span><span>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may </span><span>escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign </span><span>intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in North America. </span><span> </span><span>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </span><span>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </span><span>all of the North American countries in which a Fund invests. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade </span><span>Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has </span><span>increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of </span><span>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could </span><span>negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and </span><span>legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value </span><span>of certain securities held by a Fund. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Russia. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special </span><span>considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly </span><span>speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private </span><span>property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result of </span><span>expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, </span><span>restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and potentially greater price </span><span>volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no </span><span>assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be expropriated, nationalized or otherwise </span><span>confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a </span><span>Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the </span><span>Russian court system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic, political and social instability than is the case in other developed </span><span>countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military </span><span>involvement in political and economic decision-making, including changes in government through extra-constitutional </span><span>means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal </span><span>insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations, including armed conflict, with neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic, religious and racial </span><span>disaffection.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, </span><span>forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly </span><span>vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or </span><span>internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia </span><span>produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of </span><span>Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, </span><span>results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the </span><span>Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </span><span>many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which </span><span>could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could </span><span>adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its </span><span>regional geopolitical influence (including military steps) and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. </span><span>Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign </span><span>governments. Such steps have increased tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may </span><span>negatively affect economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For </span><span>example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>101</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russia Sanctions</span><span>. Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Sanctioning Bodies</span><span>”</span><span>) have imposed </span><span>economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking entities, </span><span>including banning Russia from global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies, or </span><span>others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result </span><span>in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the </span><span>Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in </span><span>prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Recently, Russia </span><span>has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>dividends), and prohibits Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </span><span>“</span><span>unfriendly states</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>as well as the export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity </span><span>of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions has and may continue to impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, </span><span>hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a </span><span>Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>affected securities</span><span>”</span><span>), or if deemed </span><span>appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions </span><span>and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund’s transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required </span><span>to freeze assets in a blocked account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, which has impaired the value and liquidity </span><span>of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. Due to such </span><span>a freeze of these assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy </span><span>any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially </span><span>lower prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures, which may further impair the value and </span><span>liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of the Fund to receive dividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number </span><span>of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, dividends), and </span><span>prohibits Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </span><span>“</span><span>unfriendly states</span><span>”</span><span> as well as the </span><span>export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russian companies may be unable to </span><span>pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund may be unable to receive them.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident </span><span>investors from executing security sales, and other events have led to changes in the Fund's Underlying Index. The Fund’s </span><span>Index Provider has removed Russian securities from the Underlying Index. To the extent that the Fund rebalances its portfolio </span><span>and trades in non-Russian securities to seek to track the investment results of the Underlying Index, this may result in </span><span>transaction costs and increased tracking error. The Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including </span><span>those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. This disparity will also lead to increased </span><span>tracking error. The inability of the Fund to trade in Russian securities may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to meet its </span><span>investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will </span><span>resume.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Also, if an affected security is included in a Fund’s Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its </span><span>holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>102</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a </span><span>Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may </span><span>not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error </span><span>between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. </span><span> </span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Funds) to invest in the securities of Saudi </span><span>Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and </span><span>unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market </span><span>Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>CMA</span><span>”</span><span>) places investment limitations on the ownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign </span><span>investors, including a limitation on a Fund’s ownership of the securities of any single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock </span><span>Exchange, which may prevent a Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. These restrictions may be changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special </span><span>approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such </span><span>licenses or approvals and may not be able to buy and sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes </span><span>could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could negatively impact a Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, </span><span>compared to more developed markets, given the limited history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. </span><span>Investments in Saudi Arabia may also be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the </span><span>imposition of restrictions on additional foreign investments and repatriation of capital. Such heightened risks may include, </span><span>among others, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, </span><span>including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as </span><span>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, </span><span>certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored </span><span>competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due </span><span>to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and </span><span>legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries </span><span>involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the </span><span>market for petroleum, as well as acts targeting petroleum production or processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As global </span><span>demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted. In the recent past, the Saudi Arabian </span><span>government has explored privatization and diversification of the economy in the wake of a diminished petroleum market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of </span><span>the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: </span><span>restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is </span><span>exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced </span><span>strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. </span><span>Incidents involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause uncertainty in their </span><span>markets and may adversely affect its economy and a Fund’s investments.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which could affect </span><span>private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on </span><span>Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the </span><span>value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi </span><span>Arabian economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or funds investing </span><span>in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition, </span><span>Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have </span><span>an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in </span><span>Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, </span><span>illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control </span><span>and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than </span><span>those of companies on exchanges in more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of </span><span>these securities and a Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>103</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, </span><span>and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East region </span><span>could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government </span><span>interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or </span><span>other factors. Additionally, anti-Western views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies </span><span>regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries </span><span>may affect these attitudes and policies. The U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a </span><span>result, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. </span><span>imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </span><span>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result, </span><span>securities to which a Fund has exposure. Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused </span><span>significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value </span><span>of securities in a Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or </span><span>embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as </span><span>state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which </span><span>operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those </span><span>risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the </span><span>automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may </span><span>be, at times, excess capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. </span><span>automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. </span><span>government, while others formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. </span><span>In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased </span><span>pension liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by </span><span>commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. </span><span>Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be </span><span>caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, </span><span>and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building </span><span>or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for </span><span>environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in </span><span>technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and </span><span>environmental policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in </span><span>the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend </span><span>heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic </span><span>expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, </span><span>worsening business cash flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, </span><span>corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in </span><span>interest rates, corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such </span><span>companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily </span><span>on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail </span><span>companies, and housing-related companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, </span><span>including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer </span><span>tastes and trends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor </span><span>relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government </span><span>regulation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>104</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved </span><span>in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office </span><span>products, clothing and textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the </span><span>domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer </span><span>disposable income. The consumer goods industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors </span><span>affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various food additives may affect the profitability </span><span>of certain companies in the consumer goods industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage </span><span>companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may </span><span>be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and </span><span>consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact </span><span>on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain </span><span>retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of </span><span>the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The </span><span>consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the </span><span>consumer services industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their </span><span>profitability. Companies in the consumer services industry are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may </span><span>be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the </span><span>success of consumer service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Electric Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The electric utility industry consists of companies that are engaged </span><span>principally in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy, although many also provide other energy-related </span><span>services. In the past, electric utility companies, in general, have been favorably affected by lower fuel and financing costs and </span><span>the full or near completion of major construction programs. In addition, many of these companies have generated cash flows </span><span>in excess of current operating expenses and construction expenditures, permitting some degree of diversification into </span><span>unregulated businesses. Some electric utilities have also taken advantage of the right to sell power outside of their traditional </span><span>geographic areas. Electric utility companies have historically been subject to the risks associated with increases in fuel and </span><span>other operating costs, high interest costs on borrowings needed for capital construction programs, costs associated with </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>105</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>compliance with environmental and safety regulations and changes in the regulatory climate. As interest rates declined, </span><span>many utilities refinanced high cost debt and in doing so improved their fixed charges coverage. Regulators, however, lowered </span><span>allowed rates of return as interest rates declined and thereby caused the benefits of the rate declines to be shared wholly or </span><span>in part with customers. In a period of rising interest rates, the allowed rates of return may not keep pace with the utilities’ </span><span>increased costs. The construction and operation of nuclear power facilities are subject to strict scrutiny by, and evolving </span><span>regulations of, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state agencies which have comparable jurisdiction. Strict scrutiny </span><span>might result in higher operating costs and higher capital expenditures, with the risk that the regulators may disallow </span><span>inclusion of these costs in rate authorizations or the risk that a company may not be permitted to operate or complete </span><span>construction of a facility. In addition, operators of nuclear power plants may be subject to significant costs for disposal of </span><span>nuclear fuel and for decommissioning such plants.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The rating agencies look closely at the business profile of utility companies. Ratings for companies are expected to be </span><span>impacted to a greater extent in the future by the division of their asset base. Electric utility companies that focus more on the </span><span>generation of electricity may be assigned less favorable ratings as this business is expected to be competitive and the least </span><span>regulated. On the other hand, companies that focus on transmission and distribution, which is expected to be the least </span><span>competitive and the more regulated part of the business, may see higher ratings given the greater predictability of cash flow.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A number of states are considering or have enacted deregulation proposals. The introduction of competition into the </span><span>industry as a result of such deregulation has at times resulted in lower revenue, lower credit ratings, increased default risk, </span><span>and lower electric utility security prices. Such increased competition may also cause long-term contracts, which electric </span><span>utilities previously entered into to buy power, to become </span><span>“</span><span>stranded assets</span><span>”</span><span> which have no economic value. Any loss </span><span>associated with such contracts must be absorbed by ratepayers and investors. In addition, some electric utilities have </span><span>acquired electric utilities overseas to diversify, enhance earnings and gain experience in operating in a deregulated </span><span>environment. In some instances, such acquisitions have involved significant borrowings, which have burdened the acquirer’s </span><span>balance sheet. There is no assurance that current deregulation proposals will be adopted. However, deregulation in any form </span><span>could significantly impact the electric utilities industry.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of </span><span>global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation </span><span>efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These </span><span>companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt </span><span>and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global </span><span>economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its </span><span>investment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate </span><span>significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, </span><span>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and </span><span>between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade </span><span>sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices </span><span>have recently been subject to increased volatility, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For </span><span>example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on </span><span>the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility </span><span>occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of certain crude oil </span><span>futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by terrorism, war, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other </span><span>catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may </span><span>significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries </span><span>where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. </span><span>Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently </span><span>experienced widespread social unrest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic </span><span>conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and </span><span>property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, </span><span>violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively </span><span>small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget </span><span>constraints may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly </span><span>regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their </span><span>operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter </span><span>laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and </span><span>may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector. Energy companies may have </span><span>relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than companies in other sectors to restructure their businesses during </span><span>economic downturns or adversity in global energy markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the </span><span>energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain </span><span>commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. and certain European countries have announced bans or restrictions on </span><span>imports of hydrocarbon commodities from Russia. The effect of such bans and any similar restrictions by other countries, as </span><span>well as the extent, scope and duration of the conflict, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy </span><span>sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments </span><span>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </span><span>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </span><span>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general </span><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </span><span>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </span><span>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </span><span>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </span><span>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>107</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </span><span>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely </span><span>affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, </span><span>product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>108</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of </span><span>factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital </span><span>construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, </span><span>the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, </span><span>the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely </span><span>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological </span><span>developments, and labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure </span><span>projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly </span><span>affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and </span><span>other government demand for their products.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be adversely affected by government regulation or world events in </span><span>the regions where the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the </span><span>imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor </span><span>unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging </span><span>market countries, which may heighten these risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operations Risk. </span><span>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately </span><span>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic </span><span>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Customer Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers </span><span>fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and </span><span>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </span><span>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Strategic Asset Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, major pipelines or highways), </span><span>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or </span><span>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors </span><span>and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk. </span><span>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally </span><span>associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in </span><span>periods of rising interest rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Inflation Risk. </span><span>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline </span><span>in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of its assets may be </span><span>linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the </span><span>rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transportation Risk. </span><span>The stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and </span><span>demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the </span><span>performance of companies in the transportation industry group.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Oil and Gas Risk.</span><span> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production </span><span>spending.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilities Risk. </span><span>Utilities companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse </span><span>effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by </span><span>governmental regulatory commissions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>109</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Insurance Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some </span><span>countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing </span><span>competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments </span><span>of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up </span><span>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Media Sub-Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the media sub-industry may encounter distressed cash flows </span><span>due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in formulating new products and </span><span>services using new technology. Media companies are subject to risks that include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a </span><span>potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, competition </span><span>in the industry and the potential for increased state and federal regulation. Advertising spending is an important source of </span><span>revenue for media companies. During economic downturns, advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media </span><span>companies tend to generate less revenue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Municipal Securities in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, </span><span>including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. </span><span>Various future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing </span><span>requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of </span><span>environmental and other governmental regulations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular utility project </span><span>often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments </span><span>affecting a particular utility project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Certain utilities are </span><span>subject to specific risks. Gas utilities are subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from other providers </span><span>of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility </span><span>enters into long-term contracts for the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly </span><span>and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and </span><span>volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production </span><span>and conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience </span><span>a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be </span><span>available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long </span><span>periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC </span><span>members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or </span><span>cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. </span><span>Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact companies in this industry. For </span><span>instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise </span><span>significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In addition, the Middle East, where many </span><span>companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas </span><span>companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant portion of their revenues </span><span>may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on the </span><span>production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the </span><span>crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front month WTI crude oil futures </span><span>contracts falling below zero for a period of time. Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to </span><span>further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential </span><span>disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the United </span><span>States announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect of the U.S. ban and any similar </span><span>bans by other countries, as well as the extent and duration of the Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated </span><span>market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these </span><span>events or any related developments could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>110</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </span><span>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>111</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in </span><span>senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior claims </span><span>to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary </span><span>considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </span><span>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise </span><span>provided to you.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Retail Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international </span><span>economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. </span><span>Companies in the retail industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The </span><span>success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social trends, marketing campaigns and public </span><span>perceptions. Companies in the retail industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many </span><span>of these companies are dependent on third party suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to </span><span>protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>112</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often </span><span>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </span><span>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </span><span>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience </span><span>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </span><span>of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </span><span>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Transportation Infrastructure Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Municipal securities include, among others, bonds payable </span><span>from fuel taxes and tolls for municipal toll roads, as well as general airport bonds. Issuers in the transportation infrastructure </span><span>industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange </span><span>rates, industry competition, insurance costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and </span><span>airports. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project often depend on revenues from </span><span>that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can </span><span>result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation </span><span>infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or </span><span>other government decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy (the </span><span>“</span><span>iShares ETFs</span><span> </span><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span>”</span><span>), and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Proxy </span><span>Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>113</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one </span><span>hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that </span><span>are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the </span><span>issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </span><span>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </span><span>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident </span><span>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </span><span>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further </span><span>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Information with respect to how proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period </span><span>ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' </span><span>website at www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On each Business Day (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI), prior to the opening </span><span>of regular trading on the Fund’s primary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on its website (</span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>) certain </span><span>information relating to the portfolio holdings that will form the basis of a Fund’s next net asset value per share calculation or </span><span>calculations (in the case of each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, the </span><span>information will relate to each net asset value per share calculation or calculations).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain information may also be made available to certain parties:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Communications of Data Files: </span><span>A Fund may make available through the facilities of the National Securities Clearing </span><span>Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>NSCC</span><span>”</span><span>) or through posting on the </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>, prior to the opening of trading on each business </span><span>day, a list of a Fund’s holdings (generally pro-rata) that Authorized Participants could deliver to a Fund to settle </span><span>purchases of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Deposit Securities) or that Authorized Participants would receive from a Fund to settle </span><span>redemptions of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Fund Securities).

Component securities include U.S. Treasury </span><span>bonds with at least seven years to final maturity; mortgage-backed pass-through securities (MBS) and investment-grade and </span><span>high yield U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds, each with at least one year to final maturity; and commercial mortgage-backed </span><span>securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (</span><span>“</span><span>ABS</span><span>”</span><span>) of any maturity. The Underlying Index includes bonds registered with </span><span>the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of issuance or offered pursuant to Rule 144A with or without registration </span><span>rights.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Methodology. </span><span>The Underlying Index determines constituents and their weights based on a proprietary factor model </span><span>that systematically applies (1) macroeconomic factor timing, (2) macroeconomic factor tilt, and (3) style factors. The first </span><span>step of the factor model is macroeconomic factor timing, which considers high yield bond prices and the price momentum </span><span>of high yield securities to determine the status of the economy (as reflected in the bond market) at a given point in time (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., </span><span>whether default risk is low, average and declining, average and increasing, or high). The status of the macroeconomic regime </span><span>at rebalance is used to determine several features of the Underlying Index composition, including the duration and duration-times-spread</span><span> (</span><span>“</span><span>DxS,</span><span>”</span><span> which measures credit volatility) targets, as well as determining high yield and MBS sector allocations. </span><span>The ABS and CMBS weights are then set in line with the weights in the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The second step of the factor model is macroeconomic factor tilt, which assigns the Underlying Index's allocation to </span><span>predetermined maturity bands of the yield curve, specifically (1) long-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds and (2) short- and </span><span>intermediate-maturity investment grade corporate bonds in seeking to maximize total return per unit of risk (defined as </span><span>duration for U.S. Treasuries and DxS for corporate bonds). The Underlying Index constituents are the result of an asset </span><span>allocation optimization process that seeks maximum carry, the return generated from an investment in a higher yielding </span><span>security over a lower yielding security, assuming prices remain constant, subject to the Underlying Index's duration and DxS </span><span>targets.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The last step of the model is to select securities based on style factor attributes: quality and value. The quality factor seeks to </span><span>reduce relative exposure to securities with the highest default risk, and the value factor seeks to increase the relative weight </span><span>of bonds with lower market prices compared to other bonds with similar fundamental characteristics. The Underlying Index </span><span>is rebalanced monthly.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Component Selection Criteria. </span><span>Eligible bonds are chosen by applying the eligibility rules and optimization methodology listed </span><span>above.

The Underlying Index is </span><span>a modified market-value weighted index with a cap on each issuer at 3%. There is no maximum number of bond issues per </span><span>issuer eligible, but to avoid an over-concentration in any single-issuer, the methodology caps single-issuer exposure to no </span><span>more than 3% of the index weight.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria above are </span><span>applied at month-end. Bonds that were in the Underlying Index, but that no longer satisfy all the criteria at month-end, will </span><span>be removed from the Underlying Index. A bond that drops out of the Underlying Index at the rebalancing day is excluded </span><span>from reentering the index for a three-month period. The rule for the lockout period takes precedence over the other rules for </span><span>the Underlying Index selection. A locked out bond will not be selected, even if it qualifies for the index. If a bond becomes </span><span>eligible in the middle of the month, it will still need to satisfy the criteria at the end of the month, and can be included only </span><span>upon rebalancing at month-end. Any bond that enters the Underlying Index must remain in the Underlying Index for a </span><span>minimum of six months provided it is not downgraded to sub-investment grade, defaulted or fully redeemed in that period. </span><span>Existing bonds in the Underlying Index that receive a rating upgrade can remain in the index if the six-month minimum has </span><span>not been satisfied. When a bond is called, it remains in the Underlying Index at its call price until the end of the month, after </span><span>which it is removed. Changes in issue size that take place during the month are taken into consideration only at the next </span><span>rebalancing date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Markit iBoxx</span><span>®</span><span> USD Liquid High Yield Index</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 1,175</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Description.</span><span> The Markit iBoxx</span><span>®</span><span> USD Liquid High Yield Index measures the performance of the liquid high yield </span><span>corporate bond market.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Description.</span><span> The Markit iBoxx</span><span>®</span><span> USD Liquid Investment Grade Index measures the performance as of February 28, </span><span>2023, of approximately 2,570 highly liquid investment-grade corporate bonds. The Underlying Index is a rules-based index </span><span>consisting of highly liquid, investment-grade, U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds that seeks to maximize liquidity while </span><span>maintaining representation of the broader corporate bond market.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Index Methodology. </span><span>The Underlying Index is a subset of the Markit iBoxx USD Corporate Bond Index, which as of February </span><span>28, 2023 is an index of 7,573 investment-grade bonds. Bonds in the Underlying Index are selected from the universe of </span><span>eligible bonds in the Markit iBoxx USD Corporate Bond Index using defined rules. Currently, the bonds eligible for inclusion in </span><span>the Underlying Index consist of U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds that: (i) are issued by companies domiciled in the </span><span>countries classified as developed markets by the index provider; (ii) have an average rating of investment grade (ratings from </span><span>Fitch, Moody’s, or S&amp;P Global Ratings are considered; if more than one agency provides a rating, the average rating is </span><span>attached to the bond); (iii) are from issuers with at least $2 billion outstanding face value; (iv) have at least $750 million of </span><span>outstanding face value; (v) have at least three years to maturity; and (vi) have at least three years and 6 months to maturity </span><span>for new index insertions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Component Selection Criteria.</span><span> Eligible bonds are chosen by applying the eligibility rules listed above. The Underlying Index is </span><span>a modified market value weighted index with a cap on each issuer at 3%. The number of bonds in the Underlying Index may </span><span>change and there is no constraint on the number of index constituents. There is no maximum number of bond issues per </span><span>issuer eligible, but to avoid an over-concentration in any single-issuer, the methodology caps single-issuer exposure to no </span><span>more than 3% of the index weight, calculated on the last business day of each month. The Underlying Index is updated </span><span>monthly on the last business day of each month.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The composition of the Underlying Index is held constant for any given calendar month to ensure continuity during the </span><span>month and to avoid jumps unrelated to the price movements of the bonds. The inclusion and exclusion criteria above are </span><span>applied at month-end, after the close of business. Bonds that were in the Underlying Index, but that no longer satisfy all the </span><span>criteria at month-end, will be removed from the Underlying Index. If a bond becomes eligible in the middle of the month, it </span><span>will still need to satisfy the criteria at the end of the month, and can be included only upon rebalancing at month-end. When </span><span>a bond is called, it remains in the Underlying Index at its call price until the end of the month, after which it is removed. </span><span>Changes in issue size that take place during the month are taken into consideration only at the next rebalancing date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Markit</span><span>®</span><span> and iBoxx</span><span>®</span><span> are registered trademarks of Markit Group Limited and Markit Indices Limited, respectively.

A vote of a majority </span><span>of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting </span><span>securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund </span><span>are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund has </span><span>also adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental investment </span><span>policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Therefore, each Fund may change its investment </span><span>objective and its Underlying Index without shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, </span><span>iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF will not:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span></div> <div><span>Concentrate its investments (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, invest 25% or more of its total assets in the securities of a particular industry or group </span><span>of industries), except that a Fund will concentrate to approximately the same extent that its Underlying Index </span><span>concentrates in the securities of such particular industry or group of industries.

The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, </span><span>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </span><span>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give </span><span>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</span><span> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>137</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </span><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </span><span>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </span><span>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward </span><span>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </span><span>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares BBB Rated Corporate </span><span>Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares </span><span>ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, iShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S. </span><span>Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF, iShares </span><span>Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF</span><span> and</span><span> iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to </span><span>the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All funds other than the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares BBB </span><span>Rated Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Investment Grade Corporate </span><span>Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, iShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF, </span><span>iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares High Yield Systematic </span><span>Bond ETF, iShares Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF</span><span> and</span><span> iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the investment restrictions adopted as fundamental policies, set forth above, each Fund has adopted a </span><span>non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or </span><span>control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, which </span><span>currently limits each Fund’s holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund’s net assets.

If, </span><span>subsequent to an investment, an 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner </span><span>that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </span><span>extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end </span><span>investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </span><span>“</span><span>fund of funds</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment </span><span>company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply </span><span>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </span><span>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not </span><span>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </span><span>without undue market or tax consequences.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>139</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </span><span>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Trustees and Officers. </span><span> </span><span>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </span><span>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </span><span>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and </span><span>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</span><span>“</span><span>Independent Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock-advised Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) are organized into one </span><span>complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fixed-Income</span><span> Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) and one complex of ETFs (</span><span>“</span><span>Exchange-Traded Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>). Each </span><span>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee </span><span>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists </span><span>of 387 funds as of June 30, 2023. With the exception of Stephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron Wasserman, the address </span><span>of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito and </span><span>Mr. Wasserman is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o BlackRock, </span><span>Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United Kingdom. The Board has designated John E. </span><span>Kerrigan as its Independent Board Chair.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>146</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </span><span>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</span><span>  </span><span>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. </span><span>Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee.

(collectively </span><span>referred to in this section as </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </span><span>and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>167</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>168</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>169</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </span><span>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for </span><span>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </span><span>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by </span><span>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>170</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>171</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>172</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>the Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>173</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have retained BlackRock Investments, LLC, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform </span><span>certain order processing, Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received </span><span>from Authorized Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services </span><span>provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and </span><span>development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with </span><span>BlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </span><span>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </span><span>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that </span><span>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </span><span>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>174</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The custody arrangement described in </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span><span> may lead to potential </span><span>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses </span><span>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </span><span>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </span><span>balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </span><span>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </span><span>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions </span><span>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </span><span>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or </span><span>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </span><span>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </span><span>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </span><span>Distribution Services</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Adviser. </span><span> </span><span>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between </span><span>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA.

Under the investment advisory </span><span>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </span><span>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets.

In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </span><span>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Compensation may include a variety of </span><span>components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation </span><span>include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more </span><span>of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>181</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other </span><span>benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive </span><span>compensation, determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of </span><span>the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the </span><span>team relative to the portfolios’ investment objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its </span><span>Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and </span><span>BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion </span><span>represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be </span><span>granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term </span><span>shareholders and motivate performance.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The discretionary incentive income for James Mauro, Scott Radell, Karen Uyehara and Jeff Rosenberg includes as an additional </span><span>consideration the performance of actively-managed portfolios they manage over 1, 3 and 5 year periods measured against </span><span>the respective benchmark of each portfolio as well as peer group performance. A portion of the discretionary incentive </span><span>compensation for James Mauro, Scott Radell, Karen Uyehara and Jeff Rosenberg is distributed in the form of deferred cash </span><span>awards that notionally track the returns of select BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which provides direct </span><span>alignment of portfolio manager discretionary incentive compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards </span><span>vest ratably over a number of years and, once vested, settle in the form of cash.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of February 28, 2023, the Portfolio Managers beneficially owned shares of the Funds in the amounts reflected in the </span><span>following tables:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and </span><span>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </span><span>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by </span><span>investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </span><span>BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including </span><span>the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, </span><span>educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (</span><span>“</span><span>Education </span><span>Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials </span><span>relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (</span><span>“</span><span>Publishing Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). In addition, BFA Entities make </span><span>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </span><span>their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature </span><span>iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an </span><span>Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities </span><span>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </span><span>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as </span><span>revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>198</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span><span>Management, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan </span><span>Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public </span><span>Holdings, Inc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC, Stash investments, LLC, </span><span>TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial </span><span>Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have </span><span>occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive.

The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury </span><span>Bond ETF) is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on </span><span>each business day the NYSE is open. The NAV of each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short </span><span>Treasury Bond ETF is generally calculated twice per day: as of 12:00 p.m., Eastern time and as of the close of regular trading </span><span>hours on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time), on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by a </span><span>Fund is as follows:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fixed-Income Investments. </span><span>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued </span><span>using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available bid prices </span><span>or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved </span><span>independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data </span><span>(</span><span>e.g</span><span>., recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other </span><span>relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable </span><span>quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and </span><span>assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round </span><span>lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than </span><span>institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days </span><span>or less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including </span><span>asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash </span><span>flows of each tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the </span><span>benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>200</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>201</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, follow the requirements </span><span>for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value </span><span>Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US </span><span>GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span><span>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </span><span>other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>202</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>203</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The table below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </span><span>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</span><span> </span><span>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </span><span>over those periods</span><span> </span><span>or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </span><span>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>DTCC</span><span>”</span><span>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </span><span>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </span><span>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants.

Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span><span>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </span><span>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any </span><span>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </span><span>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </span><span>cost.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </span><span>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors.

Any portion of a </span><span>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Fed or DTC must be delivered through a Central Depository Account. </span><span>The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the </span><span>delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m., </span><span>Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Fed must be deposited by the participant </span><span>institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash </span><span>through the Fed to the account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.

The </span><span>“</span><span>Settlement Date</span><span>”</span><span> for all funds is generally the second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to </span><span>the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the </span><span>deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The </span><span>amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank </span><span>wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the </span><span>Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the </span><span>Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be </span><span>resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the </span><span>Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the second Business Day following the day </span><span>on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been </span><span>received by the Funds prior to such time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares </span><span>Short Treasury Bond ETF), in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s </span><span>NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are sold or </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units at a price based on the Fund’s NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order </span><span>tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or its agent in proper form. Generally, an order will be implemented as of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>215</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA </span><span>and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. </span><span>Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for </span><span>Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for </span><span>making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will </span><span>provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an </span><span>Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span><span>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of </span><span>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash </span><span>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </span><span>of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF) generally before 4:00 </span><span>p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and </span><span>iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are sold or redeemed only in Creation Units at a price based on the Fund’s </span><span>NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or its agent in proper </span><span>form. Generally, an order will be implemented as of the next determined NAV, as described in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Creation Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the </span><span>Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market </span><span>disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its </span><span>agent or an Authorized Participant. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to </span><span>as that Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and </span><span>requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open </span><span>for business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for </span><span>this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next </span><span>determined after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </span><span>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </span><span>as set forth below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </span><span>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>216</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </span><span>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them </span><span>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are </span><span>generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date) (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond </span><span>ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF). For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond </span><span>ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+1 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, one Business Day after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right </span><span>to settle Creation Unit transactions on a different basis, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate </span><span>under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units </span><span>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </span><span>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </span><span>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </span><span>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance </span><span>of Creation Units. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform the ETF </span><span>Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each creation order, which consists of </span><span>(1) a fee for providing the ETF Services (the </span><span>“</span><span>ETF Servicing Fee</span><span>”</span><span>) and (2) transfer, processing and other transaction costs </span><span>charged by a Fund custodian in connection with the issuance of Creation Units for such creation order (</span><span>“</span><span>Custody Transaction </span><span>Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any </span><span>Custody Transaction Costs to the applicable Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, which amount will </span><span>vary among different Funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of securities or </span><span>instruments included in a Fund’s Creation Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per </span><span>order based on the number of trades, underlying markets and settlement locations associated with the issuance of a Creation </span><span>Unit. The following table sets forth, for each Fund, an estimate of the creation transaction fee for a Creation Unit based on </span><span>data as of November 13, 2023 and December 1, 2023, respectively. The actual fee charged to an Authorized Participant in </span><span>connection with a creation order will vary over time depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than the </span><span>fee set forth below. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the </span><span>maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and </span><span>expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a </span><span>good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>217</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Please see the </span><span>Cash </span><span>Redemption Method</span><span> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on </span><span>redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be </span><span>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</span><span>“</span><span>Fund </span><span>Securities</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Redemption Basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and an amount of cash (the </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> as described below) in order to effect </span><span>redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until such time as the </span><span>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </span><span>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to </span><span>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </span><span>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </span><span>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being </span><span>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </span><span>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. </span><span>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund </span><span>Security of the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security. In such cases, a transaction </span><span>fee may be charged on the cash amount paid in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass through security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities (except for the Partial Cash Funds, which generally redeem Creation Units </span><span>partially for cash), and the iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond </span><span>ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF which may substitute all or a substantial portion of the Fund Securities </span><span>for cash, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole </span><span>discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of </span><span>the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified to minimize the Cash </span><span>Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through systematically </span><span>rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded up,</span><span>”</span><span> while </span><span>limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Redemption </span><span>Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions </span><span>that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cash Redemption Method.</span><span>  </span><span> Although the Trust does not generally permit full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its </span><span>funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> Creation Units of the Partial </span><span>Cash Funds are generally redeemed partially for cash and the iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond </span><span>ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF which may substitute cash for all or a </span><span>substantial portion of the Fund Securities for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind </span><span>redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of </span><span>the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash </span><span>Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>219</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </span><span>relevant Fund. As described above, under an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to </span><span>perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each redemption </span><span>order, which consists of (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody Transaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF </span><span>Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody. Transaction Costs to the </span><span>applicable Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, which amount will </span><span>vary among different Funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of securities or </span><span>instruments included in a Fund’s Redemption Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per </span><span>order based on the number of trades, underlying markets, and settlement locations associated with the redemption of a </span><span>Creation Unit. The following table sets forth, for each Fund, an estimate of the redemption transaction fee for a Creation Unit </span><span>based on data as of November 13, 2023 and December 1, 2023, respectively. The actual fee charged to an Authorized </span><span>Participant in connection with a redemption order will vary over time depending on the factors discussed above, and may be </span><span>higher than the fee set forth below. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be </span><span>required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price </span><span>movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in </span><span>certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of </span><span>transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption </span><span>transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial </span><span>intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's estimated redemption transaction based on data as of November 13, 2023 and </span><span>December 1, 2023, respectively, and maximum additional charge (as described above):</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

For the iShares 0-3 </span><span>Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are redeemed only in creation units at a </span><span>price based on the Fund’s NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor </span><span>or its agent in proper form.

At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </span><span>by such Authorized Participant.

For example, the redemption settlement process may be extended because of the occurrence of a </span><span>holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date </span><span>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </span><span>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </span><span>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The </span><span>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </span><span>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </span><span>Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </span><span>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </span><span>for related brokerage and other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </span><span>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </span><span>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by </span><span>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under normal circumstances, each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF may </span><span>postpone and/or suspend redemption and payment beyond one business day only as follows: (i) for any period during which </span><span>there is a non-routine closure of the Fedwire or applicable Federal Reserve Banks; (ii) for any period during which the Listing </span><span>Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (iii) for any period during which trading on the </span><span>Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iv) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which </span><span>disposal of the shares of the Fund’s portfolio securities or determination of its net asset value is not reasonably practicable; </span><span>(v) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC; (vi) for any period during which the Fund, as part of a necessary </span><span>liquidation of the Fund, has properly postponed and/or suspended redemption of shares and payment in accordance with </span><span>federal securities laws; or (vii) on the Fund’s ex-dividend dates.

In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant.

Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>223</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and </span><span>non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for and to elect treatment as a </span><span>separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually </span><span>distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term </span><span>capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of </span><span>each Fund’s annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains </span><span>from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, </span><span>gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or </span><span>currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, partnerships that are traded </span><span>on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of </span><span>its income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </span><span>quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </span><span>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities </span><span>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </span><span>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </span><span>value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or </span><span>more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related </span><span>trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </span><span>partnerships.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although in general the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in </span><span>partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S.</span><span> income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the </span><span>dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its </span><span>capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that </span><span>doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>224</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and </span><span>profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than </span><span>two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the </span><span>excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to </span><span>such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following Funds had tax basis net capital loss carryforwards as set forth in the table below as of February 28, 2023, the </span><span>tax year-end for the Funds listed:</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

Long-term capital gains are eligible for </span><span>taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds </span><span>certain threshold amounts.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>226</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </span><span>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. The Fund's capital loss carryovers, if any, carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do </span><span>not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. Shareholders receiving </span><span>dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving </span><span>a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will </span><span>receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an </span><span>investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest </span><span>deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sales of Shares.</span><span>  </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>227</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a </span><span>family of mutual funds.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </span><span>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.</span><span>  </span><span>Dividends paid by the Municipal Bond Funds that are properly reported as exempt-interest </span><span>dividends will not be subject to regular federal income tax. Each Municipal Bond Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner </span><span>such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. Dividends paid </span><span>by the Fund will be exempt from federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the </span><span>extent of the Fund’s tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each </span><span>quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds that are excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes </span><span>and as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>So long as, at the close of each quarter of the taxable year of the California Fund, at least 50% of the value of the California </span><span>Fund’s total assets consists of obligations of the U.S. and of the State of California and its political subdivisions, the interest </span><span>on which is exempt from California personal income tax and California corporate income tax (</span><span>“</span><span>CA-exempt Obligations</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>exempt-interest dividends (i) paid by the California Fund in an amount not exceeding the interest received on such CA-exempt</span><span> Obligations during the California Fund’s taxable year, and (ii) reported by the California Fund as exempt-interest </span><span>dividends (in a written notice mailed to the California Fund’s shareholders) will be treated as an item of interest excludable </span><span>from income for California personal income tax purposes and corporate income tax purposes. Exempt-interest dividends </span><span>paid to a corporate shareholder subject to California corporate franchise tax, however, will be taxable as ordinary income for </span><span>purposes of such tax. Distributions derived from interest on tax-exempt obligations issued by governmental authorities in </span><span>states other than California or on other obligations or investments the interest on which is not exempt from California </span><span>personal income tax or corporate income tax, and distributions to shareholders derived from short-term or long-term capital </span><span>gains, will be taxed as ordinary income for California personal and corporate income tax purposes and California corporate </span><span>franchise tax purposes. Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a shareholder of the California Fund to purchase or </span><span>carry shares of the California Fund generally will not be deductible for California personal or corporate income tax purposes. </span><span>It should be noted that California law deviates from the provisions of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal </span><span>Revenue Code, relating to regulated investment companies in certain potentially material respects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The foregoing is a general, abbreviated summary of certain of the provisions of California law presently in effect that govern </span><span>the taxation of the shareholders of the California Fund. These provisions are subject to change by legislative or administrative </span><span>action, and any such change may be retroactive. Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisors for more </span><span>detailed information concerning California tax matters.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Individual shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will not be required to include in their gross income for New </span><span>York State and City purposes any portion of distributions received from the Fund that are directly attributable to (i) interest </span><span>earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State or any political subdivision thereof (including New York City) or </span><span>(ii) interest earned on obligations of U.S. possessions or territories that is exempt from state taxation pursuant to federal law, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>228</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Distributions from the Fund that are attributable to sources other than </span><span>those described in the preceding sentence (including interest on obligations of other states and their political subdivisions) </span><span>will generally be taxable to individual shareholders as ordinary income.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF that are subject to New York State corporation franchise tax or New </span><span>York City general corporation tax will be required to include exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund in their </span><span>“</span><span>entire net </span><span>income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of such taxes and will be required to include their shares of the Fund in their investment capital for </span><span>purposes of such taxes.

However, shareholders of the Fund will not be subject to the unincorporated business tax imposed by New York City </span><span>solely by reason of their ownership of shares in the Fund.

These provisions are subject to change by </span><span>legislative or administrative action, and any such change may be retroactive with respect to New York Municipal Income </span><span>transactions. Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisers for more detailed information concerning New </span><span>York State and City matters.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>section 1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and </span><span>any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its </span><span>fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by </span><span>the Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as </span><span>capital assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will </span><span>be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or </span><span>loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap </span><span>for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a swap transaction will be netted </span><span>pro rata</span><span> against </span><span>both tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently </span><span>recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>229</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Periodic net payments that would otherwise </span><span>constitute ordinary deductions but are allocable under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends will not be </span><span>allowed as deductions but instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Market Discount. </span><span> </span><span>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a </span><span>bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue </span><span>discount (</span><span>“</span><span>OID</span><span>”</span><span>). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s </span><span>disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued </span><span>market discount.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by certain of the Funds from investments in </span><span>non-U.S. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between </span><span>certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of a Fund’s total assets at </span><span>the close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect for U.S. income tax purposes </span><span>to treat non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, </span><span>but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to make an election, shareholders of the Fund would be required to </span><span>take into account an amount equal to their pro rata portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and </span><span>then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax deduction or as a foreign tax credit against </span><span>their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, a Fund will report to its </span><span>shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included in each shareholder’s gross income </span><span>and the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a </span><span>shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the extent to which the credit (but not </span><span>the deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the </span><span>time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time a </span><span>Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In </span><span>general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable </span><span>to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, </span><span>gain or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures </span><span>contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in </span><span>exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund </span><span>were to elect otherwise.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Original Issue Discount. </span><span> </span><span>OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder </span><span>of the bond. STRIPS are treated as newly issued debt instruments having OID. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to </span><span>inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method </span><span>of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted</span><span> principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the </span><span>period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable </span><span>year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until </span><span>the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The </span><span>amount of negative inflation adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, </span><span>reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s </span><span>income with respect to the bond for the taxable year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reporting.</span><span>  </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>230</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest </span><span>and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, </span><span>reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term capital </span><span>gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable </span><span>year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as </span><span>such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as </span><span>ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S. </span><span>shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </span><span>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </span><span>rules to their accounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The rules laid out in the previous paragraph, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund’s </span><span>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) </span><span>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </span><span>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </span><span>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will </span><span>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, </span><span>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence </span><span>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </span><span>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>231</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Other foreign entities will need to provide the </span><span>name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial </span><span>U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S. </span><span>estate tax.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as </span><span>a substitute for careful tax planning.

These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers </span><span>are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFMD Disclosure </span><span>Provisions</span><span>”</span><span>) if such managers market a fund to EU investors. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure </span><span>can be made.

For </span><span>these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be </span><span>the AIFM. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>232</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Given that the Funds do not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not </span><span>intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and </span><span>appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems </span><span>employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures </span><span>employed in respect of the Fund. </span></div> <div> <div><span>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors’ Rights. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, </span><span>administrator, custodian and transfer agent.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </span><span>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the </span><span>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders </span><span>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </span><span>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they </span><span>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </span><span>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws. </span><span>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </span><span>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of </span><span>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </span><span>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps achieve this balance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </span><span>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </span><span>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </span><span>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </span><span>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </span><span>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</span><span>1</span><span> We also contribute to </span><span>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </span><span>long-term shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and </span><span>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </span><span>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where </span><span>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </span><span>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </span><span>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </span><span>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </span><span>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </span><span>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </span><span>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </span><span>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </span><span>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </span><span>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </span><span>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </span><span>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </span><span>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </span><span>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </span><span>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more accessible for investors in separate accounts and </span><span>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in </span><span>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </span><span>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </span><span>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a company’s ability to </span><span>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </span><span>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the </span><span>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </span><span>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div> <div><span>These Principles cover seven key themes:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Our regional and market-specific </span><span>voting guidelines</span><span> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </span><span>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </span><span>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </span><span>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </span><span>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and </span><span>impactful responsibilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </span><span>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</span><span>2</span><span> as well as the </span><span>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </span><span>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </span><span>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </span><span>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </span><span>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </span><span>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </span><span>mitigated.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </span><span>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </span><span>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </span><span>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In </span><span>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Supporting and overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </span><span>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address anticipated or actual obstacles to success</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use, waste </span><span>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </span><span>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </span><span>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </span><span>component of a sound governance framework.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </span><span>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the company, </span><span>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </span><span>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and </span><span>regulations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular accountability</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</span><span> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </span><span>timely manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the </span><span>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </span><span>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </span><span>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the </span><span>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage </span><span>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </span><span>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a </span><span>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence </span><span>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </span><span>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and their shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </span><span>contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating new directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </span><span>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board composition. </span><span>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </span><span>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics </span><span>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </span><span>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and </span><span>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </span><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>4</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees </span><span>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </span><span>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, </span><span>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </span><span>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance </span><span>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </span><span>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </span><span>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee those functions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </span><span>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </span><span>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to </span><span>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately </span><span>managing risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle </span><span>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </span><span>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal </span><span>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </span><span>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while </span><span>minimizing costs to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </span><span>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </span><span>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </span><span>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </span><span>a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </span><span>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies </span><span>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </span><span>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </span><span>guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </span><span>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </span><span>market practice.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>outperformance against peer firms.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </span><span>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </span><span>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </span><span>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </span><span>or structures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </span><span>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related </span><span>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </span><span>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures are inadequate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </span><span>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </span><span>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>(IFRS) Foundation.</span><span>5</span><span> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk disclosure, the four pillars of </span><span>the TCFD governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets are a useful way for companies to disclose how </span><span>they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. SASB’s industry-specific </span><span>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs) </span><span>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </span><span>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality </span><span>of these issues for many businesses.</span><span>6</span><span> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </span><span>be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </span><span>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various </span><span>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </span><span>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </span><span>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and </span><span>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </span><span>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </span><span>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and </span><span>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </span><span>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help </span><span>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </span><span>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </span><span>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term </span><span>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </span><span>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>7</span><span> It is, of course, up to each company to define </span><span>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>8</span><span> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>9</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.

SASB standards will over time be adapted to ISSB standards but are the reference reporting tool in the meantime.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> <div><span>While guidance is still under development for a unified disclosure framework related to natural capital, the emerging recommendations of the </span><span>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), may prove useful to some companies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> <div><span>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </span><span>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us to do so, we </span><span>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> <div><span>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </span><span>transition as compared to the alternative.

We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </span><span>basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </span><span>risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent to </span><span>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </span><span>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business </span><span>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </span><span>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse </span><span>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </span><span>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </span><span>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </span><span>strategy and purpose.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </span><span>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </span><span>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate Form</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>10</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </span><span>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </span><span>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </span><span>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </span><span>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </span><span>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </span><span>others.</span></div> <div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </span><span>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </span><span>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </span><span>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </span><span>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </span><span>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </span><span>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support </span><span>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </span><span>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </span><span>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </span><span>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </span><span>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how </span><span>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </span><span>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </span><span>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience.

The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances.

The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </span><span>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </span><span>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </span><span>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </span><span>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </span><span>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </span><span>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </span><span>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote </span><span>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </span><span>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </span><span>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </span><span>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another.

We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </span><span>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider.

Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </span><span>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our </span><span>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </span><span>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in </span><span>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </span><span>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is based on an </span><span>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </span><span>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall </span><span>consideration).</span><span>12</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </span><span>the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </span><span>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a </span><span>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh </span><span>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </span><span>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </span><span>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship Global Principles.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Introduction</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As stewards of our clients’ investments, BlackRock believes it has a responsibility to engage with management teams and/or </span><span>board members on material business issues and, for those clients who have given us authority, to vote proxies in the best </span><span>long-term economic interests of their assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the </span><span>“</span><span>Guidelines</span><span>”</span><span>) summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>BIS</span><span>”</span><span>) philosophy and approach to engagement and voting, as well as our view of governance best practices and the roles </span><span>and responsibilities of boards and directors for publicly listed U.S. companies. These Guidelines are not intended to limit the </span><span>analysis of individual issues at specific companies or provide a guide to how BIS will engage and/or vote in every instance. </span><span>They are to be applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company, as well </span><span>as individual ballot items at shareholder meetings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These guidelines are divided into eight key themes, which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of </span><span>shareholder meetings:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>General corporate governance matters</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An effective and well-functioning board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of </span><span>shareholders’ interests, inducting the establishment of appropriate governance structures that facilitate oversight of </span><span>management and the company’s strategic initiatives. As part of their responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to </span><span>shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction, operations, and risk management of the company. For this reason, BIS sees </span><span>engagement with and the election of directors as one of our most critical responsibilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disclosure of material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and value creation, including, when relevant, </span><span>material sustainability-related factors, is essential for shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively </span><span>the board is identifying, managing, and mitigating risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately demonstrated, through actions and/or disclosures, how material issues are </span><span>appropriately identified, managed, and overseen, we will consider voting against the re-election of those directors </span><span>responsible for the oversight of such issues, as indicated below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that a majority of the directors on the board should be independent to ensure objectivity in the decision-making </span><span>of the board and its ability to oversee management. In addition, all members of audit, compensation, and </span><span>nominating/governance committees should be independent. Our view of independence may vary from listing standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Common impediments to independence may include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Employment as a senior executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five years</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>An equity ownership in the company in excess of 20%</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or relationship (professional or personal) which could, or could reasonably be </span><span>perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and its </span><span>shareholders.

In particular, where a director maintains a Chair role of a publicly listed company in European markets, we </span><span>may consider that responsibility as equal to two board commitments, consistent with our EMEA Proxy Voting Guidelines. We </span><span>will take the total number of board commitments across our global policies into account for director elections.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk oversight</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies should have an established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing business and material risks. </span><span>Independent directors should have access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure </span><span>they can properly oversee risk. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk management, mitigation, and </span><span>reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to </span><span>changes in corporate strategy and/or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosures provide </span><span>investors with a sense of the company’s long-term risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s </span><span>oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing </span><span>risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Structure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Classified board of directors/staggered terms</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Directors should be re-elected annually; classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a </span><span>board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we </span><span>may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure.

However, in </span><span>these instances, boards should periodically review the rationale for a classified structure and consider when annual elections </span><span>might be more appropriate.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns about a specific director, we may choose to vote against the </span><span>directors up for election at the time (see </span><span>“</span><span>Shareholder rights</span><span>”</span><span> for additional detail).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independent leadership</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are two commonly accepted structures for independent leadership to balance the CEO role in the boardroom: 1) an </span><span>independent Chair; or 2) a Lead Independent director when the roles of Chair and CEO are combined, or when the Chair is </span><span>otherwise not independent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership </span><span>structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</span><span>17</span><span> However, BIS may vote against the most senior non-executive </span><span>member of the board when appropriate independence is lacking in designated leadership roles.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that the board chooses to have a combined Chair/CEO or a non-independent Chair, we support the designation </span><span>of a Lead Independent director, with the ability to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of </span><span>the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent directors. These roles and responsibilities should be </span><span>disclosed and easily accessible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following table illustrates examples</span><span>18</span><span> of responsibilities under each board leadership model:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>CEO and management succession planning</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Companies should have a robust CEO and senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed </span><span>and updated on a regular basis. Succession planning should cover scenarios over both the long-term, consistent with the </span><span>strategic direction of the company and identified leadership needs over time, as well as the short-term, in the event of an </span><span>unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain their executive succession planning process, </span><span>including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information </span><span>commonly associated with this exercise.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>During a CEO transition, companies may elect for the departing CEO to maintain a role in the boardroom. We ask for </span><span>disclosures to understand the timeframe and responsibilities of this role. In such instances, we typically look for the board to </span><span>have appropriate independent leadership structures in place. (See chart above.)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director</span><span> </span><span>compensation</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>equity</span><span> programs</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation for directors should generally be structured to attract and retain directors, while also aligning their interests </span><span>with those of shareholders. In our view, director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value </span><span>creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board composition and effectiveness</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director</span><span> </span><span>qualifications</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>skills</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We encourage boards to periodically review director qualifications and skills to ensure relevant experience and diverse </span><span>perspectives are represented in the boardroom. To this end, performance reviews and skills assessments should be </span><span>conducted by the nominating/governance committee or the Lead Independent Director. This process may include internal </span><span>board evaluations; however, boards may also find it useful to periodically conduct an assessment with a third party. We </span><span>encourage boards to disclose their approach to evaluations, including objectives of the evaluation; if an external party </span><span>conducts the evaluation; the frequency of the evaluations; and, whether that evaluation occurs on an individual director </span><span>basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>term</span><span> </span><span>limits and</span><span> </span><span>director</span><span> tenure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where boards find that age limits or term limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board </span><span>refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits. BIS will also consider the average board </span><span>tenure to evaluate processes for board renewal. We may oppose boards that appear to have an insufficient mix of short-, </span><span>medium-, and long-tenured directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As noted above, highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business </span><span>enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions. In our view, a strong </span><span>board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and contributing to the most important </span><span>management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the boardroom. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding ‘group think’ in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ ethnicity, and age.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees, and communities. Self- identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought—in the boardroom, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company—leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>19</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the boardroom contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the boardroom can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In the U.S., we believe that boards should aspire to at least 30% diversity of membership,</span><span>20</span><span> and we encourage large </span><span>companies, such as those in the S&amp;P 500, to lead in achieving this standard. In our view, an informative indicator of diversity </span><span>for such companies is having at least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group.</span><span>21</span><span> </span><span>We recognize that it may take time and that companies with smaller market capitalizations and in certain sectors may face </span><span>more challenges in pursuing diversity. Among these smaller companies, we look for the presence of diversity and take into </span><span>consideration the progress that companies are making.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to help investors understand overall diversity, we look to boards to disclose:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How diversity, including demographic factors and professional characteristics, is considered in board composition, given </span><span>the company’s long-term strategy and business model</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How directors’ professional characteristics, which may include domain expertise such as finance or technology, and </span><span>sector- or market-specific experience, are complementary and link to the company’s long-term strategy</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The process by which candidates for board positions are identified, including whether professional firms or other </span><span>resources outside of incumbent directors’ networks are engaged to identify and/or assess candidates, and whether a </span><span>diverse slate of nominees is considered for all available board nominations</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent that, based on our assessment of corporate disclosures, a company has not adequately explained their </span><span>approach to diversity in their board composition, we may vote against members of the nominating/governance committee. </span><span>Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to board diversity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>size</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We typically defer to the board in setting the appropriate size and believe that directors are generally in the best position to </span><span>assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or </span><span>individual directors if, in our view, the board is ineffective in its oversight, either because it is too small to allow for the </span><span>necessary range of skills and experience or too large to function efficiently.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board responsiveness and shareholder rights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where we determine that a board has not acted in the best interests of the company’s shareholders, or takes action to </span><span>unreasonably limit shareholder rights, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or individual directors. Common </span><span>circumstances are illustrated below:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance committee, where a </span><span>board implements or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance committee, where a </span><span>board amends the charter/articles/bylaws and where the effect may be to entrench directors or to unreasonably reduce </span><span>shareholder rights</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Members of the compensation committee where the company has repriced options without shareholder approval If a </span><span>board maintains a classified structure, it is possible that the director(s) or committee members with whom we have a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> <div><span>We take a case-by-case approach and consider the size of the board in our evaluation of overall composition and diversity. Business model, strategy, </span><span>location, and company size may also impact our analysis of board diversity. We acknowledge that these factors may also play into the various </span><span>elements of diversity that a board may attract. We look for disclosures from companies to help us understand their approach and do not prescribe any </span><span>particular board composition.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> <div><span>Including, but not limited to, individuals who identify as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, or </span><span>Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; individuals who identify as LGBTQ+; individuals who identify as underrepresented based on national, Indigenous, </span><span>religious, or cultural identity; individuals with disabilities; and veterans.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>particular concern may not be subject to election in the year that the concern arises. In such situations, we may register </span><span>our concern by voting against the most relevant director(s) up for election.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Responsiveness to shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A board should be engaged and responsive to the company’s shareholders, including acknowledging voting outcomes for </span><span>director elections, compensation, shareholder proposals, and other ballot items. Where we determine that a board has not </span><span>substantially addressed shareholder concerns that we deem material to the business, we may vote against the responsible </span><span>committees and/or individual directors. Common circumstances are illustrated below:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director, members of the nominating/governance committee, and/or the </span><span>longest tenured director(s), where we observe a lack of board responsiveness to shareholders, evidence of board </span><span>entrenchment, and/or failure to plan for adequate board member succession</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The chair of the nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating/governance committee </span><span>member with the longest tenure, where board member(s) at the most recent election of directors have received against </span><span>votes from more than 25% of shares voted, and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder </span><span>concerns. This may not apply in cases where BIS did not support the initial vote against such board member(s)</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and/or members of the nominating/governance committee, </span><span>where a board fails to consider shareholder proposals that (1) receive substantial support, and (2) in our view, have a </span><span>material impact on the business, shareholder rights, or the potential for long-term value creation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Majority vote requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Directors should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted. We will normally support proposals seeking to </span><span>introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority vote standards generally assist in ensuring </span><span>that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. As a best </span><span>practice, companies with either a majority vote standard or a plurality vote standard should adopt a resignation policy for </span><span>directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where the company already has a sufficiently </span><span>robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We note that majority voting may not be appropriate in all circumstances, for example, in the context of a contested election, </span><span>or for majority-controlled companies or those with concentrated ownership structures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative voting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As stated above, a majority vote standard is generally in the best long-term interests of shareholders, as it ensures director </span><span>accountability through the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose </span><span>proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or </span><span>director candidates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS recognizes the critical importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s </span><span>financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board </span><span>responsible for overseeing the management of the independent auditor and the internal audit function at a company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We may vote against the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing. We </span><span>look to public disclosures for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit </span><span>committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take </span><span>particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we look for timely </span><span>disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent </span><span>auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a </span><span>significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice, we may also vote against ratification.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. </span><span>We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, companies </span><span>that have implemented dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis, or as </span><span>company circumstances change. Companies with multiple share classes should receive shareholder approval of their capital </span><span>structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated </span><span>shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling </span><span>structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Where companies are unwilling to voluntarily </span><span>implement </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one vote</span><span>”</span><span> within a specified timeframe, or are unresponsive to shareholder feedback for change over </span><span>time, we generally support shareholder proposals to recapitalize stock into a single voting class.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Blank check preferred stock</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, </span><span>dividend distribution, and other rights (</span><span>“</span><span>blank check</span><span>”</span><span> preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from </span><span>shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish </span><span>voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of </span><span>stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the company:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has committed publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has a history of using blank check preferred stock for financings</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-</span><span>takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Increase in authorized common shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS will evaluate requests to increase authorized shares on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with industry-specific norms </span><span>and potential dilution, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, </span><span>dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Stock splits</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally support stock splits that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a </span><span>share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where </span><span>the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g., one class is reduced while others remain at pre-split </span><span>levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not proportionately reduce the company’s authorized stock, </span><span>we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, transactions, and other special situations</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, and transactions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions – including business combinations involving Special Purpose </span><span>Acquisition Companies (</span><span>“</span><span>SPACs</span><span>”</span><span>) – BIS’ primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of our clients as </span><span>shareholders. Boards should clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale for any proposed transactions or material </span><span>changes to the business. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it has the potential to </span><span>enhance long-term shareholder value. While mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, business combinations, and other special </span><span>transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such </span><span>as:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the </span><span>share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger announcement.

We evaluate a number of factors, </span><span>which may include: the qualifications and past performance of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the </span><span>concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the ownership stake and </span><span>holding period of the dissident; the likelihood that the dissident’s strategy will produce the desired change; and whether the </span><span>dissident represents the best option for enhancing long-term shareholder value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We will evaluate the actions that the company has taken to limit shareholders’ ability to exercise the right to nominate </span><span>dissident director candidates, including those actions taken absent the immediate threat of a contested situation. BIS may </span><span>take voting action against directors (up to and including the full board) where those actions are viewed as egregiously </span><span>infringing on shareholder rights.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We will consider a variety of possible voting outcomes in contested situations, including the ability to support a mix of </span><span>management and dissident nominees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison pill plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although </span><span>we have historically opposed most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable </span><span>“</span><span>qualifying offer clause.</span><span>”</span><span> Such </span><span>clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is </span><span>renewed. These clauses also tend to specify that an all-cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of </span><span>financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote or </span><span>requires the board to seek the written consent of shareholders, where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. </span><span>We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be </span><span>associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders. Lastly, we look for shareholder approval of poison </span><span>pill plans within one year of adoption of implementation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reimbursement of expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations </span><span>where we support the shareholder campaign. Introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize disruptive </span><span>and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A company’s board of directors should put in place a compensation structure that balances incentivizing, rewarding, and </span><span>retaining executives appropriately across a wide range of business outcomes. This structure should be aligned with </span><span>shareholder interests, particularly the generation of sustainable, long-term value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The compensation committee should carefully consider the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals </span><span>the board is focused on incentivizing. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate </span><span>appropriate and rigorous performance metrics, consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. Performance-based </span><span>compensation should include metrics that are relevant to the business and stated strategy and/or risk mitigation efforts. </span><span>Goals, and the processes used to set these goals, should be clearly articulated and appropriately rigorous.

These may include instances where shareholders nominate director candidates, oppose the view of management and/or the board </span><span>on mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions, etc.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of </span><span>the compensation committee, or equivalent board members, accountable for poor compensation practices and/or </span><span>structures.</span></div> <div> <div><span>There should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance that drives sustained value creation for our </span><span>clients as shareholders. Where compensation structures provide for a front-loaded</span><span>23</span><span> award, we look for appropriate </span><span>structures (including vesting and/or holding periods) that motivate sustained performance for shareholders over a number </span><span>of years. We generally do not favor programs focused on awards that require performance levels to be met and maintained </span><span>for a relatively short time period for payouts to be earned, unless there are extended vesting and/or holding requirements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation structures should generally drive outcomes that align the pay of the executives with performance of the </span><span>company and the value received by shareholders. When evaluating performance, we examine both executive teams’ efforts, </span><span>as well as outcomes realized by shareholders. Payouts to executives should reflect both the executive’s contributions to the </span><span>company’s ongoing success, as well as exogenous factors that impacted shareholder value. Where discretion has been used </span><span>by the compensation committee, we look for disclosures relating to how and why the discretion was used and how the </span><span>adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. While we believe special awards</span><span>24</span><span> should be used sparingly, </span><span>we acknowledge that there may be instances when such awards are appropriate. When evaluating these awards, we consider </span><span>a variety of factors, including the magnitude and structure of the award, the scope of award recipients, the alignment of the </span><span>grant with shareholder value, and the company’s historical use of such awards, in addition to other company-specific </span><span>circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help calibrate competitive pay; </span><span>however, we are concerned when the rationale for increases in total compensation is solely based on peer benchmarking.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results – both financial and non-financial – consistent </span><span>with the company’s strategic initiatives. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that </span><span>would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and </span><span>other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practices. Our publicly available </span><span>commentary provides more information on our approach to executive compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where executive compensation appears excessive relative to the performance of the company and/or compensation paid by </span><span>peers, or where an equity compensation plan is not aligned with shareholders’ interests, we may vote against members of </span><span>the compensation committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where there is a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> vote, BIS will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation </span><span>practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to </span><span>shareholders. Where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance, we will vote against the </span><span>management compensation proposal and relevant compensation committee members.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Frequency of </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS will generally support annual advisory votes on executive compensation. It is our view that shareholders should have the </span><span>opportunity to express feedback on annual incentive programs and changes to long-term compensation before multiple </span><span>cycles are issued. Where a company has failed to implement a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory vote within the frequency period that </span><span>received the most support from shareholders or a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> resolution is omitted without explanation, BIS may vote </span><span>against members of the compensation committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Clawback proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial </span><span>reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>proceeding, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not </span><span>limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically support </span><span>shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust clawback policy that sufficiently addresses </span><span>our concerns.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> <div><span>Front-loaded awards are generally those that accelerate the grant of multiple years’ worth of compensation in a single year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Special awards</span><span>”</span><span> refers to awards granted outside the company’s typical compensation program.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The most common </span><span>form of ESPP qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically support </span><span>qualified ESPP proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity compensation plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS supports equity plans that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of </span><span>shareholders. Boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the </span><span>intended alignment with shareholder interests, such as the excessive pledging or heading of stock. We may support </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and </span><span>whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain </span><span>“</span><span>evergreen</span><span>”</span><span> provisions, which allow for automatic annual increases of shares available for grant without requiring further </span><span>shareholder approval; we note that the aggregate impacts of such increases are difficult to predict and may lead to significant </span><span>dilution. We also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors, we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities—just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities—and how these factors are </span><span>considered within their strategy in a manner that is consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, </span><span>we look for companies to disclose strategies that they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to </span><span>their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global </span><span>warming is limited to well below 2°C, and considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>28</span><span> It is, of course, up to </span><span>each company to define their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely, and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>29</span><span> Yet, the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>30</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition—in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosures a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium-, and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to </span><span>use and contribute to the development of low carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </span><span>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition—and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize that these are provided on a good-faith</span><span> basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to </span><span>climate risk and the global energy transition.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Natural capital</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The management of nature-related factors is increasingly a core component of some companies’ ability to generate </span><span>sustainable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s strategy is heavily reliant on the </span><span>availably of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related risks. We look for such </span><span>companies to disclose</span><span>31</span><span> how they consider their reliance and use of natural capital, including appropriate risk oversight and </span><span>relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures </span><span>to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as in our </span><span>assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our </span><span>approach to natural capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, companies should also consider the interests of their key stakeholders. </span><span>While stakeholder groups may vary across industries, they are likely to include employees; business partners (such as </span><span>suppliers and distributors); clients and consumers; government and regulators; and the constituents of the communities in </span><span>which a company operates. Companies that build strong relationships with their key stakeholders are more likely to meet </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> <div><span>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </span><span>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us to do so, we </span><span>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> <div><span>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </span><span>transition as compared to the alternative.

Where we determine that company is not appropriately considering their key stakeholder </span><span>interests in a way that poses material financial risk to the company and its shareholders, we may vote against relevant </span><span>directors or support shareholder proposals related to these topics. Our publicly available commentary provides more </span><span>information on our approach.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conversely, we note that some shareholder proposals seek to address topics that are clearly within the purview of certain </span><span>stakeholders. For example, we recognize that topics around taxation and tax reporting are within the domain of local, state, </span><span>and federal authorities. BIS will generally not support these proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Human capital management</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A company’s approach to human capital management (</span><span>“</span><span>HCM</span><span>”</span><span>) is a critical factor in fostering an inclusive, diverse, and </span><span>engaged workforce, which contributes to business continuity, innovation, and long-term value creation. Consequently, we </span><span>ask companies to demonstrate a robust approach to HCM and provide shareholders with disclosures to understand how </span><span>their approach aligns with their stated strategy and business model.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Clear and consistent disclosures on these matters are critical for investors to make an informed assessment of a company’s </span><span>HCM practices. Companies should disclose the steps they are taking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion; job categories </span><span>and workforce demographics; and their responses to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO-1 Survey. </span><span>Where we believe a company’s disclosures or practices fall short relative to the market or peers, or we are unable to ascertain </span><span>the board and management’s effectiveness in overseeing related risks and opportunities, we may vote against members of </span><span>the appropriate committee or support relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more </span><span>information on our approach to HCM.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate political activities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to support public policy </span><span>matters material to the companies’ long-term strategies. These activities can also create risks, including: the potential for </span><span>allegations of corruption; certain reputational risks; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory, and compliance </span><span>considerations associated with corporate political spending and lobbying activity. Companies that engage in political </span><span>activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and mitigate risks, including board </span><span>oversight.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When depend on companies to provide accessible and clear disclosures so that investors can easily understand how their </span><span>political activities support their long-term strategy, including on stated public policy priorities. When presented with </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, BIS will evaluate publicly available </span><span>information to consider how a company’s lobbying and political activities may impact the company. We will also evaluate </span><span>whether there is general consistency between a company’s stated positions on policy matters material to their strategy and </span><span>the material positions taken by significant industry groups of which they are a member. We may decide to support a </span><span>shareholder proposal requesting additional disclosures if we identify a material inconsistency or feel that further transparency </span><span>may clarify how the company’s political activities support its long-term strategy. Our publicly available commentary provides </span><span>more information on our approach to corporate political activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General corporate governance matters</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>IPO governance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards should disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon a company’s initial public offering (</span><span>“</span><span>IPO</span><span>”</span><span>) are </span><span>in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also ask boards to conduct a regular review of corporate governance and </span><span>control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances </span><span>change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our letter on unequal voting structures, we articulate our </span><span>view that </span><span>“</span><span>one vote for one share</span><span>”</span><span> is the preferred structure for publicly-traded companies. We also recognize the potential </span><span>benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, these structures should have </span><span>a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and </span><span>supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we think that such arrangements may not be in the best interests of </span><span>shareholders over the long-term.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s </span><span>primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs themselves, and the market context of each specific </span><span>proposal on the agenda. If the relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional </span><span>judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</span></div> <div> <div><span>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a </span><span>NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the </span><span>ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a </span><span>particular subsequent date.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NRSROs may rate specific investments (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds), issuers (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) </span><span>and/or programs (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, commercial paper programs). However, certain types of investments may not be rated by NRSROs, </span><span>such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial </span><span>institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury </span><span>securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s </span><span>issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same </span><span>NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal </span><span>securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings for the same security (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>underlying,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>insured</span><span>”</span><span> and/or </span><span>“</span><span>enhanced</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>New issue securities (regardless of type) may not be rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary </span><span>prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities may include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the </span><span>underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase </span><span>a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: </span><span>(i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s </span><span>rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect </span><span>to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria </span><span>as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined </span><span>by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may </span><span>differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are </span><span>not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index </span><span>methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, </span><span>following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or </span><span>restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fixed-income securities which are unrated may expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay </span><span>principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the </span><span>investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors should note that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent </span><span>developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and short-term obligations of an issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Moody’s Ratings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Long-Term Obligations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Aaa:</span><span> Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Aa:</span><span> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A:</span><span> Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Baa:</span><span> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess </span><span>certain speculative characteristics.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The obligor’s capacity to meet its </span><span>financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>AA:</span><span> An obligation rated AA differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet </span><span>its financial commitment is very strong.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A:</span><span> An obligation rated A is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic </span><span>conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on </span><span>the obligation is still strong.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BBB:</span><span> An obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing </span><span>circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the </span><span>obligation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:</span><span> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. </span><span>BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and </span><span>protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BB:</span><span> An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing </span><span>uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate </span><span>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>B:</span><span> An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the </span><span>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely </span><span>impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CCC:</span><span> An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, </span><span>and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse </span><span>business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on </span><span>the obligation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CC:</span><span> An obligation rated CC is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet </span><span>occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>C:</span><span> An obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative </span><span>seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>D:</span><span> An obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating </span><span>category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that </span><span>such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the </span><span>stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </span><span>of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </span><span>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NR:</span><span> NR indicates no rating has been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P </span><span>Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note:</span><span> The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing </span><span>within the major rating categories.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Short-Term Obligations</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-1: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet </span><span>its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign </span><span>(+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A-2: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and </span><span>economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial </span><span>commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-3: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or </span><span>changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on </span><span>the obligation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>B: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor </span><span>currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead </span><span>to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>C: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, </span><span>financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>D: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D </span><span>rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes </span><span>that such payments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business </span><span>days will be treated as five business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </span><span>of a similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </span><span>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks </span><span>unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more </span><span>than three years will most likely receive a long-term debt rating.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SP-1:</span><span> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service </span><span>is given a plus (+) designation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SP-2:</span><span> Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes </span><span>over the term of the notes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SP-3:</span><span> Speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fitch Ratings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Long-Term Obligations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>AAA:</span><span> Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of </span><span>exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected </span><span>by foreseeable events.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>AA:</span><span> Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for </span><span>payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A:</span><span> High credit quality. A ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is </span><span>considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is </span><span>the case for higher ratings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BBB:</span><span> Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of </span><span>financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this </span><span>capacity.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BB:</span><span> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in </span><span>business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial </span><span>commitments to be met.</span></div> <div> <div><span>B:</span><span> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CCC:</span><span> Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CC:</span><span> Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>C:</span><span> Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, </span><span>depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have </span><span>comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note: The modifiers </span><span>“</span><span>+</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>-</span><span>”</span><span> may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such </span><span>suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories </span><span>below CCC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The </span><span>designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant </span><span>to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for </span><span>analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to </span><span>market risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or </span><span>security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the </span><span>relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as </span><span>“</span><span>short-term</span><span>”</span><span> based on </span><span>market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 </span><span>months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>F1:</span><span> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; </span><span>may have an added </span><span>“</span><span>+</span><span>”</span><span> to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>F2:</span><span> Good short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>F3:</span><span> Fair short-term credit quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>B:</span><span> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened </span><span>vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>C:</span><span> High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>RD:</span><span> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it </span><span>continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings only.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>D:</span><span> Default. Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>IS-SAI-02-0324</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> </body></html>
