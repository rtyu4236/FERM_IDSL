2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the communication services industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely

<p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Summary of Principal Risks” is amended to delete “Telecommunications Sector
Risk” and add the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Communication Services Sector Risk.</i></b> Companies in the communications sector may be affected by
industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, obsolescence of communications products and services due to technological advancement, a potential decrease in the discretionary
income of targeted individuals and changing consumer tastes and interests. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion of
Principal Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Prospectus entitled “A Further Discussion of Principal Risks” is amended to delete
“Telecommunications Sector Risk” and add the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Communication Services Sector Risk.</b> The communication services sector of a
country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may
negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of <font>pre-marketing</font> clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable.
Companies in the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological
innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The domestic telecommunications market is characterized by
increasing competition and regulation by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and various state regulatory authorities. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a
given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among
other factors, have led to consolidation of </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of
revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in state and federal government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment
industries (<i>e.g.</i>, companies engaged in television or radio broadcasting, publishing, motion pictures, music by recording artists, casinos, and recreation and amusement businesses) may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an
important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue. </font></p>
