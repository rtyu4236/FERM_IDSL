Securities of low size companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, low size companies may be less financially stable than relatively larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel.
