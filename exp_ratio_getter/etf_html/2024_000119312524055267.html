Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may </span><span>have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </span><span>favorable features.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s investments will generally follow the weightings of </span><span>the Underlying Index, which may result in concentration of the Fund’s investments in a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>particular sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity or entities in a particular country, group </span><span>of countries, region, market, sector or asset class. To the extent that its investments </span><span>are concentrated in a particular sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity or entities in a </span><span>particular country, group of countries, region, market, sector or asset class, the Fund </span><span>may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those bonds, may be </span><span>subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, </span><span>market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or other </span><span>assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal </span><span>payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of </span><span>credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the </span><span>terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit </span><span>rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit </span><span>ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal </span><span>payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may </span><span>worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Extension Risk. </span><span>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may </span><span>be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those </span><span>securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in </span><span>the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>High Yield Securities Risk.</span><span> Securities that are rated below investment-grade </span><span>(commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds,</span><span>”</span><span> which may include those bonds rated below </span><span>“</span><span>BBB-</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below </span><span>“</span><span>Baa3</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody’s), or are unrated, </span><span>may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated </span><span>securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield securities investments include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield </span><span>securities may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than </span><span>issuers of investment-grade bonds. In the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, claims of </span><span>other creditors may have priority over the claims of high yield securities holders, </span><span>leaving few or no assets available to repay high yield securities holders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse </span><span>changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic conditions may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income </span><span>securities. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its </span><span>market value risk. Ratings and market value may change from time to time, </span><span>positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Issuers of high yield securities may be unable to meet their interest or principal </span><span>payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer </span><span>developments, or the unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to </span><span>repurchase the security from the Fund before it matures. If the issuer redeems high </span><span>yield securities held by the Fund, the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds </span><span>with lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, </span><span>even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer dealers in the high yield </span><span>securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for </span><span>high yield securities by the dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid </span><span>than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>valuing certain of the Fund's</span><span> </span><span> securities than is the case with securities trading in a </span><span>more liquid market.</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default </span><span>or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, </span><span>as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the </span><span>Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional </span><span>bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, </span><span>for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying </span><span>Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the adequacy </span><span>and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to </span><span>emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or </span><span>less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and </span><span>its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income </span><span>markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only </span><span>periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and </span><span>significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value </span><span>of the Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, </span><span>decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading </span><span>volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in </span><span>certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an </span><span>issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal </span><span>or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the </span><span>value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor </span><span>management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of </span><span>patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate </span><span>restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those </span><span>securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. An issuer may also be </span><span>subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer </span><span>resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. The Fund may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S.</span><span> corporate issuers. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies </span><span>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth </span><span>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency</span><span> and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or </span><span>governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less </span><span>liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the </span><span>value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the </span><span>issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Prepayment Risk. </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt </span><span>obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause the </span><span>Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, </span><span>resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject </span><span>to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be </span><span>lost in the event of prepayment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, </span><span>including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S </span><span>under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of </span><span>purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of </span><span>time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there </span><span>may be relatively few potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse </span><span>market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial </span><span>condition of the issuer, the Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when </span><span>it may be advisable to do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices </span><span>lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also may be </span><span>more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing </span><span>the Fund’s NAV due to the absence of an active trading market. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased </span><span>will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and its value may decline </span><span>as a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> The economies of many countries or regions in </span><span>which the Fund invests are highly dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. </span><span>Reduction in spending on products and services by these key trading partners, </span><span>institution of tariffs or other trade barriers or a slowdown in the economies of key </span><span>trading partners may adversely affect the performance of any company in which the </span><span>Fund invests and have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including </span><span>variable interest entities associated with an underlying Chinese operating company) </span><span>subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a </span><span>considerable degree of economic, political and social instability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically </span><span>used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic </span><span>liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China </span><span>continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and </span><span>religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in </span><span>China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility,</span><span> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of </span><span>internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social </span><span>developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also </span><span>are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented </span><span>significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop </span><span>market mechanisms. However, government control over certain sectors or enterprises </span><span>and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including </span><span>restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to </span><span>particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. </span><span>Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects </span><span>on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. </span><span>Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market </span><span>sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the </span><span>Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, </span><span>volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack </span><span>of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese issuers, </span><span>such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other </span><span>sectors are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their </span><span>operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy may be adversely affected by, among other </span><span>things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports or a contraction in </span><span>spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, which </span><span>would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and </span><span>widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. </span><span>China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize </span><span>official currency exchange rates. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, </span><span>institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers (including as a result of </span><span>heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </span><span>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key </span><span>trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and companies </span><span>in which the Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change from time to </span><span>time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the </span><span>U.S. or other governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns of </span><span>such government. For example, certain foreign technology companies are subject to </span><span>U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. </span><span>The U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain </span><span>Chinese companies due to concerns about forced labor. Such restrictions may have </span><span>unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any action </span><span>that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with </span><span>orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may include companies that are subject to economic or trade restrictions (but not </span><span>investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these </span><span>restrictions do not include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected </span><span>to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic </span><span>policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, </span><span>nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on </span><span>foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, </span><span>Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. Heightened tensions or an outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between China and Taiwan may adversely impact China’s economy as well as </span><span>the global economy and the value of the Fund’s investments. Additionally, China is </span><span>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign </span><span>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity </span><span>and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact </span><span>China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations </span><span>between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including </span><span>Tibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and </span><span>violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may </span><span>adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula </span><span>could adversely affect the Chinese economy. Such risks, among others, may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as </span><span>a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China under the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one country, two systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to maintain the current </span><span>capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the </span><span>continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on </span><span>the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese </span><span>government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control </span><span>over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social </span><span>framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to </span><span>the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in </span><span>Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, </span><span>the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) </span><span>the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong </span><span>economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what </span><span>effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the </span><span>Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the </span><span>establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the </span><span>Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese issuers are not subject to the same </span><span>degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>issuers in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be </span><span>significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or </span><span>litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The </span><span>Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor </span><span>protection considerations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia.</span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) </span><span>to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could </span><span>be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could </span><span>materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Saudi </span><span>Arabian government places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian </span><span>issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on the Fund’s ownership of any </span><span>single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent the Fund </span><span>from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of </span><span>petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its </span><span>economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market </span><span>for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be </span><span>significantly impacted. Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of </span><span>Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. </span><span>Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged </span><span>significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an </span><span>ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that </span><span>Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically </span><span>experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other </span><span>countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the </span><span>future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which </span><span>could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of securities in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi </span><span>Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of </span><span>the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or </span><span>other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s </span><span>economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this </span><span>labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically </span><span>associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that </span><span>may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on </span><span>and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political </span><span>instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental </span><span>decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </span><span>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely </span><span>stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains </span><span>the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </span><span>the economy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest </span><span>in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that </span><span>could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, </span><span>such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in </span><span>substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers </span><span>as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the </span><span>requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried </span><span>out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with </span><span>various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may </span><span>be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>while the Underlying Index does not. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY </span><span>EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX </span><span>ETFs.</span></div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other </span><span>securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other </span><span>characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit </span><span>rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury </span><span>obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A </span><span>downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are </span><span>often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, a downgrade could also </span><span>result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the </span><span>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and </span><span>global economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding </span><span>needs, which may drive debt cost higher and lead the government to issue additional </span><span>debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises concerns that </span><span>the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they </span><span>are due. If market participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become </span><span>unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus increasing inflationary </span><span>pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and </span><span>imported goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing </span><span>effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns. Direct obligations of the </span><span>U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </span><span>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may </span><span>vary during the period that shareholders own shares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, </span><span>circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or </span><span>principal, such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would </span><span>result in losses to the Fund and substantial negative consequences for the U.S. </span><span>economy and the global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other </span><span>asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the </span><span>value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade </span><span>in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a </span><span>result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be </span><span>open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund </span><span>is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher </span><span>redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the securities not been fair </span><span>valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments </span><span>may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party</span><span> service providers.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and </span><span>settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and </span><span>depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may </span><span>make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may </span><span>compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be </span><span>subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care </span><span>of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets </span><span>are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive </span><span>governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of </span><span>their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they </span><span>must maintain and, potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by </span><span>agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by </span><span>these foreign government agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally </span><span>backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. </span><span>Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a </span><span>particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually </span><span>provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the </span><span>performance of the Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations </span><span>and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other </span><span>policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government </span><span>may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, </span><span>subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, </span><span>the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </span><span>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S.</span><span> agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial </span><span>reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries, and </span><span>potential restrictions of the flow of international capital.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have </span><span>begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized </span><span>companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that </span><span>have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have </span><span>suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a </span><span>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, </span><span>due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reference Rate Replacement Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be exposed to financial </span><span>instruments that recently transitioned from, or continue to be tied to, London </span><span>Interbank Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, </span><span>hedging strategies or investment value. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct </span><span>Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>FCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which regulates LIBOR, has ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In </span><span>April 2023, however, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings will continue </span><span>to be published under a synthetic methodology until September 30, 2024 for certain </span><span>legacy contracts. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad </span><span>measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury </span><span>securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used increasingly on a </span><span>voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that </span><span>implement a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates based </span><span>on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be </span><span>known. While some existing LIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a scenario </span><span>where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any </span><span>such alternative methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based </span><span>instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty </span><span>regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions </span><span>in certain existing instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments </span><span>using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the application of transition regulation, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. The </span><span>Fund may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease </span><span>to be published in the future.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>will subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are </span><span>subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in </span><span>more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater </span><span>market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, social, political or </span><span>economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically </span><span>found in more developed markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience economic instability, </span><span>including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant </span><span>devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative </span><span>effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these </span><span>countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious </span><span>and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence </span><span>and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may invest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which </span><span>the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of </span><span>securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and </span><span>does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such </span><span>measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging </span><span>market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts </span><span>of foreign trade and investment. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of </span><span>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, </span><span>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed </span><span>and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, </span><span>significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. </span><span>Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its </span><span>portfolio securities and could have an adverse effect on the Fund in seeking to achieve </span><span>its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain </span><span>emerging market countries. As a result, investments in certain countries in which the </span><span>Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of </span><span>assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and </span><span>repatriation of capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund based on the returns earned </span><span>on the Fund’s lending activities, including investment of the cash received as collateral </span><span>for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities </span><span>to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will </span><span>retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized Participants </span><span>on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF </span><span>Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank </span><span>may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or </span><span>funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>ISTB.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is </span><span>Nasdaq.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein.

It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the </span><span>Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The </span><span>Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term </span><span>capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have </span><span>held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of </span><span>15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income </span><span>exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% </span><span>U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with </span><span>incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates </span><span>and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the </span><span>year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated </span><span>as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your </span><span>Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Adjustments for inflation to the principal amount of an inflation-protected U.S. </span><span>Treasury bond held by the Fund may be included for tax purposes in the Fund’s gross </span><span>income, even though no cash attributable to such gross income has been received by </span><span>the Fund. In such event, the Fund may be required to make annual distributions to </span><span>shareholders that exceed the cash it has otherwise received. In order to pay such </span><span>distributions, the Fund may be required to raise cash by selling portfolio investments. </span><span>The sale of such investments could result in capital gains to the Fund and additional </span><span>capital gain distributions to Fund shareholders. In addition, adjustments during the </span><span>taxable year for deflation to an inflation-indexed bond held by the Fund may cause </span><span>amounts distributed in the taxable year as income to be characterized as a return of </span><span>capital.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when </span><span>aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and </span><span>redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More </span><span>information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance for the past five years.

An investor may incur costs </span><span>attributable to the difference between </span><span>the highest price a buyer is willing to </span><span>pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) </span><span>and the lowest price a seller is willing to </span><span>accept for shares of the Fund (ask) </span><span>when buying or selling shares in the </span><span>secondary market (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid-ask </span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Information</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund intends to make distributions </span><span>that may be taxable to you as ordinary </span><span>income or capital gains, unless you are </span><span>investing through a tax-deferred </span><span>arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or </span><span>an IRA, in which case, your distributions </span><span>generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Payments to Broker-Dealers </span><span>and Other Financial </span><span>Intermediaries</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you purchase shares of the Fund </span><span>through a broker-dealer or other </span><span>financial intermediary (such as a bank), </span><span>BFA or other related companies may </span><span>pay the intermediary for marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational </span><span>training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms </span><span>and reporting systems or other services </span><span>related to the sale or promotion of the </span><span>Fund. These payments may create a </span><span>conflict of interest by influencing the </span><span>broker-dealer or other intermediary and </span><span>your salesperson to recommend the </span><span>Fund over another investment.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund and BIL and BRS are the Sub-Advisers to the </span><span>Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe </span><span>BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most </span><span>recent NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a currency hedged securities index that is not representative of the </span><span>market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation </span><span>strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete </span><span>investment program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may </span><span>have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </span><span>favorable features.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Commodity Regulatory Risk.</span><span> The Fund is deemed</span><span> </span><span>a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> and BFA is </span><span>considered a CPO with respect to the Fund under the CEA. BFA is therefore subject to </span><span>regulation by the SEC and the CFTC. BFA is also subject to regulation by the NFA. The </span><span>regulatory requirements governing the use of commodity futures, options</span><span> </span><span>on </span><span>commodity futures, certain swaps or certain other investments could change at any </span><span>time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The CFTC and the U.S. commodities exchanges impose limits referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>speculative position limits</span><span>”</span><span> on the maximum net long or net short speculative </span><span>positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures contracts (or </span><span>options thereon) traded on U.S. commodities exchanges. CFTC rules impose position </span><span>limits on certain futures contracts (and options thereon) and physical commodity </span><span>swaps that are </span><span>“</span><span>economically equivalent</span><span>”</span><span> to such contracts. As a result of these </span><span>position limits, the size or duration of positions available to the Fund may be severely </span><span>limited.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Commodity Risk. </span><span>Companies whose performance is reflected in the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>or Underlying Index may be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, </span><span>including, where applicable, high volatility, changes in supply and demand </span><span>relationships, weather, agriculture, trade, pestilence, political instability, war, </span><span>catastrophic events, changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental </span><span>policies, action and inaction, including price changes due to trade relations. Securities </span><span>of companies held by the Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are </span><span>concentrated in a single commodity sector, may typically exhibit even higher volatility </span><span>attributable to commodity prices.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal </span><span>payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of </span><span>credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the </span><span>terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit </span><span>rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit </span><span>ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal </span><span>payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may </span><span>worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share price. The Fund’s </span><span>hedging strategy does not seek to mitigate credit risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currency Hedging Risk.</span><span> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that </span><span>the Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially </span><span>offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or </span><span>eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject </span><span>to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be </span><span>no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective. In seeking to track </span><span>the </span><span>“</span><span>hedging</span><span>”</span><span> component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward </span><span>contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) </span><span>designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities </span><span>held in its portfolio. NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward </span><span>contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can </span><span>increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could </span><span>result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In </span><span>addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the </span><span>likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an </span><span>underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate movements in the value </span><span>of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate </span><span>of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change </span><span>quickly and unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and </span><span>economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund invests. In addition, in </span><span>order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the </span><span>non-U.S. dollar component currencies may not be fully hedged</span><span> </span><span>at all times or the </span><span>hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. At certain times, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Fund may use an optimized hedging strategy and will hedge a smaller number of </span><span>non-U.S. dollar component currencies to reduce hedging costs. Governments from </span><span>time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt </span><span>policies designed to influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. </span><span>Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can </span><span>develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge </span><span>against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may </span><span>remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund </span><span>may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging </span><span>transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s </span><span>portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are </span><span>over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as </span><span>market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. </span><span>Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty </span><span>exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single </span><span>counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency </span><span>hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may </span><span>increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate from the Underlying </span><span>Index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>There is no assurance that the Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations </span><span>in the value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s </span><span>currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the </span><span>Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be </span><span>hedged, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the </span><span>effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, volatility in one or </span><span>more of the currencies may offset stability in another currency and reduce the overall </span><span>effectiveness of the hedges. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy </span><span>may also be affected by interest rates, which may differ among the affected countries. </span><span>Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and some or all of the </span><span>applicable foreign currency interest rates may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s </span><span>currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund </span><span>may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the </span><span>securities composing the Underlying Index when the local currency appreciates against </span><span>the U.S. dollar.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign currencies may have limited </span><span>access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government </span><span>regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues </span><span>and lack of market liquidity. These limitations and restrictions may impact the </span><span>availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the </span><span>Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into </span><span>contracts to purchase or sell the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the </span><span>Fund</span><span> </span><span>invests is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. </span><span>In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described </span><span>under </span><span>“</span><span>Derivatives Risk.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currency Risk.</span><span> Because the Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, </span><span>investors may lose money if one or more of the currencies of the non-U.S. markets in </span><span>which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or </span><span>limits on repatriation of such currency and the depreciation of one currency is not </span><span>offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund’s attempt to hedge </span><span>currency exposure to the depreciating currency or currencies is unsuccessful. </span><span>Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the </span><span>Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities comprising </span><span>the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the </span><span>value of the underlying currencies. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of </span><span>currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in </span><span>a geographic region in which the Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the </span><span>Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the value </span><span>of the underlying currency or currencies and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging </span><span>strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better </span><span>performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is </span><span>hedged from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors </span><span>in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to </span><span>hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging </span><span>transactions. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and </span><span>unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and </span><span>settling trades, as well as the holding of securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets (such as </span><span>currencies) by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile </span><span>prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to complete and settle, and </span><span>governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated </span><span>depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held </span><span>only to the standards of care of their local markets. In general, the less developed a </span><span>country’s financial markets are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and impact </span><span>business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the </span><span>Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, </span><span>impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or </span><span>redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact </span><span>business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, </span><span>reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional </span><span>compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and </span><span>transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the </span><span>functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may </span><span>be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund </span><span>has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management </span><span>systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans </span><span>and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that </span><span>prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go </span><span>undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and </span><span>systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its </span><span>shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Derivatives Risk.</span><span> The Fund uses deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the </span><span>currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated </span><span>securities held by the Fund. The Fund’s use of these instruments, like investments in </span><span>other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s returns, increase volatility and/or result in </span><span>losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the </span><span>characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly </span><span>in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also </span><span>subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will </span><span>not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the </span><span>fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency</span><span> </span><span>or currencies </span><span>being hedged. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the </span><span>resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could </span><span>expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to </span><span>value accurately. The Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions </span><span>as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. </span><span>BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, </span><span>currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause </span><span>the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of </span><span>leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory </span><span>requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and </span><span>may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default </span><span>under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses). In addition, the Fund's </span><span>use of derivatives may expose the Fund to risks related to potential operational issues, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such as documentation and settlement issues, systems failures, inadequate controls </span><span>and human error. Derivatives may also involve legal risks, including insufficient </span><span>documentation, insufficient capacity or authority of a counterparty, and legality and </span><span>enforceability of a contract.</span></div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>EU requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with </span><span>restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal </span><span>and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, </span><span>including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Additionally, </span><span>European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks that are </span><span>independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In particular, </span><span>the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global economic, </span><span>industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental </span><span>or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common </span><span>currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state </span><span>on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have </span><span>a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their </span><span>trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced </span><span>volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or </span><span>government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Extension Risk. </span><span>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may </span><span>be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those </span><span>securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in </span><span>the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, </span><span>as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the </span><span>Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional </span><span>bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, </span><span>for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying </span><span>Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the adequacy </span><span>and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to </span><span>emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or </span><span>less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and </span><span>its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income </span><span>markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only </span><span>periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and </span><span>significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value </span><span>of the Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, </span><span>decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading </span><span>volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in </span><span>certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities and other instruments to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be </span><span>adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or </span><span>unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities or </span><span>counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of its </span><span>securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor </span><span>management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of </span><span>patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate </span><span>restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those </span><span>securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. An issuer may also be </span><span>subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer </span><span>resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other </span><span>instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the </span><span>risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a </span><span>number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-Diversification Risk.</span><span> The Fund is classified as </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified.</span><span>”</span><span> This means that, </span><span>compared with other funds that are classified as </span><span>“</span><span>diversified,</span><span>”</span><span> the Fund may invest a </span><span>greater percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number </span><span>of issuers</span><span> </span><span>or in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties. As a result, the </span><span>Fund may be more susceptible to the risks associated with these particular issuers</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>counterparties or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting </span><span>these issuers</span><span> </span><span>or counterparties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies </span><span>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth </span><span>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency</span><span> and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or </span><span>governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less </span><span>liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the </span><span>value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the </span><span>issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>North American Economic Risk</span><span>. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a </span><span>significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of </span><span>the North American countries in which the Fund invests. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The </span><span>Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the </span><span>U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade </span><span>among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including </span><span>the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of </span><span>the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on </span><span>July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a </span><span>result, the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one </span><span>country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as </span><span>on the value of certain securities held by the Fund. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, </span><span>including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S </span><span>under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of </span><span>purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of </span><span>time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there </span><span>may be relatively few potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse </span><span>market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial </span><span>condition of the issuer, the Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when </span><span>it may be advisable to do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices </span><span>lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also may be </span><span>more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing </span><span>the Fund’s NAV due to the absence of an active trading market. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased </span><span>will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and its value may decline </span><span>as a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have </span><span>begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized </span><span>companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that </span><span>have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have </span><span>suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a </span><span>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, </span><span>due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> Economies in developed countries generally are </span><span>heavily dependent upon commodity prices and international trade and, accordingly, </span><span>have been and may continue to be affected adversely by the economies of their trading </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>partners, trade barriers, exchange controls, and managed adjustments in relative </span><span>currency values, and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation </span><span>rates. These countries may be subject to other protectionist measures imposed or </span><span>negotiated by the countries with which they trade, including the imposition of tariffs by </span><span>the U.S. or other importing countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including </span><span>variable interest entities associated with an underlying Chinese operating company) </span><span>subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a </span><span>considerable degree of economic, political and social instability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically </span><span>used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic </span><span>liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China </span><span>continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and </span><span>religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in </span><span>China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility,</span><span> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of </span><span>internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social </span><span>developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing </span><span>income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also </span><span>are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented </span><span>significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop </span><span>market mechanisms. However, government control over certain sectors or enterprises </span><span>and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including </span><span>restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to </span><span>particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. </span><span>Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects </span><span>on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. </span><span>Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market </span><span>sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the </span><span>Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, </span><span>volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack </span><span>of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese issuers, </span><span>such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other </span><span>sectors are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their </span><span>operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy may be adversely affected by, among other </span><span>things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports or a contraction in </span><span>spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, which </span><span>would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. </span><span>China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize </span><span>official currency exchange rates. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, </span><span>institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers (including as a result of </span><span>heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </span><span>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key </span><span>trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and companies </span><span>in which the Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change from time to </span><span>time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the </span><span>U.S. or other governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns of </span><span>such government. For example, certain foreign technology companies are subject to </span><span>U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. </span><span>The U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain </span><span>Chinese companies due to concerns about forced labor. Such restrictions may have </span><span>unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any action </span><span>that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with </span><span>orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index </span><span>may include companies that are subject to economic or trade restrictions (but not </span><span>investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these </span><span>restrictions do not include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected </span><span>to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic </span><span>policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, </span><span>nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on </span><span>foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, </span><span>Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. Heightened tensions or an outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between China and Taiwan may adversely impact China’s economy as well as </span><span>the global economy and the value of the Fund’s investments. Additionally, China is </span><span>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign </span><span>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity </span><span>and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact </span><span>China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations </span><span>between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including </span><span>Tibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and </span><span>violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may </span><span>adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula </span><span>could adversely affect the Chinese economy. Such risks, among others, may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as </span><span>a Special Administrative Region of the PRC under the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one country, two </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to maintain the current capitalist economic and </span><span>social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the continuation of economic and </span><span>social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on the government of China. Since </span><span>1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in </span><span>Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous</span><span> liberal political, economic, legal and social framework. Recent protests </span><span>and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of </span><span>the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause </span><span>uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar </span><span>trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) the U.S. dollar, which </span><span>has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong economy. However, it is </span><span>uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what effect the establishment of </span><span>an alternative exchange rate system would have on the Hong Kong economy. Because </span><span>the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the establishment of an alternative </span><span>exchange rate system could result in a decline in the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese issuers are not subject to the same </span><span>degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as </span><span>issuers in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be </span><span>significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or </span><span>litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The </span><span>Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor </span><span>protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the China Bond Market.</span><span> The Fund</span><span> </span><span>invests in the China </span><span>Interbank Bond Market through the northbound trading of Bond Connect. Bond </span><span>Connect allows investors to trade between the mainland China and Hong Kong </span><span>markets electronically, which eliminates the need for investor status and quotas that </span><span>were required under previous access models. Under the prevailing regulations in the </span><span>PRC, eligible foreign investors such as the Fund are allowed to invest in the bonds </span><span>circulated in the China Interbank Bond Market through Bond Connect. The settlement </span><span>and custody of bonds traded in the China Interbank Bond Market under Bond Connect </span><span>will be effected through the settlement and custody link between CMU, as an offshore </span><span>custody agent, and CCDC and SCH, as onshore custodians and clearing institutions in </span><span>the PRC. All bonds traded by eligible foreign investors through Bond Connect will be </span><span>registered in the name of CMU, which will hold such bonds as a nominee owner. </span><span>Therefore, the Fund will be exposed to custody risks with respect to CMU. In addition, </span><span>as the relevant filings, registration with the People’s Bank of China, and account </span><span>opening have to be carried out by third parties, including CMU, CCDC, and SCH, the </span><span>Fund is subject to the risks of default or errors and omissions on the part of such third </span><span>parties and may have limited remedies or no legal recourse at all to cure such defaults, </span><span>errors and omissions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The precise nature and rights of the Fund as the beneficial owner of the bonds traded </span><span>in the China Interbank Bond Market through CMU as nominee are relatively new and </span><span>untested areas of PRC law. The definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership </span><span>and beneficial ownership under PRC law differs from that in the U.S. and other </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>developed market jurisdictions, there have been few cases involving a nominee </span><span>account structure in the PRC courts and, as a result, the rights of beneficial owners are </span><span>uncertain. The exact nature of the Fund's remedies and methods of the rights and </span><span>interests of the Fund under PRC law are also uncertain.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Market volatility and potential lack of liquidity due to low trading volume of certain </span><span>bonds in the China Interbank Bond Market may result in prices of certain bonds traded </span><span>on such market to fluctuate significantly. The Fund investing in the China Interbank </span><span>Bond Market is therefore subject to liquidity and volatility risks. The bid-ask spreads of </span><span>the prices of such securities may be large, and the Fund may therefore incur significant </span><span>costs and may suffer losses when selling such investments. The bonds traded in the </span><span>China Interbank Bond Market may be difficult or impossible to sell on a timely basis or </span><span>at all, which may impact the Fund's ability to acquire or dispose of such securities at </span><span>their expected prices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investing in the China Interbank Bond Market through Bond Connect is also subject to </span><span>regulatory risks. The relevant rules and regulations are subject to change, which may </span><span>have potential retrospective effect, and there can be no assurance that Bond Connect </span><span>or certain features or systems thereof will not be materially altered, suspended, </span><span>discontinued or abolished. Furthermore, the securities regulation regimes and legal </span><span>systems of the PRC and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on </span><span>these differences. In the event that the relevant authorities suspend account opening </span><span>or trading on the China Interbank Bond Market, the Fund's ability to invest in the China </span><span>Interbank Bond Market will be adversely affected, limited, or curtailed altogether. In </span><span>such event, the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective will be negatively </span><span>affected and, after exhausting other trading alternatives, the Fund may suffer </span><span>substantial losses as a result. Further, if Bond Connect is not operating, a Fund may </span><span>not be able to acquire or dispose of bonds through Bond Connect in a timely manner, </span><span>which could adversely affect the Fund's performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Trading through Bond Connect is performed through newly developed trading </span><span>platforms and operational systems. There is no assurance that such systems will </span><span>function as expected or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in </span><span>the market. In the event that a relevant system does not function as expected, trading </span><span>through Bond Connect may be disrupted. The Fund's ability to trade through Bond </span><span>Connect (and hence to pursue its investment strategy) may therefore be adversely </span><span>affected. In addition, where the Fund invests in the China Interbank Bond Market </span><span>through Bond Connect, it may be subject to risks of delays inherent in the order </span><span>placing and/or settlement systems.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Bond Connect trades are settled in Chinese currency, the renminbi (</span><span>“</span><span>RMB</span><span>”</span><span>). This </span><span>means that the Fund will be exposed to currency risk, and it cannot be guaranteed that </span><span>investors will have timely access to a reliable supply of RMB. The RMB consists of an </span><span>onshore RMB (</span><span>“</span><span>CNY</span><span>”</span><span>) and an offshore RMB (</span><span>“</span><span>CNH</span><span>”</span><span>). The CNY is the official currency of </span><span>the PRC and is the currency of denomination for all financial transactions between </span><span>individuals, the state and corporations in the PRC. Hong Kong is the first jurisdiction to </span><span>allow for the accumulation of RMB deposits in the form of CNH outside the PRC. Since </span><span>2010, the CNH market is traded officially and regulated jointly by the Hong Kong </span><span>Monetary Authority and the PBOC. While CNY and CNH are the same currency, they </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>are traded in different and separate markets. Therefore, CNY and CNH can be subject </span><span>to different liquidity constraints and market forces, meaning their valuations can vary. </span><span>The RMB-denominated bonds included in the Underlying Index use CNY as the base </span><span>currency. As a result, to the extent that the Fund holds RMB-denominated instruments </span><span>in CNH, it could be subject to tracking error and potential foreign exchange transaction </span><span>costs associated with converting from CNH to CNY (and vice versa).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Under prevailing tax regulations, a 10% withholding tax is imposed on PRC-sourced </span><span>dividends and interest from non-government bonds paid to the Fund unless the rate is </span><span>reduced under an applicable tax treaty. Value Added Tax (</span><span>“</span><span>VAT</span><span>”</span><span>) is levied on certain </span><span>income derived by the Fund, including interest income from non-government bonds </span><span>and trading gains, unless specifically exempted by the PRC tax authorities. VAT </span><span>exemptions currently apply to debt securities traded in the China Interbank Bond </span><span>Market. On November 22, 2018, the PRC’s Ministry of Finance and State </span><span>Administration of Taxation jointly issued Circular 108 providing foreign institutional </span><span>investors with a temporary exemption from withholding income tax and VAT with </span><span>respect to interest income derived from non-government bonds in the domestic bond </span><span>market for the period from November 7, 2018 to November 6, 2021. On November 26, </span><span>2021, the PRC's Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation jointly issued </span><span>Circular 34 to extend the tax exemption period provided in Circular 108 to December </span><span>31, 2025. Circular 108 is silent on the PRC tax treatment with respect to non-government</span><span> bond interest derived prior to November 7, 2018. There is a risk the PRC </span><span>tax authorities may withdraw the temporary tax exemptions in the future and seek to </span><span>collect withholding income tax and VAT on interest income from non-government </span><span>bonds to the Fund without prior notice. If the tax exemptions are withdrawn, any taxes </span><span>arising from or to the Fund may be directly borne by or indirectly passed on to the </span><span>Fund, which may result in a substantial impact to its NAV. As with any NAV adjustment, </span><span>investors may be advantaged or disadvantaged depending on when the investors </span><span>purchased or sold shares of the Fund. Any changes in PRC tax law, future clarifications </span><span>thereof, and/or subsequent retroactive enforcement by the PRC tax authorities may </span><span>result in a loss which could be material to the Fund. BFA will keep the provisioning </span><span>policy for tax liability under review and may, in its discretion from time to time, make a </span><span>provision for potential tax liabilities if in its opinion such provision is warranted or as </span><span>further publicly clarified by the PRC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>will subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are </span><span>subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in </span><span>more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater </span><span>market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, social, political or </span><span>economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically </span><span>found in more developed markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience economic instability, </span><span>including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant </span><span>devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative </span><span>effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these </span><span>countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious </span><span>and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence </span><span>and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may invest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which </span><span>the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often </span><span>have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of </span><span>securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and </span><span>does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such </span><span>measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging </span><span>market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts </span><span>of foreign trade and investment. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of </span><span>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, </span><span>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, </span><span>significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. </span><span>Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its </span><span>portfolio securities and could have an adverse effect on the Fund in seeking to achieve </span><span>its investment objective.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain </span><span>emerging market countries. As a result, investments in certain countries in which the </span><span>Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of </span><span>assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and </span><span>repatriation of capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Russia.</span><span> Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, </span><span>in addition to those described under</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>Non-U.S.</span><span> Issuers Risk,</span><span>”</span><span> that are not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, </span><span>including:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk of delays in settling portfolio transactions and the risk of loss arising out of </span><span>the system of share registration and custody used in Russia;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Risks in connection with the maintenance of the Fund’s portfolio securities and cash </span><span>with foreign sub-custodians and securities depositories, including the risk that </span><span>appropriate sub-custody arrangements will not be available to the Fund;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that the Fund’s ownership rights in portfolio securities could be lost through </span><span>fraud or negligence because ownership in shares of Russian companies is recorded </span><span>by the companies themselves and by registrars, rather than by a central registration </span><span>system;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that the Fund may not be able to pursue claims on behalf of its shareholders </span><span>because of the system of share registration and custody, and because Russian </span><span>banking institutions and registrars are not guaranteed by the Russian government; </span><span>and</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that various responses by other nation-states to alleged Russian cyber </span><span>activity will impact Russia’s economy and Russian issuers of securities in which the </span><span>Fund invests.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Russia Sanctions.</span><span> Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Sanctioning Bodies</span><span>”</span><span>) have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking entities, including </span><span>banning Russia from global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. </span><span>The Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. </span><span>These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of </span><span>the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse </span><span>consequences to the Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the </span><span>immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, </span><span>impairing the ability of the Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or </span><span>dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these </span><span>sanctions has and may continue to impair the ability of the Fund to buy, sell, hold, </span><span>receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it </span><span>becomes impracticable or unlawful for the Fund to hold securities subject to, or </span><span>otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>affected securities</span><span>”</span><span>), or if deemed </span><span>appropriate by BFA, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in </span><span>connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may </span><span>also increase the Fund's transaction costs. The Fund may also be legally required to </span><span>freeze assets in a blocked account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, </span><span>which has impaired the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory </span><span>measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by the Fund. Due to the </span><span>freeze of these assets, including depositary receipts, the Fund may need to liquidate </span><span>non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of </span><span>Fund assets during this time may also result in the Fund receiving substantially lower </span><span>prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures, which </span><span>may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of the </span><span>Fund to receive dividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number of </span><span>countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, dividends), and prohibits Russian persons from entering into </span><span>transactions with designated persons from </span><span>“</span><span>unfriendly states</span><span>”</span><span> as well as the export of </span><span>raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russian </span><span>companies may be unable to pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund may be </span><span>unable to receive them.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the Moscow Exchange </span><span>(MOEX) and prohibit non-resident investors from executing security sales, and other </span><span>events have led to changes in the Fund's Underlying Index. The Fund’s Index Provider </span><span>has removed Russian securities from the Underlying Index. To the extent that the Fund </span><span>rebalances its portfolio and trades in non-Russian securities to seek to track the </span><span>investment results of the Underlying Index, this may result in transaction costs and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>increased tracking error. The Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian </span><span>securities, including those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Index has removed </span><span>Russian securities. This disparity will also lead to increased tracking error. The inability </span><span>of the Fund to trade in Russian securities may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to </span><span>meet its investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the </span><span>Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will resume.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Also, if an affected security is included in the Fund's Underlying Index, the Fund may, </span><span>where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing </span><span>or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the investment </span><span>results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative </span><span>sampling strategy may increase the Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities </span><span>constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, the Fund may not be able </span><span>to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in </span><span>significant tracking error between the Fund’s performance and the performance of its </span><span>Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia.</span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) </span><span>to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could </span><span>be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could </span><span>materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Saudi </span><span>Arabian government places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian </span><span>issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on the Fund’s ownership of any </span><span>single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent the Fund </span><span>from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of </span><span>petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its </span><span>economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market </span><span>for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be </span><span>significantly impacted. Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of </span><span>Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. </span><span>Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged </span><span>significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an </span><span>ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that </span><span>Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically </span><span>experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other </span><span>countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the </span><span>future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which </span><span>could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of securities in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi </span><span>Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of </span><span>the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or </span><span>other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s </span><span>economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this </span><span>labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically </span><span>associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on </span><span>and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political </span><span>instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental </span><span>decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </span><span>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely </span><span>stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains </span><span>the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </span><span>the economy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has </span><span>caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest </span><span>in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk.</span><span> An investment in sovereign or </span><span>quasi-sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt </span><span>obligations. Sovereign debt includes securities issued by or guaranteed by a foreign </span><span>sovereign government, and quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued by or </span><span>guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. The </span><span>issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or </span><span>unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited </span><span>recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial </span><span>condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of a sovereign debt </span><span>obligation to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of </span><span>sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of corporate debt obligations and may </span><span>affect the Fund's NAV. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and </span><span>less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. These risks may be more </span><span>pronounced with respect to non-U.S. sovereign debt than with respect to U.S. </span><span>government debt. Several countries in which the Fund invests have defaulted on their </span><span>sovereign debt obligations in the past or encountered downgrades of their sovereign </span><span>debt obligations, and those countries (or other countries) may default or risk further </span><span>downgrades in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a </span><span>derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. </span><span>Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may </span><span>adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its </span><span>investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as </span><span>ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject </span><span>to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such </span><span>provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of </span><span>taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In </span><span>addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may </span><span>be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by </span><span>the IRS. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of the Fund's currency hedging strategy, the Fund may match foreign currency </span><span>forward contracts with the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities whose currency risk </span><span>is intended to be hedged wholly or partially by such contracts. If the Fund were to </span><span>perform such matching for income tax purposes, this matching would potentially result </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>in the Fund’s deferral for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the realized gains or </span><span>losses attributable to foreign currency forward contracts until such gains or losses </span><span>offset the currency-related losses on the matched non-U.S. dollar denominated </span><span>securities. If the IRS were to disagree with such deferral treatment or the matching </span><span>methodology used, the Fund's income could become undistributed and incur tax </span><span>liabilities. The Fund may reevaluate, adjust, begin, or discontinue the matching of such </span><span>contracts in the future.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market </span><span>close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s </span><span>NAV), transaction and hedging costs incurred and forward rates achieved by the Fund, </span><span>the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the </span><span>valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through</span><span> tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of </span><span>capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the </span><span>Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other </span><span>reasons. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or </span><span>other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange </span><span>markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and </span><span>expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts </span><span>creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its </span><span>currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during </span><span>these periods. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND WILL EXPERIENCE HIGHER </span><span>TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or unwind </span><span>of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the </span><span>security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile </span><span>markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade </span><span>suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days </span><span>or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the </span><span>securities or other instruments in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets </span><span>denominated in non-U.S. currencies is translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing </span><span>market rates. This translation may result in a difference between the prices used to </span><span>calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, </span><span>could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on </span><span>days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, </span><span>or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the </span><span>securities not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing </span><span>services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive </span><span>governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of </span><span>their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they </span><span>must maintain and, potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Government Debt Risk.</span><span> Investment in debt instruments issued or guaranteed by </span><span>foreign sovereign governments can involve a high degree of risk. The governmental </span><span>entity that controls the repayment of debt may not be able or willing to repay the </span><span>principal and/or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt. A </span><span>governmental entity’s willingness or ability to repay principal and interest due in a </span><span>timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, the </span><span>extent of its foreign reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date </span><span>a payment is due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a </span><span>whole, the governmental entity’s policy towards the International Monetary Fund and </span><span>the political constraints to which a governmental entity may be subject. Governmental </span><span>entities also may be dependent on expected disbursements from other foreign </span><span>governments, multilateral agencies and others abroad to reduce principal and interest </span><span>arrearages on their debt. The commitment on the part of these governments, agencies </span><span>and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on the implementation of </span><span>economic reforms and/or economic performance and the timely service of such </span><span>debtor’s obligations. Failure to implement such reforms, achieve such levels of </span><span>economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the </span><span>cancellation of such third parties’ commitments to lend funds to the governmental </span><span>entity, which may further impair such debtor’s ability or willingness to timely service its </span><span>debts. Consequently, governmental entities may default on their debt. If a </span><span>governmental entity defaults, it may ask for more time in which to pay or for further </span><span>loans. There is no legal process for collecting sovereign debt that a government does </span><span>not pay nor are there bankruptcy proceedings through which all or part of the </span><span>sovereign debt that a governmental entity has not repaid may be collected. In the past, </span><span>certain governments’ countries have refused to honor their payment obligations on </span><span>issued debt.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by </span><span>agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by </span><span>these foreign government agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally </span><span>backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds </span><span>and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. </span><span>Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a </span><span>particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually </span><span>provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the </span><span>performance of the Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations </span><span>and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other </span><span>policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government </span><span>may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, </span><span>subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, </span><span>the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </span><span>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S.</span><span> agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial </span><span>reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries, and </span><span>potential restrictions of the flow of international capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).

The Sub-Advisers, subject to the </span><span>supervision and oversight of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board</span><span>”</span><span>) and BFA, are </span><span>primarily responsible for the execution of securities transactions and management of </span><span>specified assets outside the U.S. and Canada (for BIL) and in the People's Republic of </span><span>China (for BRS) in the Fund’s portfolio. If a Sub-Adviser provides services relating to </span><span>both portfolio management and trading, it is entitled to receive from BFA an amount </span><span>equal to 20% of BFA’s management fee, and if a Sub-Adviser provides services related </span><span>solely to trading, then it is entitled to receive from BFA an amount equal to 110% of the </span><span>actual pre-tax costs incurred by the Sub-Adviser.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will </span><span>retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized Participants </span><span>on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF </span><span>Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank </span><span>may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or </span><span>funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies.

The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>IAGG.</span><span>”</span></div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable </span><span>to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if </span><span>any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, </span><span>regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible </span><span>for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, </span><span>depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions </span><span>from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net </span><span>investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain </span><span>distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the </span><span>prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>38</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign </span><span>entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. </span><span>owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into </span><span>agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including </span><span>the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. </span><span>account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the </span><span>identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to </span><span>U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant</span><span> foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the </span><span>required information; and determine certain other information concerning their </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>39</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement </span><span>and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with </span><span>similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the </span><span>name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or </span><span>provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions </span><span>apply.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>40</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>41</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>42</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance for the past five years.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund and BIL is the Sub-Adviser to the Fund. </span><span>Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>Nasdaq</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent </span><span>NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may </span><span>have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </span><span>favorable features.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Commodity Risk. </span><span>Companies whose performance is reflected in the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>or Underlying Index may be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, </span><span>including, where applicable, high volatility, changes in supply and demand </span><span>relationships, weather, agriculture, trade, pestilence, political instability, war, </span><span>catastrophic events, changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental </span><span>policies, action and inaction, including price changes due to trade relations. Securities </span><span>of companies held by the Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are </span><span>concentrated in a single commodity sector, may typically exhibit even higher volatility </span><span>attributable to commodity prices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal </span><span>payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the </span><span>terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit </span><span>rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit </span><span>ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal </span><span>payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may </span><span>worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share price.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and </span><span>settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and </span><span>depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may </span><span>make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may </span><span>compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be </span><span>subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care </span><span>of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets </span><span>are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> <div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span><span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG </span><span>characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment </span><span>opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other </span><span>funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of </span><span>ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, </span><span>securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform </span><span>other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may </span><span>result in divergence of the Fund's overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the </span><span>Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or </span><span>third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends </span><span>on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be </span><span>given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider </span><span>may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG </span><span>objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews </span><span>or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the </span><span>relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the </span><span>Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain </span><span>securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet </span><span>the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a </span><span>security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts </span><span>any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index </span><span>Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the </span><span>Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of </span><span>the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria </span><span>and data used in such evaluation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new </span><span>ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and </span><span>impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to </span><span>develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over </span><span>time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Extension Risk. </span><span>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may </span><span>be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those </span><span>securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in </span><span>the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive </span><span>governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of </span><span>their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they </span><span>must maintain and, potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Green Bond Investment Strategy Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s investment strategy of investing </span><span>in green bonds limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to </span><span>the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds that do not have a </span><span>green bond focus. The Fund’s green bond investment strategy may result in the Fund </span><span>investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or </span><span>underperform other funds with a green bond focus. In addition, projects funded by </span><span>green bonds selected by the Index Provider may not result in direct environmental </span><span>benefits. Projects funded by green bonds also may be dependent on government tax </span><span>incentives and subsidies and on political support for certain environmental </span><span>technologies and companies. Green bond issuers may face increased government </span><span>scrutiny and may be subject to new regulations, including enhanced disclosure </span><span>requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, </span><span>as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the </span><span>Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional </span><span>bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, </span><span>for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying </span><span>Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the adequacy </span><span>and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to </span><span>emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or </span><span>less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and </span><span>its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund. For example, a bond with a five-year average duration could lose approximately </span><span>5% of its value if interest rates were to rise 1%. An increase in interest rates may lead to </span><span>heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income</span><span> investments, including those held by the Fund. Because rates on certain </span><span>floating rate debt securities typically reset only periodically, changes in prevailing </span><span>interest rates (and particularly sudden and significant changes) can be expected to </span><span>cause some fluctuations in the net asset value of the Fund to the extent that it invests </span><span>in floating rate debt securities. In addition, decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making</span><span> capacity may lead to lower trading volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask </span><span>spreads and less transparent pricing in certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an </span><span>issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal </span><span>or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the </span><span>value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor </span><span>management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of </span><span>patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states </span><span>and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts </span><span>operations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by </span><span>agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by </span><span>these foreign government agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally </span><span>backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds </span><span>and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. </span><span>Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a </span><span>particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually </span><span>provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the </span><span>performance of the Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations </span><span>and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other </span><span>policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government </span><span>may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, </span><span>subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, </span><span>the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </span><span>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S.</span><span> agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial </span><span>reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries, and </span><span>potential restrictions of the flow of international capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies </span><span>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth </span><span>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency</span><span> and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or </span><span>governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less </span><span>liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the </span><span>value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the </span><span>issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>North American Economic Risk</span><span>. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a </span><span>significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of </span><span>the North American countries in which the Fund invests. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The </span><span>Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the </span><span>U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade </span><span>among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including </span><span>the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of </span><span>the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on </span><span>July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a </span><span>result, the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one </span><span>country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as </span><span>on the value of certain securities held by the Fund. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, </span><span>including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S </span><span>under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of </span><span>purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of </span><span>time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there </span><span>may be relatively few potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse </span><span>market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial </span><span>condition of the issuer, the Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when </span><span>it may be advisable to do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices </span><span>lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also may be </span><span>more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing </span><span>the Fund’s NAV due to the absence of an active trading market. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased </span><span>will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and its value may decline </span><span>as a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have </span><span>begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized </span><span>companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that </span><span>have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have </span><span>suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a </span><span>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, </span><span>due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> Economies in developed countries generally are </span><span>heavily dependent upon commodity prices and international trade and, accordingly, </span><span>have been and may continue to be affected adversely by the economies of their trading </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>partners, trade barriers, exchange controls, and managed adjustments in relative </span><span>currency values, and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation </span><span>rates. These countries may be subject to other protectionist measures imposed or </span><span>negotiated by the countries with which they trade, including the imposition of tariffs by </span><span>the U.S. or other importing countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including </span><span>variable interest entities associated with an underlying Chinese operating company) </span><span>subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a </span><span>considerable degree of economic, political and social instability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically </span><span>used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic </span><span>liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China </span><span>continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and </span><span>religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in </span><span>China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility,</span><span> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of </span><span>internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social </span><span>developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing </span><span>income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also </span><span>are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented </span><span>significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop </span><span>market mechanisms. However, government control over certain sectors or enterprises </span><span>and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including </span><span>restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to </span><span>particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. </span><span>Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects </span><span>on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. </span><span>Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market </span><span>sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the </span><span>Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, </span><span>volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack </span><span>of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese issuers, </span><span>such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other </span><span>sectors are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their </span><span>operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy may be adversely affected by, among other </span><span>things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports or a contraction in </span><span>spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, which </span><span>would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. </span><span>China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize </span><span>official currency exchange rates. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, </span><span>institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers (including as a result of </span><span>heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </span><span>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key </span><span>trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and companies </span><span>in which the Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change from time to </span><span>time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the </span><span>U.S. or other governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns of </span><span>such government. For example, certain foreign technology companies are subject to </span><span>U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. </span><span>The U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain </span><span>Chinese companies due to concerns about forced labor. Such restrictions may have </span><span>unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any action </span><span>that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with </span><span>orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index </span><span>may include companies that are subject to economic or trade restrictions (but not </span><span>investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these </span><span>restrictions do not include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected </span><span>to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic </span><span>policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, </span><span>nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on </span><span>foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, </span><span>Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. Heightened tensions or an outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between China and Taiwan may adversely impact China’s economy as well as </span><span>the global economy and the value of the Fund’s investments. Additionally, China is </span><span>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign </span><span>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity </span><span>and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact </span><span>China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations </span><span>between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including </span><span>Tibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and </span><span>violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may </span><span>adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula </span><span>could adversely affect the Chinese economy. Such risks, among others, may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as </span><span>a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China under the principle of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>“</span><span>one country, two systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to maintain the current </span><span>capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the </span><span>continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on </span><span>the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese </span><span>government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control </span><span>over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social </span><span>framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to </span><span>the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in </span><span>Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, </span><span>the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) </span><span>the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong </span><span>economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what </span><span>effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the </span><span>Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the </span><span>establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the </span><span>Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese issuers are not subject to the same </span><span>degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as </span><span>issuers in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be </span><span>significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or </span><span>litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The </span><span>Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor </span><span>protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>will subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are </span><span>subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater </span><span>market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, social, political or </span><span>economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically </span><span>found in more developed markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience economic instability, </span><span>including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant </span><span>devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative </span><span>effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these </span><span>countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious </span><span>and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence </span><span>and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may invest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which </span><span>the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often </span><span>have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of </span><span>securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and </span><span>does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such </span><span>measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging </span><span>market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts </span><span>of foreign trade and investment. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of </span><span>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, </span><span>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed </span><span>and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, </span><span>significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. </span><span>Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its </span><span>portfolio securities and could have an adverse effect on the Fund in seeking to achieve </span><span>its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>emerging market countries. As a result, investments in certain countries in which the </span><span>Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of </span><span>assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and </span><span>repatriation of capital.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia.</span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) </span><span>to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could </span><span>be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could </span><span>materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Saudi </span><span>Arabian government places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian </span><span>issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on the Fund’s ownership of any </span><span>single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent the Fund </span><span>from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of </span><span>petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its </span><span>economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market </span><span>for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be </span><span>significantly impacted. Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of </span><span>Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. </span><span>Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged </span><span>significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an </span><span>ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that </span><span>Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically </span><span>experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other </span><span>countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the </span><span>future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which </span><span>could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of securities in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi </span><span>Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of </span><span>the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or </span><span>other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s </span><span>economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this </span><span>labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically </span><span>associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that </span><span>may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on </span><span>and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political </span><span>instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental </span><span>decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </span><span>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely </span><span>stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains </span><span>the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </span><span>the economy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has </span><span>caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest </span><span>in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that </span><span>could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, </span><span>such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in </span><span>substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers </span><span>as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the </span><span>requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried </span><span>out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with </span><span>various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may </span><span>be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH </span><span>SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK </span><span>SUCH INDICES.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Utilities Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in exchange rates, domestic and international competition, and governmental </span><span>limitations on rates charged to consumers. The value of regulated utility debt securities </span><span>(and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the </span><span>movement of interest rates. Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater </span><span>competition and may adversely affect their profitability. Federal legislation may </span><span>facilitate the construction of electric transmission lines not only by public utilities but </span><span>also by independent transmission developers, which could increase competition in the </span><span>wholesale electricity markets. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify </span><span>outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business, utility </span><span>companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate </span><span>restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these </span><span>companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities industry may have </span><span>difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing </span><span>large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; </span><span>face restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to </span><span>environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or </span><span>products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to </span><span>increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made or </span><span>natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for </span><span>utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control </span><span>utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, </span><span>regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that </span><span>regulatory authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will </span><span>be adequate to permit the payment of coupon payments on bonds issued by such </span><span>company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a </span><span>significant adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other </span><span>asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the </span><span>value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade </span><span>in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a </span><span>result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be </span><span>open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund </span><span>is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher </span><span>redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the securities not been fair </span><span>valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments </span><span>may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party</span><span> service providers.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Middle Eastern Economic Risk.</span><span> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no </span><span>democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may </span><span>adversely impact the companies in which the Fund invests and, as a result, the value of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Fund. Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise </span><span>substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Many economies in the </span><span>Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade </span><span>with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and their economies are </span><span>therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign </span><span>currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle </span><span>Eastern economies may be significantly impacted. A sustained decrease in commodity </span><span>prices could have a significant negative impact on all aspects of the economy in the </span><span>region. Middle Eastern economies may be subject to acts of terrorism, political strife, </span><span>religious, ethnic or socioeconomic unrest and sudden outbreaks of hostilities with </span><span>neighboring countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern </span><span>countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, </span><span>religious tensions or defense concerns, which may adversely affect the economies of </span><span>these countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant </span><span>unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many Middle Eastern countries periodically have experienced political, economic and </span><span>social unrest as protestors have called for widespread reform. Some of these protests </span><span>have resulted in a governmental regime change, internal conflict or civil war. If further </span><span>regime changes were to occur, internal conflict were to intensify, or a civil war were to </span><span>continue in any of these countries, such instability could adversely affect the </span><span>economies of Middle Eastern countries in which the Fund invests and could decrease </span><span>the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk.</span><span> An investment in sovereign or </span><span>quasi-sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt </span><span>obligations. Sovereign debt includes securities issued by or guaranteed by a foreign </span><span>sovereign government, and quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued by or </span><span>guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. The </span><span>issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or </span><span>unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited </span><span>recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial </span><span>condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of a sovereign debt </span><span>obligation to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of </span><span>sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of corporate debt obligations and may </span><span>affect the Fund's NAV. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and </span><span>less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. These risks may be more </span><span>pronounced with respect to non-U.S. sovereign debt than with respect to U.S. </span><span>government debt. Several countries in which the Fund invests have defaulted on their </span><span>sovereign debt obligations in the past or encountered downgrades of their sovereign </span><span>debt obligations, and those countries (or other countries) may default or risk further </span><span>downgrades in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Supranational Entities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in obligations issued or guaranteed by </span><span>supranational entities (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the World Bank, European Investment Bank, Inter-American </span><span>Development Bank, and Asia Development Bank), which are often chartered to </span><span>promote economic development and may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>interest when due. The government members, or </span><span>“</span><span>stockholders,</span><span>”</span><span> usually make initial </span><span>capital contributions to the supranational entity and, in many cases, are committed to </span><span>make additional capital contributions if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. </span><span>Because supranational entities loan money to or otherwise finance projects in </span><span>emerging markets countries, the Fund may also be indirectly exposed to risk factors of </span><span>investing in emerging markets. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of </span><span>the supranational entity will continue to make any necessary additional capital </span><span>contributions. Instability in the relationships between the government members </span><span>increases the likelihood that additional capital contributions are not made. If such </span><span>capital contributions are not made, the entity may be unable to pay interest or repay </span><span>principal on its debt securities, the Fund may have limited legal recourse in the event </span><span>of default, and the Fund may lose money on such investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund based on the returns earned </span><span>on the Fund’s lending activities, including investment of the cash received as collateral </span><span>for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities </span><span>to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>).

BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank </span><span>may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or </span><span>funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>BGRN.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is </span><span>Nasdaq.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the </span><span>Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The </span><span>Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term </span><span>capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have </span><span>held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of </span><span>15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income </span><span>exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% </span><span>U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with </span><span>incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates </span><span>and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the </span><span>year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated </span><span>as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign </span><span>entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. </span><span>owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into </span><span>agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including </span><span>the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. </span><span>account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the </span><span>identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to </span><span>U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant</span><span> foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the </span><span>required information; and determine certain other information concerning their </span><span>account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement </span><span>and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with </span><span>similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the </span><span>name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or </span><span>provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions </span><span>apply.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund and BIL is the Sub-Adviser to the Fund. </span><span>Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>Nasdaq</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent </span><span>NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund has not been categorized under the EU sustainable finance disclosure </span><span>regulation (</span><span>“</span><span>SFDR</span><span>”</span><span>) as an </span><span>“</span><span>Article 8</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Article 9</span><span>”</span><span> product. In addition, the Fund's </span><span>investment strategy does not take into account the criteria for environmentally </span><span>sustainable economic activities under the EU sustainable investment taxonomy </span><span>regulation or principal adverse impacts (</span><span>“</span><span>PAIs</span><span>”</span><span>) on sustainability factors under the </span><span>SFDR. PAIs are identified under the SFDR as the material impacts of investment </span><span>decisions on sustainability factors relating to environmental, social and employee </span><span>matters, respect for human rights, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may </span><span>have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </span><span>favorable features.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Central and South American Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Central and South American </span><span>countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, high levels of </span><span>inflation, currency devaluations, regime changes, government defaults and high </span><span>unemployment rates. Additionally, commodities such as oil and gas, minerals and </span><span>metals represent a significant percentage of the region’s exports, and the economies </span><span>of countries in the region are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices </span><span>as a result. The impact of any of the foregoing events in one country could have a </span><span>significant effect on the entire region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Commodity Risk. </span><span>Companies whose performance is reflected in the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>or Underlying Index may be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, </span><span>including, where applicable, high volatility, changes in supply and demand </span><span>relationships, weather, agriculture, trade, pestilence, political instability, war, </span><span>catastrophic events, changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental </span><span>policies, action and inaction, including price changes due to trade relations. Securities </span><span>of companies held by the Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>concentrated in a single commodity sector, may typically exhibit even higher volatility </span><span>attributable to commodity prices.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s investments will generally follow the weightings of </span><span>the Underlying Index, which may result in concentration of the Fund’s investments in a </span><span>particular sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity or entities in a particular country, group </span><span>of countries, region, market, sector or asset class. To the extent that its investments </span><span>are concentrated in a particular sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity or entities in a </span><span>particular country, group of countries, region, market, sector or asset class, the Fund </span><span>may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those bonds, may be </span><span>subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, </span><span>market, political, sustainability-related or regulatory occurrences affecting those </span><span>securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments </span><span>when due or otherwise honor its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund’s portfolio may include below investment-grade bonds, which generally are </span><span>subject to greater levels of credit risk than higher rated securities. There is the chance </span><span>that the Fund’s holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception </span><span>of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income </span><span>level and share price. Debt instruments are subject to varying degrees of credit risk, </span><span>depending on the issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the terms of the </span><span>obligation, which may be reflected in their credit ratings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and </span><span>settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and </span><span>depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may </span><span>make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may </span><span>compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be </span><span>subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care </span><span>of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets </span><span>are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>High Yield Securities Risk.</span><span> Securities that are rated below investment-grade </span><span>(commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds,</span><span>”</span><span> which may include those bonds rated below </span><span>“</span><span>BBB-</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below </span><span>“</span><span>Baa3</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody’s), or are unrated, </span><span>may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated </span><span>securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield securities investments include:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield </span><span>securities may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than </span><span>issuers of investment-grade bonds. In the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, claims of </span><span>other creditors may have priority over the claims of high yield securities holders, </span><span>leaving few or no assets available to repay high yield securities holders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse </span><span>changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic conditions may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income </span><span>securities. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its </span><span>market value risk. Ratings and market value may change from time to time, </span><span>positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Issuers of high yield securities may be unable to meet their interest or principal </span><span>payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer </span><span>developments, or the unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to </span><span>repurchase the security from the Fund before it matures. If the issuer redeems high </span><span>yield securities held by the Fund, the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds </span><span>with lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, </span><span>even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer dealers in the high yield </span><span>securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for </span><span>high yield securities by the dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid </span><span>than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>valuing certain of the Fund's</span><span> </span><span> securities than is the case with securities trading in a </span><span>more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default </span><span>or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, </span><span>as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the </span><span>Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional </span><span>bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, </span><span>for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying </span><span>Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the adequacy </span><span>and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to </span><span>emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or </span><span>less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and </span><span>its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income </span><span>markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only </span><span>periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and </span><span>significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value </span><span>of the Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, </span><span>decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading </span><span>volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in </span><span>certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an </span><span>issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal </span><span>or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the </span><span>value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor </span><span>management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of </span><span>patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate </span><span>restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those </span><span>securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. An issuer may also be </span><span>subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer </span><span>resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Middle Eastern Economic Risk.</span><span> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no </span><span>democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may </span><span>adversely impact the companies in which the Fund invests and, as a result, the value of </span><span>the Fund. Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise </span><span>substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Many economies in the </span><span>Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade </span><span>with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and their economies are </span><span>therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign </span><span>currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle </span><span>Eastern economies may be significantly impacted. A sustained decrease in commodity </span><span>prices could have a significant negative impact on all aspects of the economy in the </span><span>region. Middle Eastern economies may be subject to acts of terrorism, political strife, </span><span>religious, ethnic or socioeconomic unrest and sudden outbreaks of hostilities with </span><span>neighboring countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern </span><span>countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, </span><span>religious tensions or defense concerns, which may adversely affect the economies of </span><span>these countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant </span><span>unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many Middle Eastern countries periodically have experienced political, economic and </span><span>social unrest as protestors have called for widespread reform. Some of these protests </span><span>have resulted in a governmental regime change, internal conflict or civil war. If further </span><span>regime changes were to occur, internal conflict were to intensify, or a civil war were to </span><span>continue in any of these countries, such instability could adversely affect the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>economies of Middle Eastern countries in which the Fund invests and could decrease </span><span>the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by </span><span>agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by </span><span>these foreign government agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally </span><span>backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds </span><span>and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. </span><span>Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a </span><span>particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually </span><span>provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the </span><span>performance of the Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations </span><span>and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other </span><span>policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government </span><span>may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, </span><span>subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, </span><span>the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </span><span>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S.</span><span> agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial </span><span>reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries, and </span><span>potential restrictions of the flow of international capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies </span><span>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth </span><span>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency</span><span> and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or </span><span>governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less </span><span>liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the </span><span>value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the </span><span>issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Fund will invest in privately issued securities, </span><span>including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S </span><span>under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of </span><span>purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of </span><span>time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there </span><span>may be relatively few potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse </span><span>market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial </span><span>condition of the issuer, the Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when </span><span>it may be advisable to do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices </span><span>lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also may be </span><span>more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing </span><span>the Fund’s NAV due to the absence of an active trading market. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased </span><span>will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and its value may decline </span><span>as a result.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have </span><span>begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized </span><span>companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that </span><span>have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have </span><span>suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a </span><span>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, </span><span>due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> Economies in emerging market countries </span><span>generally are heavily dependent upon commodity prices and international trade and, </span><span>accordingly, have been and may continue to be affected adversely by the economies of </span><span>their trading partners, trade barriers, exchange controls, and managed adjustments in </span><span>relative currency values, and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or </span><span>inflation rates. These countries may be subject to other protectionist measures </span><span>imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade, including the imposition </span><span>of tariffs by the U.S. or other importing countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including </span><span>variable interest entities associated with an underlying Chinese operating company) </span><span>subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a </span><span>considerable degree of economic, political and social instability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically </span><span>used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic </span><span>liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China </span><span>continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and </span><span>religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in </span><span>China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility,</span><span> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of </span><span>internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social </span><span>developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also </span><span>are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented </span><span>significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop </span><span>market mechanisms. However, government control over certain sectors or enterprises </span><span>and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including </span><span>restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to </span><span>particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. </span><span>Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects </span><span>on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. </span><span>Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market </span><span>sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the </span><span>Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, </span><span>volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack </span><span>of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese issuers, </span><span>such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other </span><span>sectors are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their </span><span>operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy may be adversely affected by, among other </span><span>things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports or a contraction in </span><span>spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, which </span><span>would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and </span><span>widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. </span><span>China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize </span><span>official currency exchange rates. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, </span><span>institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers (including as a result of </span><span>heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </span><span>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key </span><span>trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and companies </span><span>in which the Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change from time to </span><span>time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the </span><span>U.S. or other governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns of </span><span>such government. For example, certain foreign technology companies are subject to </span><span>U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. </span><span>The U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain </span><span>Chinese companies due to concerns about forced labor. Such restrictions may have </span><span>unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any action </span><span>that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with </span><span>orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may include companies that are subject to economic or trade restrictions (but not </span><span>investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these </span><span>restrictions do not include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected </span><span>to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic </span><span>policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, </span><span>nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on </span><span>foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, </span><span>Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. Heightened tensions or an outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between China and Taiwan may adversely impact China’s economy as well as </span><span>the global economy and the value of the Fund’s investments. Additionally, China is </span><span>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign </span><span>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity </span><span>and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact </span><span>China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations </span><span>between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including </span><span>Tibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and </span><span>violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may </span><span>adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula </span><span>could adversely affect the Chinese economy. Such risks, among others, may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as </span><span>a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China under the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one country, two systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to maintain the current </span><span>capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the </span><span>continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on </span><span>the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese </span><span>government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control </span><span>over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social </span><span>framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to </span><span>the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in </span><span>Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, </span><span>the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) </span><span>the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong </span><span>economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what </span><span>effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the </span><span>Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the </span><span>establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the </span><span>Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese issuers are not subject to the same </span><span>degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>issuers in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be </span><span>significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or </span><span>litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The </span><span>Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor </span><span>protection considerations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are </span><span>subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in </span><span>more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater </span><span>market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, social, political or </span><span>economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically </span><span>found in more developed markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience economic instability, </span><span>including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant </span><span>devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative </span><span>effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these </span><span>countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious </span><span>and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence </span><span>and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may invest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which </span><span>the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often </span><span>have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of </span><span>securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and </span><span>does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such </span><span>measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging </span><span>market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts </span><span>of foreign trade and investment. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of </span><span>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, </span><span>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, </span><span>significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. </span><span>Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its </span><span>portfolio securities and could have an adverse effect on the Fund in seeking to achieve </span><span>its investment objective.</span></div> <div> <div><span>There could be additional impacts on the value of the Fund as a result of sustainability </span><span>risks, in particular those caused by environmental changes related to climate change, </span><span>social issues (including relating to labor rights) and governance risk (including but not </span><span>limited to risks around board independence, ownership and control, or audit and tax </span><span>management). Additionally, disclosures or third-party data coverage associated with </span><span>sustainability risks is generally less available or transparent in these markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain </span><span>emerging market countries. As a result, investments in certain countries in which the </span><span>Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of </span><span>assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and </span><span>repatriation of capital.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Frontier Markets.</span><span> Frontier markets are those emerging markets </span><span>considered to be among the smallest, least mature and the securities of the issuers of </span><span>which are the least liquid. Investments in frontier markets generally are subject to a </span><span>greater risk of loss than investments in developed markets or traditional emerging </span><span>markets. This is due to, among other things, smaller economies, less developed capital </span><span>markets, greater market volatility, lower trading volume, political and economic </span><span>instability, greater risk of a market shutdown, capital controls, delays or limits on </span><span>repatriation of local currency, insolvency of local governments, and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments than typically found in more developed markets. </span><span>Frontier markets are even more prone to economic shocks associated with political </span><span>and economic risks than are emerging markets generally. Many frontier market </span><span>countries may be dependent on commodities, foreign trade or foreign aid. As a result, </span><span>those risks traditionally associated with investments in emerging markets may be more </span><span>pronounced with respect to investments in frontier market economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia.</span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) </span><span>to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could </span><span>be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could </span><span>materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Saudi </span><span>Arabian government places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian </span><span>issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on the Fund’s ownership of any </span><span>single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent the Fund </span><span>from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of </span><span>petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its </span><span>economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market </span><span>for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be </span><span>significantly impacted. Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. </span><span>Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged </span><span>significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an </span><span>ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that </span><span>Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically </span><span>experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other </span><span>countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the </span><span>future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which </span><span>could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of securities in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi </span><span>Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of </span><span>the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or </span><span>other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s </span><span>economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this </span><span>labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically </span><span>associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that </span><span>may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on </span><span>and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political </span><span>instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental </span><span>decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </span><span>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely </span><span>stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains </span><span>the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </span><span>the economy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has </span><span>caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest </span><span>in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk. </span><span>Some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced </span><span>acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations </span><span>may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic areas and may adversely </span><span>affect their economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk.</span><span> An investment in sovereign or </span><span>quasi-sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt </span><span>obligations. Sovereign debt includes securities issued by or guaranteed by a foreign </span><span>sovereign government, and quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued by or </span><span>guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. The </span><span>issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or </span><span>unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited </span><span>recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial </span><span>condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of a sovereign debt </span><span>obligation to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of </span><span>sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations and may </span><span>affect the Fund's NAV. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. In the past, certain emerging market </span><span>countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld </span><span>payments of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal </span><span>and interest on their sovereign debts. Several countries in which the Fund invests have </span><span>defaulted on their sovereign debt obligations in the past or encountered downgrades of </span><span>their sovereign debt obligations, and those countries (or other countries) may default </span><span>or risk further downgrades in the future.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the </span><span>requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried </span><span>out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with </span><span>various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may </span><span>be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH </span><span>SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE </span><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK </span><span>SUCH INDICES.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Economic Risk.</span><span> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, </span><span>trading partner of, or foreign investor in, certain countries in which the Fund invests. As </span><span>a result, economic conditions of such countries may be particularly affected by </span><span>changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and </span><span>financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </span><span>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions </span><span>of such countries and, as a result, securities to which the Fund has exposure. </span><span>Circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or </span><span>principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such </span><span>non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy </span><span>and the global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other </span><span>asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the </span><span>value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade </span><span>in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a </span><span>result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be </span><span>open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher </span><span>redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the securities not been fair </span><span>valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments </span><span>may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party</span><span> service providers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>African Economic Risk.</span><span> Investing in the economies of African countries involves risks </span><span>not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed </span><span>economies, countries or geographic regions that may negatively affect the value of </span><span>investments in the Fund. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation </span><span>and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government intervention in </span><span>international trade, confiscatory taxation, imposition of capital controls and delays or </span><span>limits on repatriation of local currency, political instability, including authoritarian and/or</span><span> military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, civil war, and </span><span>social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest or </span><span>widespread outbreaks of disease.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The securities markets in Africa are underdeveloped and are often considered to be </span><span>less correlated to global economic cycles than markets located in more developed </span><span>economies, countries or geographic regions. Securities markets in African countries </span><span>are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market </span><span>capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, </span><span>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control and </span><span>heavy regulation of labor and industry. Moreover, trading on African securities markets </span><span>may be suspended altogether.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain governments in African countries may restrict or control to varying degrees the </span><span>ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in </span><span>those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa may require governmental </span><span>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors; may limit the </span><span>amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer; may </span><span>limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have </span><span>less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors </span><span>of those countries; and/or may impose additional taxes on foreign investors. These </span><span>factors, among others, make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in </span><span>Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more </span><span>developed countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Eastern European Economic Risk. </span><span>An investment in issuers located or operating in </span><span>Eastern Europe may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security </span><span>and economic risks specific to Eastern Europe. Economies of certain Eastern European </span><span>countries rely heavily on the export of commodities, including oil, gas, and certain </span><span>metals. As a result, such economies may be impacted by international commodity </span><span>prices and are particularly vulnerable to global demand for these products. Geopolitical </span><span>events including armed conflict or war, acts of terrorism, and other instability in certain </span><span>Eastern European countries may cause uncertainty in their financial markets and </span><span>adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. The </span><span>securities markets in some Eastern European countries are substantially smaller and </span><span>less developed, with less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges, </span><span>and may be less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in the U.S. or Western </span><span>European countries. In addition, investing in securities of issuers located or operating </span><span>in Eastern Europe may involve:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk of delays in settling portfolio transactions and the risk of loss arising out of </span><span>the system of share registration and custody used in certain Eastern European </span><span>countries;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Risks in connection with the maintenance of the Fund's portfolio securities and cash </span><span>with foreign sub-custodians and securities depositories, including the risk that </span><span>appropriate sub-custody arrangements will not be available to the Fund;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that the Fund's ownership rights in portfolio securities could be lost through </span><span>fraud or negligence as a result of the fact that ownership in shares of certain Eastern </span><span>European companies is recorded by the companies themselves and by registrars, </span><span>rather than a central registration system;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that the Fund may not be able to pursue claims on behalf of its shareholders </span><span>because of the system of share registration and custody, and because certain </span><span>Eastern European banking institutions and registrars are not guaranteed by their </span><span>respective governments; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Risks in connection with Eastern European countries' dependence on the economic </span><span>health of Western European countries and the EU as a whole.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other risks related to investing in securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern </span><span>Europe include: the potential absence of legal structures governing private and foreign </span><span>investments and private property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial </span><span>portion of the Fund’s assets invested in issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe </span><span>as a result of expropriation; and certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s </span><span>investment opportunities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investing in </span><span>issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests. In addition, </span><span>Eastern European securities markets are particularly sensitive to social, political, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>economic, and currency events that involve Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a </span><span>result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency or its </span><span>neighbors.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span><span>The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy </span><span>sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: changes in and volatility of </span><span>global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and spending on exploration and </span><span>production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and </span><span>tax treatment; changes in the actual or perceived availability of oil or other resource </span><span>deposits; the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions or import controls; war or </span><span>other geopolitical conflicts; negative perception; increased litigation; energy </span><span>conservation efforts; energy infrastructure developments or service failures; and </span><span>increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be </span><span>subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may </span><span>increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A </span><span>significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively </span><span>small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, </span><span>governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock </span><span>prices of companies in this sector.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in transactions involving, countries </span><span>that have less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, confiscation </span><span>of assets, foreign investment restrictions, nationalization or other adverse policies or </span><span>that are at greater risk of political and social unrest, coups or labor disruptions. Energy </span><span>companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or </span><span>loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment </span><span>malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber </span><span>incident, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious </span><span>consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an </span><span>adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy </span><span>companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other </span><span>companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>in the global economy. Energy production companies, especially those for oil and gas, </span><span>may also have to contend with service disruptions, pipeline and equipment leaks and </span><span>ruptures, explosions, fires, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, </span><span>discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous gases and other environmental risks.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s </span><span>large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 led to disruptions and increased </span><span>volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential </span><span>disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural </span><span>gas. The U.S. and other actors have, in response, enacted various sanctions and </span><span>restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions on imports of </span><span>oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as </span><span>the extent and duration of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and </span><span>associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and </span><span>depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments </span><span>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sustainability Risk.</span><span> Sustainability risk is an inclusive term to designate investment </span><span>risk (probability or uncertainty of occurrence of material losses relative to the expected </span><span>return of an investment) that relates to environmental, social or governance issues.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Sustainability risk around environmental issues includes, but is not limited to, climate </span><span>risk, both physical and transition risk. Physical risk arises from the physical effects of </span><span>climate change, acute or chronic. For example, frequent and severe climate-related </span><span>events can impact products and services and supply chains. Transition risk – whether </span><span>policy, technology, market or reputation risk – arises from the adjustment to a low-carbon</span><span> economy in order to mitigate climate change. Risks related to social issues can </span><span>include, but are not limited to, labor rights and community relations. Governance-related</span><span> risks can include but are not limited to risks around board independence, </span><span>ownership and control, and audit and tax management. These risks can impact an </span><span>issuer’s operational effectiveness and resilience as well as its public perception and </span><span>reputation, affecting its profitability and, in turn, its capital growth and ultimately </span><span>impacting the value of holdings in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These are only examples of sustainability risk factors, and sustainability risk factors do </span><span>not solely determine the risk profile of the investment. The relevance, severity, </span><span>materiality and time horizon of sustainability risk factors and other risks can differ </span><span>significantly across funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sustainability risk can manifest itself through different existing risk types including, but </span><span>not limited to, market, liquidity, concentration, credit and asset-liability mismatch risk. </span><span>For example, the Fund may invest in the securities of an issuer that could face </span><span>potentially reduced revenues or increased expenditures from physical climate risk </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, decreased production capacity due to supply chain perturbations, lower sales </span><span>due to demand shocks or higher operating or capital costs) or transition risk (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>decreased demand for carbon-intensive products and services or increased production </span><span>costs due to changing input prices). As a result, sustainability risk factors may have a </span><span>material impact on an investment, may increase volatility, may affect liquidity and may </span><span>have an adverse impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The impact of those risks may be higher for funds with particular sectoral or </span><span>geographic concentrations. For example, funds with geographic concentration in </span><span>locations susceptible to adverse weather conditions where the value of the </span><span>investments in the funds may be more susceptible to adverse physical climate events, </span><span>or funds with specific sectoral concentrations, such as investing in industries or issuers </span><span>with high carbon intensity or high switching costs associated with the transition to low </span><span>carbon alternatives, may be more impacted by climate transition risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All or a combination of these factors may have an unpredictable impact on the relevant </span><span>fund’s investments. Under normal market conditions, such events could have a </span><span>material impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Assessments of sustainability risk are specific to the asset class and to a fund’s </span><span>investment objective. Different asset classes require different data and tools to apply </span><span>heightened scrutiny, assess materiality, and make meaningful differentiation among </span><span>issuers and assets. To the extent consistent with the Fund’s investment objective, risks </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>are considered and risk managed concurrently, by prioritizing in part based on </span><span>materiality and on the Fund’s objective.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The impacts of sustainability risk are likely to develop over time, and new sustainability </span><span>risks may be identified as further data and information regarding sustainability factors </span><span>and impacts become available.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

The Portfolio Managers are responsible for </span><span>various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to, </span><span>investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of their respective portfolio </span><span>management teams to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment </span><span>strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of </span><span>their respective portfolio management teams who have more limited responsibilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>James Mauro has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since </span><span>2011. Prior to that, Mr. Mauro was a Vice President at State Street Global Advisors. Mr. </span><span>Mauro has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2011.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Karen Uyehara has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a senior portfolio manager </span><span>since 2010. Prior to that, Ms. Uyehara was a portfolio manager at Western Asset </span><span>Management Company (WAMCO). Ms. Uyehara has been a Portfolio Manager of the </span><span>Fund since 2021.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's SAI provides additional information about the Portfolio Managers' </span><span>compensation, other accounts managed by the Portfolio Managers and the Portfolio </span><span>Managers' ownership (if any) of shares in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.</span><span> State Street Bank and Trust </span><span>Company is the administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Fund. JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. serves as custodian for the Fund in connection with certain </span><span>securities lending activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts of Interest. </span><span>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including </span><span>BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Affiliates</span><span>”</span><span>)), and their respective </span><span>directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own </span><span>accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will </span><span>retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized Participants </span><span>on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF </span><span>Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services platform.

The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>EMB.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is </span><span>Nasdaq.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable </span><span>to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if </span><span>any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, </span><span>regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible </span><span>for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, </span><span>depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions </span><span>from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net </span><span>investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain </span><span>distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the </span><span>prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your </span><span>Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners.

Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.

Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>38</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund.

Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>39</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance for the past five years.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund and BIL is the Sub-Adviser to the Fund. </span><span>Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The </span><span>market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent </span><span>NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Index Provider</span><span> </span><span>relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including </span><span>information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor </span><span>BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider's calculation methodology or sources </span><span>of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may </span><span>have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </span><span>favorable features.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Central and South American Economic Risk.</span><span> Certain Central and South American </span><span>countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, high levels of </span><span>inflation, currency devaluations, regime changes, government defaults and high </span><span>unemployment rates. Additionally, commodities such as oil and gas, minerals and </span><span>metals represent a significant percentage of the region’s exports, and the economies </span><span>of countries in the region are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices </span><span>as a result. The impact of any of the foregoing events in one country could have a </span><span>significant effect on the entire region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Commodity Risk. </span><span>Companies whose performance is reflected in the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>or Underlying Index may be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, </span><span>including, where applicable, high volatility, changes in supply and demand </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>relationships, weather, agriculture, trade, pestilence, political instability, war, </span><span>catastrophic events, changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental </span><span>policies, action and inaction, including price changes due to trade relations. Securities </span><span>of companies held by the Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are </span><span>concentrated in a single commodity sector, may typically exhibit even higher volatility </span><span>attributable to commodity prices.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s investments will generally follow the weightings of </span><span>the Underlying Index, which may result in concentration of the Fund’s investments in a </span><span>particular sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity or entities in a particular country, group </span><span>of countries, region, market, sector or asset class. To the extent that its investments </span><span>are concentrated in a particular sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity or entities in a </span><span>particular country, group of countries, region, market, sector or asset class, the Fund </span><span>may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those bonds, may be </span><span>subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, </span><span>market, political, sustainability-related or regulatory occurrences affecting those </span><span>securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments </span><span>when due or otherwise honor its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund’s portfolio may include below investment-grade bonds, which generally are </span><span>subject to greater levels of credit risk than higher rated securities. There is the chance </span><span>that the Fund’s holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception </span><span>of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income </span><span>level and share price. Debt instruments are subject to varying degrees of credit risk, </span><span>depending on the issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the terms of the </span><span>obligation, which may be reflected in their credit ratings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and </span><span>settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and </span><span>depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may </span><span>make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may </span><span>compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be </span><span>subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care </span><span>of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets </span><span>are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Eastern European Economic Risk. </span><span>An investment in issuers located or operating in </span><span>Eastern Europe may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security </span><span>and economic risks specific to Eastern Europe. Economies of certain Eastern European </span><span>countries rely heavily on the export of commodities, including oil, gas, and certain </span><span>metals. As a result, such economies may be impacted by international commodity </span><span>prices and are particularly vulnerable to global demand for these products. Geopolitical </span><span>events including armed conflict or war, acts of terrorism, and other instability in certain </span><span>Eastern European countries may cause uncertainty in their financial markets and </span><span>adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. The </span><span>securities markets in some Eastern European countries are substantially smaller and </span><span>less developed, with less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges, </span><span>and may be less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in the U.S. or Western </span><span>European countries. In addition, investing in securities of issuers located or operating </span><span>in Eastern Europe may involve:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk of delays in settling portfolio transactions and the risk of loss arising out of </span><span>the system of share registration and custody used in certain Eastern European </span><span>countries;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Risks in connection with the maintenance of the Fund's portfolio securities and cash </span><span>with foreign sub-custodians and securities depositories, including the risk that </span><span>appropriate sub-custody arrangements will not be available to the Fund;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that the Fund's ownership rights in portfolio securities could be lost through </span><span>fraud or negligence as a result of the fact that ownership in shares of certain Eastern </span><span>European companies is recorded by the companies themselves and by registrars, </span><span>rather than a central registration system;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The risk that the Fund may not be able to pursue claims on behalf of its shareholders </span><span>because of the system of share registration and custody, and because certain </span><span>Eastern European banking institutions and registrars are not guaranteed by their </span><span>respective governments; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Risks in connection with Eastern European countries' dependence on the economic </span><span>health of Western European countries and the European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) as a </span><span>whole.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other risks related to investing in securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern </span><span>Europe include: the potential absence of legal structures governing private and foreign </span><span>investments and private property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial </span><span>portion of the Fund’s assets invested in issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe </span><span>as a result of expropriation; and certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s </span><span>investment opportunities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investing in </span><span>issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests. In addition, </span><span>Eastern European securities markets are particularly sensitive to social, political, </span><span>economic, and currency events that involve Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a </span><span>result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency or its </span><span>neighbors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>EU requires compliance by member states that are members of the eurozone with </span><span>restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal </span><span>and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, </span><span>including those countries that are not members of the eurozone.

In particular, </span><span>the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global economic, </span><span>industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental </span><span>or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common </span><span>currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state </span><span>on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have </span><span>a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their </span><span>trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced </span><span>volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or </span><span>government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant.

Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>High Yield Securities Risk.</span><span> Securities that are rated below investment-grade </span><span>(commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds,</span><span>”</span><span> which may include those bonds rated below </span><span>“</span><span>BBB-</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below </span><span>“</span><span>Baa3</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody’s), or are unrated, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated </span><span>securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default. </span></div> <div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield securities investments include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield </span><span>securities may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than </span><span>issuers of investment-grade bonds. In the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, claims of </span><span>other creditors may have priority over the claims of high yield securities holders, </span><span>leaving few or no assets available to repay high yield securities holders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse </span><span>changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic conditions may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income </span><span>securities. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its </span><span>market value risk. Ratings and market value may change from time to time, </span><span>positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Issuers of high yield securities may be unable to meet their interest or principal </span><span>payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer </span><span>developments, or the unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to </span><span>repurchase the security from the Fund before it matures. If the issuer redeems high </span><span>yield securities held by the Fund, the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds </span><span>with lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, </span><span>even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer dealers in the high yield </span><span>securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for </span><span>high yield securities by the dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid </span><span>than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>valuing certain of the Fund's</span><span> </span><span> securities than is the case with securities trading in a </span><span>more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default </span><span>or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds, </span><span>as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the </span><span>Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional </span><span>bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, </span><span>for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying </span><span>Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. In addition, there may be heightened risks associated with the adequacy </span><span>and reliability of the information the Index Provider uses given the Fund's exposure to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>emerging markets, as certain emerging markets may have less information available or </span><span>less regulatory oversight. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and </span><span>its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income </span><span>markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only </span><span>periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and </span><span>significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value </span><span>of the Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, </span><span>decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading </span><span>volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in </span><span>certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an </span><span>issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal </span><span>or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the </span><span>value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor </span><span>management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of </span><span>patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate </span><span>restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those </span><span>securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. An issuer may also be </span><span>subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer </span><span>resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Middle Eastern Economic Risk.</span><span> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no </span><span>democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may </span><span>adversely impact the companies in which the Fund invests and, as a result, the value of </span><span>the Fund. Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise </span><span>substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Many economies in the </span><span>Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade </span><span>with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and their economies are </span><span>therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign </span><span>currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle </span><span>Eastern economies may be significantly impacted. A sustained decrease in commodity </span><span>prices could have a significant negative impact on all aspects of the economy in the </span><span>region. Middle Eastern economies may be subject to acts of terrorism, political strife, </span><span>religious, ethnic or socioeconomic unrest and sudden outbreaks of hostilities with </span><span>neighboring countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern </span><span>countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, </span><span>religious tensions or defense concerns, which may adversely affect the economies of </span><span>these countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant </span><span>unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many Middle Eastern countries periodically have experienced political, economic and </span><span>social unrest as protestors have called for widespread reform. Some of these protests </span><span>have resulted in a governmental regime change, internal conflict or civil war. If further </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regime changes were to occur, internal conflict were to intensify, or a civil war were to </span><span>continue in any of these countries, such instability could adversely affect the </span><span>economies of Middle Eastern countries in which the Fund invests and could decrease </span><span>the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-Diversification Risk.</span><span> The Fund is classified as </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified.</span><span>”</span><span> This means that, </span><span>compared with other funds that are classified as </span><span>“</span><span>diversified,</span><span>”</span><span> the Fund may invest a </span><span>greater percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number </span><span>of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to the risks associated with </span><span>these particular issuers or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence </span><span>affecting these issuers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies </span><span>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth </span><span>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency</span><span> and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or </span><span>governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less </span><span>liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the </span><span>value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the </span><span>issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Fund will invest in privately issued securities, </span><span>including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S </span><span>under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of </span><span>purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of </span><span>time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there </span><span>may be relatively few potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse </span><span>market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial </span><span>condition of the issuer, the Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when </span><span>it may be advisable to do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices </span><span>lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also may be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing </span><span>the Fund’s NAV due to the absence of an active trading market. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased </span><span>will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and its value may decline </span><span>as a result.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have </span><span>begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized </span><span>companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that </span><span>have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have </span><span>suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a </span><span>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, </span><span>due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </span><span>losses will not recur.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> Economies in emerging market countries </span><span>generally are heavily dependent upon commodity prices and international trade and, </span><span>accordingly, have been and may continue to be affected adversely by the economies of </span><span>their trading partners, trade barriers, exchange controls, and managed adjustments in </span><span>relative currency values, and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or </span><span>inflation rates. These countries may be subject to other protectionist measures </span><span>imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade, including the imposition </span><span>of tariffs by the U.S. or other importing countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including </span><span>variable interest entities associated with an underlying Chinese operating company) </span><span>subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a </span><span>considerable degree of economic, political and social instability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically </span><span>used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic </span><span>liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China </span><span>continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and </span><span>religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in </span><span>China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility,</span><span> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of </span><span>internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social </span><span>developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing </span><span>income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also </span><span>are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented </span><span>significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign </span><span>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop </span><span>market mechanisms. However, government control over certain sectors or enterprises </span><span>and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including </span><span>restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to </span><span>particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. </span><span>Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. </span><span>Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market </span><span>sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the </span><span>Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, </span><span>volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack </span><span>of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese issuers, </span><span>such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other </span><span>sectors are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their </span><span>operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy may be adversely affected by, among other </span><span>things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports or a contraction in </span><span>spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, which </span><span>would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and </span><span>widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. </span><span>China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize </span><span>official currency exchange rates. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, </span><span>institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers (including as a result of </span><span>heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </span><span>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key </span><span>trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and companies </span><span>in which the Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change from time to </span><span>time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the </span><span>U.S. or other governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns of </span><span>such government. For example, certain foreign technology companies are subject to </span><span>U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. </span><span>The U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain </span><span>Chinese companies due to concerns about forced labor. Such restrictions may have </span><span>unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any action </span><span>that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with </span><span>orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index </span><span>may include companies that are subject to economic or trade restrictions (but not </span><span>investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these </span><span>restrictions do not include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected </span><span>to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic </span><span>policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, </span><span>nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on </span><span>foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, </span><span>Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>concerns and other security concerns. Heightened tensions or an outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between China and Taiwan may adversely impact China’s economy as well as </span><span>the global economy and the value of the Fund’s investments. Additionally, China is </span><span>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign </span><span>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity </span><span>and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact </span><span>China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations </span><span>between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including </span><span>Tibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and </span><span>violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may </span><span>adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula </span><span>could adversely affect the Chinese economy. Such risks, among others, may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as </span><span>a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China under the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one country, two systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to maintain the current </span><span>capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the </span><span>continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on </span><span>the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese </span><span>government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control </span><span>over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social </span><span>framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to </span><span>the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in </span><span>Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, </span><span>the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) </span><span>the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong </span><span>economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what </span><span>effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the </span><span>Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the </span><span>establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the </span><span>Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese issuers are not subject to the same </span><span>degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as </span><span>issuers in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be </span><span>significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or </span><span>litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The </span><span>Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor </span><span>protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are </span><span>subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in </span><span>more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater </span><span>market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, social, political or </span><span>economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically </span><span>found in more developed markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience economic instability, </span><span>including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant </span><span>devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative </span><span>effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these </span><span>countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious </span><span>and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence </span><span>and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may invest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of </span><span>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in </span><span>more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which </span><span>the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often </span><span>have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of </span><span>securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and </span><span>does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such </span><span>measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging </span><span>market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts </span><span>of foreign trade and investment. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of </span><span>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, </span><span>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed </span><span>and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, </span><span>significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. </span><span>Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its </span><span>portfolio securities and could have an adverse effect on the Fund in seeking to achieve </span><span>its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There could be additional impacts on the value of the Fund as a result of sustainability </span><span>risks, in particular those caused by environmental changes related to climate change, </span><span>social issues (including relating to labor rights) and governance risk (including but not </span><span>limited to risks around board independence, ownership and control, or audit and tax </span><span>management). Additionally, disclosures or third-party data coverage associated with </span><span>sustainability risks is generally less available or transparent in these markets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain </span><span>emerging market countries. As a result, investments in certain countries in which the </span><span>Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of </span><span>assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and </span><span>repatriation of capital.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Frontier Markets.</span><span> Frontier markets are those emerging markets </span><span>considered to be among the smallest, least mature and the securities of the issuers of </span><span>which are the least liquid. Investments in frontier markets generally are subject to a </span><span>greater risk of loss than investments in developed markets or traditional emerging </span><span>markets. This is due to, among other things, smaller economies, less developed capital </span><span>markets, greater market volatility, lower trading volume, political and economic </span><span>instability, greater risk of a market shutdown, capital controls, delays or limits on </span><span>repatriation of local currency, insolvency of local governments, and more governmental </span><span>limitations on foreign investments than typically found in more developed markets. </span><span>Frontier markets are even more prone to economic shocks associated with political </span><span>and economic risks than are emerging markets generally. Many frontier market </span><span>countries may be dependent on commodities, foreign trade or foreign aid. As a result, </span><span>those risks traditionally associated with investments in emerging markets may be more </span><span>pronounced with respect to investments in frontier market economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia.</span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) </span><span>to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could </span><span>be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could </span><span>materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Saudi </span><span>Arabian government places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian </span><span>issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on the Fund’s ownership of any </span><span>single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent the Fund </span><span>from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </span><span>the Underlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of </span><span>petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its </span><span>economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market </span><span>for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be </span><span>significantly impacted. Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of </span><span>Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. </span><span>Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged </span><span>significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an </span><span>ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that </span><span>Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically </span><span>experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other </span><span>countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the </span><span>future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which </span><span>could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of securities in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi </span><span>Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of </span><span>the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s </span><span>economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this </span><span>labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically </span><span>associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that </span><span>may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on </span><span>and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political </span><span>instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental </span><span>decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </span><span>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely </span><span>stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains </span><span>the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </span><span>the economy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has </span><span>caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest </span><span>in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk. </span><span>Some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced </span><span>acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations </span><span>may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic areas and may adversely </span><span>affect their economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk.</span><span> An investment in sovereign or </span><span>quasi-sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt </span><span>obligations. Sovereign debt includes securities issued by or guaranteed by a foreign </span><span>sovereign government, and quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued by or </span><span>guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. The </span><span>issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or </span><span>unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited </span><span>recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of a sovereign debt </span><span>obligation to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of </span><span>sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations and may </span><span>affect the Fund's NAV. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and </span><span>less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. In the past, certain emerging market </span><span>countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld </span><span>payments of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal </span><span>and interest on their sovereign debts. Several countries in which the Fund invests have </span><span>defaulted on their sovereign debt obligations in the past or encountered downgrades of </span><span>their sovereign debt obligations, and those countries (or other countries) may default </span><span>or risk further downgrades in the future.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the </span><span>requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried </span><span>out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with </span><span>various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may </span><span>be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH </span><span>SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE </span><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK </span><span>SUCH INDICES.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Economic Risk.</span><span> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, </span><span>trading partner of, or foreign investor in, certain countries in which the Fund invests. As </span><span>a result, economic conditions of such countries may be particularly affected by </span><span>changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and </span><span>financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </span><span>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions </span><span>of such countries and, as a result, securities to which the Fund has exposure. </span><span>Circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or </span><span>principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such </span><span>non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy </span><span>and the global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other </span><span>asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the </span><span>value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade </span><span>in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a </span><span>result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund </span><span>is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher </span><span>redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the securities not been fair </span><span>valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments </span><span>may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party</span><span> service providers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>African Economic Risk.</span><span> Investing in the economies of African countries involves risks </span><span>not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed </span><span>economies, countries or geographic regions that may negatively affect the value of </span><span>investments in the Fund. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation </span><span>and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government intervention in </span><span>international trade, confiscatory taxation, imposition of capital controls and delays or </span><span>limits on repatriation of local currency, political instability, including authoritarian and/or</span><span> military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, civil war, and </span><span>social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest or </span><span>widespread outbreaks of disease.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The securities markets in Africa are underdeveloped and are often considered to be </span><span>less correlated to global economic cycles than markets located in more developed </span><span>economies, countries or geographic regions. Securities markets in African countries </span><span>are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market </span><span>capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, </span><span>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control and </span><span>heavy regulation of labor and industry. Moreover, trading on African securities markets </span><span>may be suspended altogether.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain governments in African countries may restrict or control to varying degrees the </span><span>ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in </span><span>those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa may require governmental </span><span>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors; may limit the </span><span>amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer; may </span><span>limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have </span><span>less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors </span><span>of those countries; and/or may impose additional taxes on foreign investors. These </span><span>factors, among others, make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in </span><span>Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more </span><span>developed countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span><span>The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy </span><span>sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: changes in and volatility of </span><span>global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and spending on exploration and </span><span>production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and </span><span>tax treatment; changes in the actual or perceived availability of oil or other resource </span><span>deposits; the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions or import controls; war or </span><span>other geopolitical conflicts; negative perception; increased litigation; energy </span><span>conservation efforts; energy infrastructure developments or service failures; and </span><span>increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be </span><span>subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may </span><span>increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A </span><span>significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively </span><span>small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, </span><span>governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock </span><span>prices of companies in this sector.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in transactions involving, countries </span><span>that have less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, confiscation </span><span>of assets, foreign investment restrictions, nationalization or other adverse policies or </span><span>that are at greater risk of political and social unrest, coups or labor disruptions. Energy </span><span>companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or </span><span>loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment </span><span>malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber </span><span>incident, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious </span><span>consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an </span><span>adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy </span><span>companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other </span><span>companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or </span><span>in the global economy. Energy production companies, especially those for oil and gas, </span><span>may also have to contend with service disruptions, pipeline and equipment leaks and </span><span>ruptures, explosions, fires, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, </span><span>discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous gases and other environmental risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s </span><span>large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 led to disruptions and increased </span><span>volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential </span><span>disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural </span><span>gas. The U.S. and other actors have, in response, enacted various sanctions and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions on imports of </span><span>oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as </span><span>the extent and duration of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and </span><span>associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and </span><span>depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments </span><span>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by </span><span>agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by </span><span>these foreign government agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally </span><span>backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds </span><span>and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. </span><span>Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a </span><span>particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually </span><span>provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the </span><span>performance of the Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations </span><span>and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other </span><span>policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government </span><span>may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, </span><span>the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </span><span>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S.</span><span> agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial </span><span>reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries, and </span><span>potential restrictions of the flow of international capital.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilities Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in exchange rates, domestic and international competition, and governmental </span><span>limitations on rates charged to consumers. The value of regulated utility debt securities </span><span>(and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the </span><span>movement of interest rates. Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater </span><span>competition and may adversely affect their profitability. Federal legislation may </span><span>facilitate the construction of electric transmission lines not only by public utilities but </span><span>also by independent transmission developers, which could increase competition in the </span><span>wholesale electricity markets. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify </span><span>outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business, utility </span><span>companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate </span><span>restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these </span><span>companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities industry may have </span><span>difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing </span><span>large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; </span><span>face restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to </span><span>environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or </span><span>products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made or </span><span>natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for </span><span>utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control </span><span>utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, </span><span>regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that </span><span>regulatory authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will </span><span>be adequate to permit the payment of coupon payments on bonds issued by such </span><span>company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a </span><span>significant adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust). Operating expenses paid </span><span>by BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired fund fees and </span><span>expenses, if any.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from </span><span>the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, net of any applicable </span><span>waivers, at the annual rate of 0.18%.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee so that the </span><span>Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after the fee waiver will not exceed 0.18% </span><span>through February 28, 2029. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to </span><span>February 28, 2029 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.

Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any </span><span>time.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BFA has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with the Sub-Adviser, an affiliate of </span><span>BFA, under which BFA pays the Sub-Adviser for services it provides either: (i) a fee </span><span>equal to a percentage of the management fee paid to BFA under the Investment </span><span>Advisory Agreement or (ii) an amount based on the cost of the services provided. The </span><span>Sub-Adviser, subject to the supervision and oversight of the Trust's Board of Trustees </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Board</span><span>”</span><span>) and BFA, is primarily responsible for the execution of securities </span><span>transactions outside the U.S. and Canada and may, from time to time, participate in </span><span>the management of specified assets in the Fund’s portfolio. If the Sub-Adviser provides </span><span>services relating to both portfolio management and trading, it is entitled to receive </span><span>from BFA an amount equal to 20% of BFA’s management fee, and if the Sub-Adviser </span><span>provides services related solely to trading, then it is entitled to receive from BFA an </span><span>amount equal to 110% of the actual pre-tax costs incurred by the Sub-Adviser.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned</span><span> subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>). As of December 31, 2023, BFA and </span><span>its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets of approximately $10.0 </span><span>trillion. BIL is an investment adviser located in the U.K. at Exchange Place One, 1 </span><span>Semple Street, Edinburgh EH3 8BL, Scotland 011 44 131 472 7200. The Sub-Adviser </span><span>is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in 1999. </span><span>BFA, the Sub-Adviser, and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the </span><span>actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may </span><span>affect the price of such securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board of the Investment </span><span>Advisory Agreement with BFA</span><span> </span><span>and the Sub-Advisory Agreement between BFA and the </span><span>Sub-Adviser is available in the Fund's Semi-Annual Report for the period ended April </span><span>30.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers.</span><span> James Mauro and Karen Uyehara are primarily responsible for </span><span>the day-to-day management of the Fund.

JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. serves as custodian for the Fund in connection with certain </span><span>securities lending activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts of Interest. </span><span>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including </span><span>BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Affiliates</span><span>”</span><span>)), and their respective </span><span>directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own </span><span>accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund based on the returns earned </span><span>on the Fund’s lending activities, including investment of the cash received as collateral </span><span>for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities </span><span>to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will </span><span>retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized Participants </span><span>on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF </span><span>Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank </span><span>may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or </span><span>funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>BEMB.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the </span><span>Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term </span><span>capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have </span><span>held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of </span><span>15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income </span><span>exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% </span><span>U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with </span><span>incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates </span><span>and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the </span><span>year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated </span><span>as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div> <div><span>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your </span><span>Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.

The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>39</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.
