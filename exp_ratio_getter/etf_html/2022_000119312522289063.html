Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices</div> <div></div> <hr/> <div>in less developed markets may make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</div> <div><span>Mid‑Capitalization Companies Risk.</span> Stock prices of mid‑capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid‑capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid‑capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid‑capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</div> <div><span>Privatization Risk.</span> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust</div> <div></div> <hr/> <div>quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to re‑nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found in more developed markets. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often have less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</div> <div>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts of foreign trade and investment. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause the Fund to miss attractive investment opportunities.</div> <div>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain emerging market countries.</div> <div><span>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span> Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and,</div> <div></div> <hr/> <div>therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by mid‑ or large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of mid‑ or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of mid‑ or large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</div> <div><span></span><span><span>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” </span></span></div> <div>The section entitled “Asian Economic Risk” on page 21 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The section entitled “Communication Services Sector Risk” on pages 21‑23 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The section entitled “Custody Risk” on page 23 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The section entitled “Industrials Sector Risk” on pages 23-24 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The section entitled “Privatization Risk” on page 24 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The section entitled “Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets” on pages 24‑25 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The following sections are added to the section “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” of the Prospectus:</div> <div><span><span>Information Technology Sector Risk.</span></span> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and</div> <div></div> <hr/> <div>intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the information technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the application software industry, in particular, may also be negatively affected by the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the systems software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in their products and services, which may result in individual or class action lawsuits, state or federal enforcement actions and other remediation costs.</div> <div><span>Materials Sector Risk.</span> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, decreases in the demand for materials, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims and may incur significant environmental remediation costs in complying with federal, state and local environmental laws. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</div> <div><span></span><span><span>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes” </span></span></div> <div>The section entitled “NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet<sup>®</sup> Global Autonomous Driving and Electric Vehicle Index<sup>TM</sup>” on pages 50‑51 of the SAI is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</div> <div>NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet<sup>®</sup> Global Autonomous Driving and Electric Vehicle Index</div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 53 </span></div> <div><span>Index Description.</span> The NYSE FactSet Global Autonomous Driving and Electric Vehicle Index (the “Underlying Index”), measures the performance of equity securities issued by companies that produce autonomous driving vehicles, electric vehicles, batteries for electric vehicles, or technologies related to such products.
