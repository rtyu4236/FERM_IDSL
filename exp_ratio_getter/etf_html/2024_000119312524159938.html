There can be no assurance that companies involved in AI will be able to successfully protect their intellectual property to prevent the misappropriation of their technology, or that competitors will not develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to such companies’ technology. Legal and regulatory changes, particularly related to information privacy and data protection, may have an impact on a company’s products or services. Companies engaged in artificial intelligence-related activities could face increasing regulatory scrutiny in the future, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the growth of companies that develop and/or utilize this technology. AI companies typically engage in significant amounts of spending on research and development, and there is no guarantee that the products or services produced by these companies will be successful. AI companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology.</div> <div>AI companies are potential targets for cyberattacks, which can have a materially adverse impact on the performance of these companies. In addition, the collection of data from consumers and other sources could face increased scrutiny as regulators consider how the data is collected, stored, safeguarded and used.

The eligible universe of securities in the Underlying Index includes the Parent Index, excluding companies in India or the People’s Republic of China and companies with average three-month trailing daily trading volume less than $2 million and float market capitalization of less than $300 million.</div> <div>The Index Provider scores companies in the eligible universe on a four-point thematic exposure scale based on exposure to at least one AI subtheme and then assigns each company to one of three tiers (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3). Morningstar considers each company’s role in the AI subtheme value chain, expected net profit increase from exposure to at least one AI subtheme and the portion of revenue expected to be derived from each AI subtheme over the next five years. Companies with a score of 2 or higher on the generative AI subtheme are assigned to Tier 1, and the rest are classified as either Tier 2 or Tier 3. All companies with a score of at least 2 across any one of the three other AI subthemes (i.e., Al data and infrastructure, Al services, or Al software) are assigned to Tier 2. Companies with an aggregate score of at least 3 across all four AI subthemes are also assigned to Tier 2. All remaining companies with a non‑zero score on at least one AI subtheme are assigned to Tier 3. The Index Provider then ranks the companies to emphasize thematic purity and exposure to the generative AI subtheme according to the following ranking criteria (in descending order):</div> <div> </div>

Additionally, the weight of any one Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 security, respectively, cannot exceed 6%, 3% and 3%, with the excess weight distributed proportionally within each Tier. If the aggregate weight of securities with a weight of at least 4.5% exceeds 22.5%, then Morningstar caps the weight of any one security at 6% and the sum of securities at 22.5%, with excess weight redistributed proportionally within each Tier.</div> <div>The Underlying Index is rebalanced quarterly on the third Friday of March, June and September (effective the following business day) and reconstituted and rebalanced annually following the third Friday of December (effective the following business day). To remain in the Underlying Index, current constituents must have an average three-month daily trading volume of at least $1.6 million and a free-float market capitalization of at least $240 million at the annual reconstitution.</div> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_5_e93082b2_e78e_9151_9c61_36e0e92e30eb_30"><ix:continuation continuedat="t_6_6a8e47e4_8df2_1ab5_13ff_b9eba1ae4826_30"><div>If you have any questions, please call 1‑800‑iShares (1‑800‑474‑2737).</div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_5_e93082b2_e78e_9151_9c61_36e0e92e30eb_31"><ix:continuation continuedat="t_6_6a8e47e4_8df2_1ab5_13ff_b9eba1ae4826_31"><div> </div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation> <ix:continuation><ix:continuation><div>iShares<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.</div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation> <div>IS‑A‑SUPP‑IRBO‑0624</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT</div> <div>FOR FUTURE REFERENCE</div> </div> </body></html>
