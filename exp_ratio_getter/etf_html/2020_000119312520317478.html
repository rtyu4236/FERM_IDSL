obtaining shareholder approval to be managed as a <font>non-diversified</font> fund, the Fund will seek to track the investment results of the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US <font>Large-Mid</font> Cap Broad Growth Index</font><font size="1"><sup>SM</sup></font><font size="2"> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of stocks issued by
<font>large-mid</font> capitalization companies that have exhibited above-average “growth” characteristics as determined by Morningstar, Inc.’s (“Morningstar” or the “Index Provider”)
proprietary index methodology. Underlying Index constituents are drawn from the pool of stocks issued by U.S. based companies that trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NYSE Amex Equities or The NASDAQ Stock Market.
The Morningstar index methodology defines <font>“large-mid</font> capitalization” stocks as those stocks that form approximately the top 90% of the market capitalization of the stocks eligible to be included in
the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Market Extended Index</font><font size="1"><sup>SM</sup></font><font size="2"> (a diversified broad market index that represents approximately 99.5% of the market capitalization of publicly-traded U.S.
stocks and includes only those stocks in the top 75% of companies in the investable universe based on liquidity score). The Index Provider then designates stocks as “blend,” “growth” or “value” based on their style
orientations. The stocks in the Underlying Index are designated as “growth” because they are issued by companies that typically have higher than average historical and forecasted earnings, sales, equity and cash flow growth. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The stocks in the Underlying Index are weighted according to the total value of shares that are publicly owned and available for trading. As of

than March 19, 2021. In addition, if the Fund is unable to obtain shareholder approval in a timely manner, the Fund may track the Interim Underlying Index on an interim basis. The index methodology of the Interim Underlying Index is
substantially similar to that of the New Underlying Index except that the Interim Underlying Index employees a capping methodology to limit the weights of some issuers in the index. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i><u>Change in the Fund’s “Summary of Principal Risks</u>” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The following shall be added

the Morningstar US Style Index family, which is based on the same methodology as the well-known Morningstar Style Box<font size="1"><sup>™</sup></font>.
The Morningstar Style Box<font size="1"><sup>™</sup></font> classification of each stock relies on prospective financial performance metrics –
expressed as a yield (i.e., revenue yield, cash flow yield, dividend yield, and book value yield) and the per-share growth rate of each such metric – as derived from Morningstar’s proprietary models, and (when available) the Institutional
Brokers Estimate System (“IBES”) forecast of each stock’s current year earnings per share and the IBES median long-term earnings growth forecast. The Morningstar Indexes are governed by transparent, objective rules for security
selection, exclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for corporate actions. Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar”) makes no subjective determinations related to index composition. </font></p>
