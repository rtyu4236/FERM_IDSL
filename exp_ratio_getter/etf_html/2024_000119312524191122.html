An investor may incur costs </span><span>attributable to the difference between </span><span>the highest price a buyer is willing to </span><span>pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) </span><span>and the lowest price a seller is willing to </span><span>accept for shares of the Fund (ask) </span><span>when buying or selling shares in the </span><span>secondary market (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid-ask </span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Information</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund intends to make distributions </span><span>that may be taxable to you as ordinary </span><span>income or capital gains, unless you are </span><span>investing through a tax-deferred </span><span>arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or </span><span>an IRA, in which case, your distributions </span><span>generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Payments to Broker-Dealers </span><span>and Other Financial </span><span>Intermediaries</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you purchase shares of the Fund </span><span>through a broker-dealer or other </span><span>financial intermediary (such as a bank), </span><span>BFA or other related companies may </span><span>pay the intermediary for marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational </span><span>training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms </span><span>and reporting systems or other services </span><span>related to the sale or promotion of the </span><span>Fund. These payments may create a </span><span>conflict of interest by influencing the </span><span>broker-dealer or other intermediary and </span><span>your salesperson to recommend the </span><span>Fund over another investment. Ask your </span><span>salesperson or visit your financial </span><span>intermediary’s website for more </span><span>information.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>S-12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>More Information About the Fund</span></div> <div> <div><span>This Prospectus contains important information about investing in the Fund. Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>NYSE Arca, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE Arca</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may be </span><span>different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency </span><span>purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or </span><span>other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its </span><span>portfolio.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities and other assets in the Fund’s portfolio or its </span><span>Underlying Index may underperform in comparison to</span><span> </span><span>other indexes that track, or </span><span>assets that represent, other countries or geographic units, industries, markets, market </span><span>segments, or asset classes. Various types of securities, other assets and indexes may </span><span>experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to financial </span><span>markets generally. This divergence may be due to a number of factors including, </span><span>among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local </span><span>products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the </span><span>Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. There are a </span><span>limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants for the Fund, </span><span>including on an agency basis on behalf of other market participants. No Authorized </span><span>Participant is obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. To the extent </span><span>that Authorized Participants exit the business or do not place creation or redemption </span><span>orders for the Fund and no other Authorized Participant places orders, Fund shares are </span><span>more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or </span><span>delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for a Fund that </span><span>invests in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or instruments with lower trading </span><span>volume. Such assets often entail greater settlement and operational complexity and </span><span>higher capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the number of </span><span>Authorized Participants that engage with the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund’s investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities or other assets of one or more issuers, countries or other geographic </span><span>units, markets, industries, project types, or asset classes. A Fund with investment </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>concentration may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those </span><span>assets, may experience greater price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory impacts on those assets compared to a fund </span><span>that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Currency Risk.</span><span> Because the Fund’s NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, </span><span>investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund </span><span>invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on </span><span>repatriation of foreign currency, even if the foreign currency value of the Fund’s </span><span>holdings in that market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and </span><span>can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly </span><span>and without warning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs in connection with </span><span>conversions between U.S. dollars and foreign currencies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund and entities that interact with the Fund are susceptible </span><span>to operational, information security and related cybersecurity risks, both directly and </span><span>through their service providers. These entities include, but are not limited to, the </span><span>Fund’s adviser, distributor, other service providers (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., index and benchmark </span><span>providers, accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), </span><span>counterparties, market makers, Authorized Participants, listing exchanges, other </span><span>financial market operators, and governmental authorities. Cybersecurity risks are also </span><span>present for issuers of securities or other assets in which the Fund invests, which could </span><span>result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s </span><span>investment in such issuers to lose value. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate </span><span>attacks or unintentional events. They include, but are not limited to, gaining </span><span>unauthorized access to systems, misappropriating assets or sensitive information, </span><span>corrupting or destroying data, and causing operational disruption. Geopolitical tensions </span><span>may increase the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from </span><span>nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions and impact business operations and </span><span>may result in any of the following: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability </span><span>to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential information, impediments to trading, </span><span>submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the </span><span>inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of </span><span>applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, </span><span>reimbursement or other compensation costs, and other legal and compliance </span><span>expenses. In addition, cyber incidents may render records of Fund assets and </span><span>transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the </span><span>Fund’s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may incur </span><span>substantial costs in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk </span><span>management systems to prevent, cyber incidents. However, there are inherent </span><span>limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have </span><span>not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or </span><span>that cyber incidents will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the </span><span>cybersecurity plans and systems of its service providers, counterparties, and other </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>third parties whose activities affect the Fund. The Fund and its shareholders could be </span><span>negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk </span><span>that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform other types of </span><span>stocks or the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not </span><span>required to pay or continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers </span><span>of dividend-paying stocks will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or </span><span>eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated </span><span>accelerations or increases in the payment of dividends), which may adversely affect a </span><span>Fund with such holdings. In addition, the value of dividend-paying stocks can decline </span><span>when interest rates rise, as fixed-income investments become more attractive to </span><span>investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> Equity securities are subject to changes in value due to </span><span>general market or economic conditions, perceptions about the markets in which </span><span>issuers participate or a number of factors relating to a specific issuer. Investments in </span><span>equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. Equity </span><span>securities (both common and preferred stock) are subordinated to debt securities in a </span><span>company’s capital structure, and so equity holders are generally subject to more risks, </span><span>particularly in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy. Common stock has the lowest </span><span>priority and the greatest risks, including with respect to dividends and any liquidation </span><span>payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the U.K.'s economy may be affected by global economic, industrial and </span><span>financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU </span><span>regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency </span><span>of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its </span><span>sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a </span><span>significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their </span><span>trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced </span><span>volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or </span><span>government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of its Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or its </span><span>agents will construct or calculate the Underlying Index accurately. While the Index </span><span>Provider describes what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index </span><span>Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability regarding the </span><span>quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they </span><span>do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s </span><span>methodology. BFA also does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index </span><span>Provider’s or any agent’s errors.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Index Provider may rely on various sources of information to assess the criteria of </span><span>components of the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on </span><span>assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the </span><span>Index Provider’s methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate </span><span>assessment of included components. Errors in index data, index computations or the </span><span>construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur, </span><span>and the Index Provider may not identify or correct them promptly or at all, particularly </span><span>for indexes that are less commonly used as benchmarks. In addition, there may be </span><span>heightened risks associated with the adequacy and reliability of information about </span><span>emerging markets constituents, as such markets may have less information available </span><span>or less regulatory oversight. Errors related to the Underlying Index may negatively or </span><span>positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, if the Underlying Index </span><span>contains incorrect constituents, the Fund will have exposure to such constituents and </span><span>will be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from the Index Provider’s errors will be kept by the </span><span>Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs from such errors will be borne by the </span><span>Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. If a scheduled rebalance is postponed, index constituents that </span><span>would otherwise be removed at the rebalance (due to, for example, changes in market </span><span>capitalization or issuer credit ratings) may remain, causing the performance and </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those expected under normal </span><span>conditions. In addition, to the extent circumstances evolve between periodic index </span><span>reviews and reconstitutions, the Underlying Index may include constituents that do not </span><span>align with its objective or selection criteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying Index </span><span>may be similarly affected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out ad </span><span>hoc index rebalances due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market </span><span>conditions, corporate events, or corrections of errors. The Fund will in turn rebalance </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index. The Fund and its shareholders will directly bear any transaction costs </span><span>and market exposure from such portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-related errors </span><span>and ad hoc rebalances may increase the Fund’s costs and tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of a Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities or other assets to which the Fund has exposure. The value of securities or </span><span>other assets may decline, or perform differently from the market as a whole, due to </span><span>changes in the financial condition or credit rating of the issuer or counterparty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller-capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions and </span><span>competitive challenges. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and </span><span>subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller-capitalization </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>companies. The performance of large-capitalization companies could trail the overall </span><span>performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders of the </span><span>Fund, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser, an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may hold their investment in </span><span>the Fund for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge or loan Fund </span><span>shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares becoming </span><span>concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder </span><span>or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that the size of </span><span>the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares may </span><span>adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. To the extent the Fund permits </span><span>redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the Fund to sell portfolio securities </span><span>or other assets when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the </span><span>Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of Fund shares, increase the </span><span>Fund’s brokerage costs, accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital </span><span>gains, and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier than </span><span>the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming</span><span> shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable </span><span>distribution during or with respect to such tax year. The Fund also may be required to </span><span>sell its more liquid investments to meet a large redemption, in which case the Fund’s </span><span>remaining assets may be less liquid, more volatile, and more difficult to price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent these large shareholders transact in Fund shares on the secondary </span><span>market, such transactions may account for a large percentage of the trading volume </span><span>for Fund shares and may, therefore, have a material upward or downward effect on the </span><span>market price of the shares. In addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely </span><span>affect the Fund’s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new </span><span>cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting </span><span>its investment returns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>The Fund is not actively managed and invests in securities or </span><span>other assets included in, or representative of, its Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. The Fund may be affected by a general decline in market segments </span><span>related to its Underlying Index, and BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund’s </span><span>assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. </span><span>Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the </span><span>Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track its </span><span>Underlying Index. Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the </span><span>Fund will not fully replicate its Underlying Index and may hold securities or other assets </span><span>not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that </span><span>BFA’s investment strategy, whose implementation is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results. There is no guarantee that the </span><span>Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of its </span><span>Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries or other geographic units, markets, industries, or </span><span>asset classes. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>pandemics or other public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a </span><span>sovereign default or other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant </span><span>impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or </span><span>discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Changes in market and economic conditions generally do </span><span>not have the same impact on all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk. </span><span>The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, any of which </span><span>may lead to its shares trading in the secondary market at a premium or discount to </span><span>NAV or to the intraday value of the Fund’s portfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at </span><span>a time when the market price is at a premium to NAV or sell Fund shares at a time </span><span>when the market price is at a discount to the NAV, you may pay significantly more or </span><span>receive significantly less than the underlying value of the Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of an Active Primary Market.</span><span> Although Fund shares are listed for trading on </span><span>one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active primary trading </span><span>market for Fund shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Listing Risks. </span><span>The Fund’s shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund’s primary </span><span>listing is maintained. Fund shares also may be available to non-U.S. investors through </span><span>funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no </span><span>assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or </span><span>in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for </span><span>exchange listing or market trading. The Fund’s shares may be less actively traded in </span><span>certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and </span><span>settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct </span><span>their trades for execution. Certain information that is available to investors who trade </span><span>Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be </span><span>available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary </span><span>market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to create or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts to NAV than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts creation </span><span>and redemption orders. Securities held by the Fund may be traded in markets that </span><span>close at a different time than an exchange on which Fund shares are traded. Liquidity </span><span>in those securities may be reduced after the applicable closing time. As a result, during </span><span>the time when the exchange is open but after the applicable market closing, fixing or </span><span>settlement time, there may be wider bid/ask spreads on the exchange and a greater </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In stressed market conditions, the market for the Fund’s shares may become less </span><span>liquid in response to deteriorating liquidity in the markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>holdings, and an investor may be unable to sell their Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In times of extraordinary market volatility, </span><span>Fund shares may be subject to trading halts pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules of a </span><span>stock exchange or market. If there is a trading halt or unanticipated closure of an </span><span>exchange or market, an investor may be unable to purchase or sell Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, if trading in certain securities or financial instruments is restricted, this may </span><span>disrupt the Fund’s creation/redemption process, affect the price at which Fund shares </span><span>trade in the secondary market, and result in the Fund being unable to trade certain </span><span>securities or financial instruments. In such circumstances, the Fund may be unable to </span><span>rebalance its portfolio or accurately price its portfolio holdings and may incur </span><span>substantial trading losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund Shares May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV</span><span>. Shares of the Fund trade on stock </span><span>exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The Fund’s NAV is </span><span>calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market </span><span>value of the Fund’s portfolio holdings. The trading price of the Fund’s shares fluctuates </span><span>throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares </span><span>and the underlying value of the Fund’s portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading </span><span>prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during times of market </span><span>volatility, significant redemption requests, or other unusual market conditions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, because Fund shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, </span><span>BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the Fund’s NAV are not likely to be </span><span>sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which </span><span>frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their </span><span>NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that </span><span>the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s </span><span>next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the </span><span>Fund’s NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In </span><span>addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of </span><span>significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that </span><span>differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or </span><span>redeem the Fund’s shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or the </span><span>Fund’s underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling Fund shares through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission and </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) </span><span>and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> price). The spread </span><span>varies over time for Fund shares based on trading volume and market liquidity. It is </span><span>generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider </span><span>if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. Increased market volatility </span><span>also may cause wider spreads. In addition, there may be regulatory and other charges </span><span>that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying </span><span>or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment </span><span>results, and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who </span><span>anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</span></div> <div> <div><span>National Closed Market Trading Risk.</span><span> To the extent that securities or other assets </span><span>held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed </span><span>when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely </span><span>to be deviations between such asset’s current price and its last quoted price (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the </span><span>quote from the closed foreign market to the Fund). The impact of a closed foreign </span><span>market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s holdings </span><span>trade on a closed foreign market or when a foreign market is closed for unscheduled </span><span>reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that </span><span>may be greater than those experienced by other funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.</span><span> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are </span><span>subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, </span><span>including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused </span><span>by economic and political developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, </span><span>the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed </span><span>below:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Government intervention in issuers' operations or structure;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>A lack of market liquidity and market efficiency;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Greater securities price volatility;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Less availability of public information about issuers;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Limitations on foreign ownership of securities;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of withholding or other taxes;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of the funds or other assets of the </span><span>Fund;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Higher transaction and custody costs and delays in settlement procedures;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Lower levels of regulation of the securities markets;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Weaker accounting, disclosure and reporting requirements and the risk of being </span><span>delisted from U.S. exchanges; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Legal principles relating to corporate governance, directors’ fiduciary duties and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>liabilities and stockholders’ rights in markets in which the Fund invests may differ </span><span>from or may not be as extensive or protective as those that apply in the U.S.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Withholding Tax Reclaims Risk</span><span>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on </span><span>dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where </span><span>such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund will receive a </span><span>withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such </span><span>countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous </span><span>assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund generally includes accruals </span><span>for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential </span><span>impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially </span><span>decreases, for example due to a change in tax regulation or approach, accruals in the </span><span>Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will </span><span>adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written </span><span>down will bear the impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they </span><span>were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund </span><span>that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is </span><span>successful will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who </span><span>sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>will subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> Investing in U.S. issuers involves legal, regulatory, </span><span>political, currency, security, and economic risks that are specific to the U.S. A </span><span>decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations, inflation, an economic </span><span>recession, financial system stress, or political turmoil, among other risks, may have an </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The </span><span>U.S. is also subject to the risk of natural disasters, such as droughts, earthquakes, fires </span><span>and floods. U.S. security risks include acts of terrorism, internal unrest and a </span><span>deterioration in relations between the U.S. and certain countries. Any of these may </span><span>adversely affect the U.S. economy, financial markets or issuers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will maintain elevated public debt levels </span><span>for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or </span><span>cause economic problems, the costs of servicing such debt may constrain future </span><span>economic growth. Circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of </span><span>interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt </span><span>ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the </span><span>U.S. economy and the global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk. </span><span>Some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced </span><span>acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations </span><span>may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic areas and may adversely </span><span>affect their economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest </span><span>received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements </span><span>to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize </span><span>the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, </span><span>changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be </span><span>heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences </span><span>between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and </span><span>determining the Fund’s NAV.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilities Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in exchange rates, domestic and international competition, and governmental </span><span>limitations on rates charged to consumers. The value of regulated utility debt securities </span><span>(and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the </span><span>movement of interest rates. Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater </span><span>competition and may adversely affect their profitability. Federal legislation may </span><span>facilitate the construction of electric transmission lines not only by public utilities but </span><span>also by independent transmission developers, which could increase competition in the </span><span>wholesale electricity markets. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify </span><span>outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business, utility </span><span>companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate </span><span>restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these </span><span>companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities industry may have </span><span>difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing </span><span>large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; </span><span>face restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to </span><span>environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or </span><span>products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to </span><span>increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made or </span><span>natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for </span><span>utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control </span><span>utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, </span><span>regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that </span><span>regulatory authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will </span><span>be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks issued by a utility company. </span><span>Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a significant adverse </span><span>impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price that the Fund could receive upon the sale (or other </span><span>disposition) of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>security or other asset, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low </span><span>volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. The price </span><span>received by the Fund also may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index (if </span><span>applicable). Because non-U.S. exchanges or markets may be open on days or during </span><span>time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or </span><span>other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when </span><span>investors are not able to purchase or sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets </span><span>denominated in non-U.S. currencies (if any) is translated into U.S. dollars at the </span><span>prevailing market rates. This translation may result in a difference between the prices </span><span>used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, </span><span>in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants that create or redeem </span><span>Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities or other assets </span><span>may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they </span><span>would have received had the securities or other assets not been fair valued or been </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments may be </span><span>impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party </span><span>service providers.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk.</span><span> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in a Fund’s NAV and in the return </span><span>on its portfolio. A Fund that borrows will incur interest expenses and other fees, which </span><span>may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause a Fund to liquidate positions </span><span>when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit a Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, exercise rights or undertake business transactions may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to invest in </span><span>certain securities or other assets may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings. To the extent a Fund tracks an index, such limits may </span><span>increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested in an asset relative to its Underlying </span><span>Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, ownership limits may apply to securities whose issuers operate in certain </span><span>regulated industries or in certain international markets. Such limits also may apply </span><span>where the investing entity (such as the Fund) is subject to corporate or regulatory </span><span>ownership restrictions or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions. In </span><span>certain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-level amounts invested or voted by BFA </span><span>and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the </span><span>Fund) may not exceed the relevant limits without the grant of a license or other </span><span>regulatory or corporate consent. In other cases, exceeding such thresholds may cause </span><span>BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or </span><span>business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust). Operating expenses paid </span><span>by BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired fund fees and </span><span>expenses, if any.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from </span><span>the Fund corresponding to the Fund’s allocable portion of an aggregate management </span><span>fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares </span><span>funds: iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector </span><span>ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares </span><span>Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares </span><span>Global Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, </span><span>iShares Global Industrials ETF, iShares Global Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global </span><span>Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF, iShares Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF, iShares </span><span>Global Utilities ETF, iShares North American Natural Resources ETF, iShares </span><span>Semiconductor ETF, and iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF. The </span><span>aggregate management fee is calculated as follows: 0.4800% per annum of the </span><span>aggregate net assets less than or equal to $10.0 billion, plus 0.4300% per annum of </span><span>the aggregate net assets over $10.0 billion, up to and including $20.0 billion, plus </span><span>0.3800% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $20.0 billion, up to and including </span><span>$30.0 billion, plus 0.3420% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $30.0 billion, </span><span>up to and including $40.0 billion, plus 0.3078% per annum of the aggregate net assets </span><span>in excess of $40.0 billion.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of </span><span>0.41%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or </span><span>expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired </span><span>fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be </span><span>eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund based on the returns earned </span><span>on the Fund’s lending activities, including investment of the cash received as collateral </span><span>for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities </span><span>to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending </span><span>program.</span></div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>JXI.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE </span><span>Arca.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair </span><span>value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the </span><span>relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is </span><span>designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets </span><span>following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of </span><span>the Fund’s pricing time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein.

It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a real estate investment trust (</span><span>“</span><span>REIT</span><span>”</span><span>) and distributed to a shareholder generally </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning </span><span>after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends </span><span>eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. </span><span>shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, </span><span>reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</span></div> <div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use </span><span>foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out </span><span>pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when </span><span>aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and </span><span>redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More </span><span>information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.

Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance for the past five years.
