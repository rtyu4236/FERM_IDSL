<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet<sup>®</sup> Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Index (the “Underlying Index”),
which measures the performance of equity securities across multiple sectors, including information technology, communication, industrials, consumer discretionary and healthcare, issued by companies involved in robotics and artificial intelligence
activities (as determined by ICE Data Indices, LLC (the “Index Provider” or “IDI”)).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is composed of equity securities of
companies that are primarily listed in one of 43 developed or emerging market countries and that are the most involved in, or exposed to, (as determined by the Index Provider) one of the 22 robotics and artificial intelligence-related FactSet<sup>®</sup> Revere Business Industry Classification systems (“RBICS”) sub-industries. The Index Provider first conducts fundamental research to establish a universe of RBICS
sectors that participate in providing robotics and/or artificial intelligence products and services, and that universe is further refined to include only the most relevant RBICS sub-sectors (as determined by the Index Provider) related to robotics
and artificial intelligence activities (<font>e.g.</font>, semiconductor manufacturing, software, internet and data services). The companies within these sub-sectors</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>are then ranked based on the data and information in their public filings and
disclosures (<font>e.g.</font>, regulatory filings, earning transcripts, etc.) to arrive at the 22 most relevant RBICS sub-industries (as determined by RBICS) related to robotics and artificial intelligence activities, and
the Underlying Index includes the companies that either (1) derive 50% of their revenues, or (2) have at least a 20% market share, or generate $1 billion or more in absolute annual revenues, from one of the 22 RBICS sub-industries with exposure to a
robotics and artificial intelligence theme, as determined by the Index Provider. The Index Provider's methodology does not require that at least one company from each of the sub-industries be included in the Underlying Index. In addition, companies
included in the Underlying Index may also operate business lines that generate revenue in other industries.</div>
<div>To be included in the Underlying Index, companies must also
have a float-adjusted market capitalization of $500 million or greater, but existing constituents could remain in the Underlying Index if the company’s float-adjusted market capitalization is equal to or greater than $400 million. In addition,
companies must have a three month average daily trading value (“ADTV”) of $2 million or greater, but existing constituents could remain in the Underlying Index if the company’s three-month ADTV is equal to or greater than $1.5
million. The component securities of the Underlying Index are equally weighted.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index will be reviewed and reconstituted
annually in December each year. Constituent weights of the Underlying Index are rebalanced semi-annually.</div>
<div>As of July 31, 2022, the Underlying Index consisted of 113
issuers from the following 16 countries or regions:</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Australia, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan,
Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S. The Underlying Index includes large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies and may change over time. As of July 31, 2022, a
significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the communication services, industrials, information technology and semiconductor industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to
change over time.</div> <div>BFA uses a “passive” or
indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or
appear overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep
portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as
well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for
the purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is owned, maintained and administered by
the Index Provider, which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying
Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that
may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or
redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading
volumes.</div> <div>Communication Services Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the communications sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, obsolescence of
communications products and services due to technological advancement, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals and changing consumer tastes and interests.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause the</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This could cause the
Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced
liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund's NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by
the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the information technology sector are</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to
adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and actual or perceived
vulnerabilities in their products or services.</div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit
rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.<font> Certain shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time
to time own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of time. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their
investment. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares could</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>require the Fund to dispose of assets to meet the redemption requests, which
can accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming
shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively large proportion of its assets in cash in anticipation of large
redemptions, diluting its investment returns. These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s brokerage costs
and/or have a material effect on the market price of the Fund shares.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to
considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant
impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities
and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such
as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a
small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to<font>
Asian Economic Risk</font>.</div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks
associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have
experienced security concerns, such as war, terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the
Fund’s investments. In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory, currency and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves
risks associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. Governments in the U.S. and many other
countries have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate and banking entities. A number of jurisdictions may also institute broader sanctions on Russia. Recently, Russia has issued a number of countersanctions,
some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, dividends), and prohibit Russian persons from entering into
transactions with designated persons from “unfriendly states” as well as the export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The
extent and duration of the military</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including
declines in its stock markets and the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting
actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian
government, Russian companies, or Russian individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian companies in which the Fund invests. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets
for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors globally. Russian companies may be unable to pay dividends and, if they pay
dividends, the Fund may be unable to receive them. As a result of sanctions, the Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. It is
unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will resume.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence Risk.<font> Companies involved in, or exposed to, robotics and artificial intelligence-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. These companies face intense
competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend significantly on retaining and growing the consumer base of their respective products and services. Many of these companies are also reliant on the end-user demand of products
and services in various industries that may in part utilize robotics and artificial intelligence. Further, many companies involved in, or exposed to, robotics and artificial intelligence-related businesses (as determined by the Index Provider) may
be substantially exposed to the market and business risks of other industries or sectors, and the Fund may be adversely affected by negative developments impacting those companies, industries or sectors.</font></div>
<div>In addition, these companies are heavily dependent on
intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. There can be no assurance that companies involved in robotics and artificial intelligence will be able to successfully protect their intellectual
property to prevent the misappropriation of their technology, or that competitors will not develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to such companies’ technology. Legal and regulatory changes, particularly related
information privacy and data protection, may have an impact on a company’s products or services. Robotics and artificial intelligence companies typically engage in significant amounts</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>of spending on research and development, and there is no guarantee that the
products or services produced by these companies will be successful. Robotics and artificial intelligence companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Semiconductor Industry
Risk<font>.</font><font> Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Semiconductor companies typically face intense
competition, potentially rapid product obsolescence and high capital costs and are dependent on third-party suppliers and the availability of materials. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by
loss or impairment of those rights. Semiconductor companies are also affected by the economic performance of their customers.</font></div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In
addition, the securities of small-capitalization</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and
large-capitalization companies.</div> <div>Thematic Investing Risk.<font> The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the identification of securities for inclusion in the Underlying Index that reflect themes and sub-themes, and its performance may suffer if such securities
are not correctly identified or if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer if the stocks included in the Underlying Index do not benefit from the development of such themes or sub-themes. Performance may
also be impacted by the inclusion of non-theme-relevant exposures in the Underlying Index. There is no guarantee that the Underlying Index will reflect the theme and sub-theme exposures intended.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close
and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest
received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of
custom baskets, changes</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new
or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the
Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and determining the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or
for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who
purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a
different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Performance Information</div>
<div>The bar chart and table that follow show how the Fund has
performed on a calendar year basis and provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund’s average annual returns for 1 year and since inception compare with the Underlying Index. Both assume that all
dividends and distributions have been reinvested in the Fund. Past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. If BFA had not waived certain Fund fees during certain periods, the Fund's
returns would have been lower.</div> <div>Year by Year Returns<sup>1</sup> (Years Ended December 31)</div> <div>

table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
