<p><b></b><b><i>The information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, the Summary Prospectus, Prospectus and SAI for each Fund.
</i></b></p> <p>On June 15, 2022, the Board of Trustees of each Trust unanimously voted to close and liquidate the Funds. After the close of business on
August 22, 2022, the Funds will no longer accept creation orders. Trading in the Funds will be halted prior to market open on August 23, 2022. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on
August 25, 2022. </p> <p>When each Fund is in the process of liquidating its portfolio, which is anticipated to commence prior to August 23, 2022, the Fund will
hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and strategies and is likely to incur higher tracking error than is typical for the Fund. Furthermore, during the time between market open on
August 23, 2022 and August 25, 2022, because shares will not be traded on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your shares. </p>
<p>Shareholders may sell their holdings of a Fund on Cboe BZX until the market close on August 22, 2022 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions
associated with the sale of Fund shares. At the time the liquidation of a Fund is complete, shares of the Fund will be individually redeemed. If you still hold shares of a Fund on August 25, 2022, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares
for cash based on the net asset value as of the close of business on August 22, 2022, which will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date. </p>

<p>If you are subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of a Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A
sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, a Fund may declare taxable distributions of its investment income
and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss depending on your
tax basis. Please consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences. </p> <p>If you have any questions, please call <font><font>1-800-iShares</font></font> <font><font><font>(1-800-474-2737).</font></font></font> </p>
