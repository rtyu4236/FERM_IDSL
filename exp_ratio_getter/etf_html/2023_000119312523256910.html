</table> <p><b></b><b><i>Unless otherwise noted herein, all references to “iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF” in the
Summary Prospectus, Prospectus, and the SAI are deleted in their entirety and replaced with “iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF.” </i></b></p>
<p><b></b><b><i><u>Change to the Fund’s “Investment Objective</u>” </i></b></p>
<p><b>The section entitled “Investment Objective” of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus are deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></p>
<p>The iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of <font>US-listed</font> companies engaged in the owning, operating, developing, or providing of infrastructure for the storage, processing, transmission and/or access of digital data and services. </p>
<p><b></b><b><i><u>Change to the Fund’s “Principal Investment Strategies</u>” </i></b></p>
<p><b>The first paragraph of the section entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following: </b></p> <p>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index (the
“Underlying Index”), which measures </p>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
the performance of stocks of U.S.-listed companies, as well as U.S.-listed American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) of foreign companies from developed markets, involved in the ownership
and management of data centers, telecommunication towers, and related equipment, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”). </p>
<p>The Underlying Index is a subset of the S&amp;P Developed Broad Market Index and includes securities with a minimum float-adjusted market capitalization
(“FMC”) of $300 million, a three-month Median Daily Value Traded (“MDTV”) of $2 million and may include large-, <font>mid-</font> or small-capitalization companies. </p>
<p>The Index Provider selects index constituents using a tiered approach consisting of Tier 1a, Tier 1b, and Tier 2, based on a company’s FactSet Revere Business
Industry Classification System (“RBICS”) Focus Level 6 <font>sub-industry,</font> which defines each company’s primary line of business. The Index Provider selects companies which are classified within
17 <font>sub-industries,</font> which correspond with the following categories: Telecommunication Towers, Data Centers, Communications Equipment, Communications Semiconductors, and Data Storage Equipment. SPDJI classifies
Tier 1a and Tier 1b companies as those belonging to the <font>sub-industries</font> of the Telecommunication Towers and Data Centers categories, respectively. The Index Provider classifies Tier 2 companies as those
belonging to the <font>sub-industries</font> of the Communications Equipment, Communications Semiconductors and Data Storage Equipment categories. If there are 50 or more stocks classified as Tier 1a and Tier 1b, then all
of Tier 1a and Tier 1b stocks are selected for inclusion in the Underlying Index and the Index Provider does not look to Tier 2 companies. If less than 50 stocks are classified as Tier 1a and Tier 1b, the largest eligible Tier 2 stocks, determined
by the Index Provider according to the company’s FMC, are selected until the total stocks in the Underlying Index are capped at 50. The Index Provider requires the Tier 1a companies and Tier 1b companies, in aggregate, to have a minimum of 25%
weight for each tier. Tier 2 companies may comprise up to 45% of the overall weight of the Underlying Index. Individual Tier 1a and Tier 1b securities are capped at 10% and individual and Tier 2 securities are capped at 4.5%. Securities with weights
greater than 4.5% will not in aggregate exceed 45% of the Underlying Index weight at rebalance. The Underlying Index is reviewed annually in December and rebalanced quarterly in March, June, and September. </p>
<p>As of September 18, 2023, the Underlying Index had 29 securities and a significant portion of the index constituents were represented by securities of companies in
the Real Estate and Information Technology industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </p> <p><b>The section entitled
“S&amp;P North American Technology Multimedia Networking Index<sup>TM</sup>” on page 53 of the SAI is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></p>
<p><b>S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index </b></p>
<p><b><u>Number of Components: approximately 29 </u></b></p> <p><b>Index Description. </b>The

those belonging to the RBICS Focus Level 6 <font>sub-industries</font> of Tower Equity REITs and Wireless Infrastructure Services; Tier 1b companies as those belonging to the RBICS Focus Level 6 <font>sub-industries</font> of Data Center Equity REITs and Colocation and Data Center Services; and Tier 2 companies as those belonging to the following RBICS Focus Level 6
<font>sub-industries:</font> Cable Interconnect Components, Networking Semiconductors, Other Communications Semiconductors, General Communications Equipment, Other Wireless Equipment, Carrier Core (Backbone) Equipment,
Carrier Edge Network Management Equipment, General Carrier Edge (Access) Equipment, General Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Other Wide Area Networking (WAN) Equipment, Other Core Infrastructure Equipment, Server Computer Systems and Disk Storage
Systems. If there are 50 or more stocks classified as Tier 1a and Tier 1b, then all of Tier 1a and Tier 1b stocks are selected for inclusion in the Underlying Index, and the Index Provider does not look to Tier 2 companies. If less than 50 stocks
are classified as Tier 1a and Tier 1b, the largest eligible Tier 2 stocks, determined by the Index Provider according to the company’s FMC, are selected until the total stocks in the Underlying Index reach 50, at which point the Index Provider
