<div>The iShares International Dividend Growth ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of international equities with a history of consistently growing dividends.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 42% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index<sup>SM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which is a dividend dollars weighted index that seeks to measure the performance of international equities selected
based on a consistent history of growing dividends, as determined by Morningstar Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “Morningstar”). The Underlying Index is a subset of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup>, which is a diversified
broad market index that represents approximately 97% of the market capitalization in international developed and emerging markets, as defined by Morningstar. Eligible companies for the Underlying Index must pay a qualified dividend, must have at
least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth and must have an earnings payout ratio of less than 75%. Companies that are in the top decile of the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index based on dividend yield are excluded from the
Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Underlying Index was comprised of stocks of companies in 40
countries as of March 31, 2018. The Underlying Index may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies. As of March 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer defensive
and financials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the
securities in the Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Fund generally
will invest at least 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money
market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying
Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may
lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Morningstar, which
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or
instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div> <div>Concentration
Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that
the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Defensive Industry Risk. <font>Consumer defensive companies include companies engaged in the manufacturing of food, beverages, household and personal products, packaging, or tobacco. It also includes companies that provide services
such as education and training services. Consumer defensive companies may be adversely affected by government regulation, consumers' disposable income and consumer preferences, and social trends.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which
the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the
Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there
are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities
in which the Fund invests.</div> <div>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.<font> The Fund’s emphasis on dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the broader market. Also, a company may reduce or eliminate
its dividend.</font></div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of
common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon
the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations,
economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by
applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology
malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit
rating of an issuer of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. There is no
guarantee that an issuer that paid dividends in the past will continue to do so in the future or will continue paying dividends at the same level.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities</font></div> </div> <div>

<div>exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to
be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (<font>i.e</font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations
could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively
to increases in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to</font><font> Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and</font><font> European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service
providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address
every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its portfolio companies' trading partners, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk and European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.
In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves risks
associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of
jurisdictions, including the U.S., Canada and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. These and future sanctions, or even the threat of further
sanctions, may adversely affect Russia’s economy and the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable,</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the
Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), differences in transaction costs, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, tax gains
or losses, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions.
Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding
fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value
investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”) (formerly known as BATS Exchange, Inc.). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should
not constitute a complete investment program.</div> <div>An index is
a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons,
including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's
use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments
to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment.
Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which
a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's
listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not
comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to
rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its portfolio.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Economic events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the
Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund invests. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict
with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of
hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with demands
for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors including, among
other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a
particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience increased price
volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Defensive Industry Risk.<font> The Fund is subject to risks faced by companies in the consumer defensive industry, including: governmental regulation affecting the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods, which could
affect profitability; new laws or litigation that may adversely affect tobacco companies; fads, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting supply and demand that may strongly affect securities prices and profitability of food, beverages and
fashion related products; and international events that may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency,
even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>market increases. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change
quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related “cyber”
risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause
the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or
unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through
“hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining
unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users).
Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to
calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations
of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions,
shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While
the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been
identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index
Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</font></div>
<div>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. <font>The
Fund's strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to continue to pay
dividends on such stocks. Therefore, there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future or the anticipated acceleration of dividends may not occur. Depending upon</font></div> </div>

<div>market conditions, dividend-paying stocks that meet the Fund’s
investment criteria may not be widely available and/or may be highly concentrated in only a few market sectors. For example, the number of issuers with annual dividend growth may decline during certain market conditions. This may limit the ability
of the Fund to produce current income while remaining diversified against risks specific to such issuers or sectors.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be
more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The EU
requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries
that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU
member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced
volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and
Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</font></div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU. The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from
the EU. Although the precise timeframe for the U.K.’s withdrawal is uncertain, on March 29, 2017, the U.K. initiated the withdrawal process by sending a formal notice of the country’s intention to withdraw from the EU. An agreement has
been reached between the U.K. and the EU to continue negotiations on the U.K.’s exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remain uncertain.</div>

movement in Spain, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>instability and uncertainty in the region. The occurrence of terrorist
incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future
regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments
outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the
availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse
impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years,
cyber attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically
sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be
in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or
guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and
corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Therefore, gains, losses or costs associated with errors of the Index Provider or its agents
will generally be borne by the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying
Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management
decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors.
Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. There is no guarantee that an issuer that paid dividends in the past will continue to do so in
the future or will continue paying dividends at the same level. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts
operations.</font></div> <div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>

<div>the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is
subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Market risks may be influenced by price, currency and interest rate movements. The value of a security or
other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group
of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same
impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who
trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely
to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely
that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand
imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in
trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may
contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is open, there are
likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the
Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div> </div>

other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be
inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits.
BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economies of some countries or regions in which the Fund invests are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of these countries or regions,
institution of tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of their key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such countries or regions.</font></div>

financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed
countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to
territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the
issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of
recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed
country economies.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Russia.<font> Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, in addition to those described under “Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets” and “Non-U.S. Securities Risk” that are not typically
associated with investing in U.S. securities, including:</font></div> <div>

Bodies”), have imposed economic sanctions, which can consist of prohibiting certain securities trades, prohibiting certain private transactions in the energy sector, asset freezes and prohibition of all business, against certain Russian
individuals and Russian corporate entities. The Sanctioning Bodies could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian
securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of the Fund
to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>assets. Additional sanctions against Russia have been, and may in the future
be, imposed by the U.S. or other countries.</div> <div>The sanctions
against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions may impair the ability of the Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the
affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for the Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, “affected securities”), or if deemed
appropriate by BFA, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase the Fund's transaction costs. The Fund may also be legally
required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</div> <div>Also, if
an affected security is included in the Fund’s Underlying Index, the Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the
investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase the Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying
Index, the Fund may not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error between the Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Current or future sanctions may result in Russia taking counter
measures or retaliatory actions, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures may include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by the Fund. In the event of such a freeze of any Fund
assets, including depositary receipts, the Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in the Fund receiving substantially lower
prices for its securities.</div> <div>These sanctions may also lead
to changes in the Fund’s Underlying Index. The Fund’s Index Provider may remove securities from the Underlying Index or implement caps on the securities of certain issuers that have been subject to recent economic sanctions. In such an
event, it is expected that the Fund will rebalance its portfolio to bring it in line with the Underlying Index as a result of any such changes, which may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. These sanctions, the volatility that
may result in the trading markets for Russian securities and the possibility that Russia may impose investment or currency controls on investors may cause the Fund to invest in, or increase the Fund’s investments in, depositary receipts that
represent the securities of the Underlying Index. These investments may result in increased transaction costs and increased tracking error.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the
event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic
areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the
markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
countries in which the Fund invests may experience currency devaluations, substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on their economies and securities markets</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), differences in transaction costs, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the
Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and
expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low
volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities
or other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets
denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate
the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days
when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies.</div> <div>Borrowing
Risk.<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may
reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Recently adopted regulations of the Prudential Regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important
banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other
derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings
and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Cyclical Industry
Risk.<font> The success of consumer cyclical companies is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in demographics
and preferences. Companies in the consumer cyclical industry sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe
competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk.<font> Custody risk
refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to
complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets.
In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets are, the greater the likelihood of custody problems.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare</font></div> </div>

<div>sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The
effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s
profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in
price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector
may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be
enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger
percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the
stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than
large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>North American Economic Risk<font>. A
decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of the North American countries in
which the Fund invests.</font></div> <div>The U.S. is Canada's and
Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994
among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including possible termination of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S. on Canadian aluminum and
steel, may have implications for the trade arrangements among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North
American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Privatization Risk.<font> Some
countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been
privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some
cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.<font> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater
market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found
in more developed markets. Additionally, the risk of nationalization of private assets is greater in emerging market countries than developed countries. Moreover, emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements,
less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control
than developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts of foreign trade and investment.</font></div>
<div>Technology Sector Risk.<font>
Technology companies, including information technology companies, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may have limited product
lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the
services of qualified personnel. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.22%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order
to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2018, BFA and its</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>partners, trustees, managing members, officers and employees (collectively,
the “Affiliates”)) in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and the other Affiliates
provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and the other Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services
and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more of the other Affiliates acts, or may
act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, agent or principal, and have other direct
and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in,
engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which BFA or an Affiliate performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities
of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund also
may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase, distribute or sell services
or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Affiliates
in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions.</div>
<div>BFA or an Affiliate may engage in proprietary trading and
advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund, including securities issued by
other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The
trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or
having interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>No Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment
opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other
accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also
possible.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into
transactions in which BFA’s or an Affiliate’s other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by Affiliate-advised clients may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more Affiliate-advised clients
or by BFA may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will retain a share of the
securities lending revenues. BFA or an Affiliate will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of cash collateral. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under
the securities lending program.</div> <div>The activities of BFA or
the Affiliates may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the Fund's SAI for further
information.</div> <div>Shareholder Information</div>

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IGRO.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading</div> </div>

<div>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly
launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying
securities.</div> <div>The Board has adopted a policy of not
monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s
portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly
through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading
activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe BZX.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act restricts investments by
investment companies in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules
or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust, the registered
investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized
portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is
based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other
assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The
IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of
certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to
its accuracy.</div> <div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern
time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing
market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market
or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total
liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in non-U.S. securities. Foreign currency
exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price
its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem
Fund shares.</div> <div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities,
U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the
Fund are determined as of such times.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not
readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer
appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or
closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities,
that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or
highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair
valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation
of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an
arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during
the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying
Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font>
No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial
owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available
and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the
Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as
long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified
dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is
imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are
qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with
respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50%
of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”), generally the
Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you
may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.

<div>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of
long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation
Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The
prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div> </div>

<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer, processing and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The
standard creation and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation and redemption transaction fees are charged on each Creation Unit created or redeemed, as applicable, by an Authorized Participant on the day
of the transaction. The standard transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased or redeemed, but may be reduced by the Fund if transfer and processing expenses
associated with the creation or redemption are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a purchase or redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an additional transaction charge (up
to the maximum amounts shown in the table below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to a creation or redemption transaction. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund
shares may pay fees for such services.</font></div> <div>The
following table shows, as of April 30, 2018, the approximate value of one Creation Unit, standard fees and maximum additional charges for creations and redemptions (as described above and in the Fund's SAI):</div> <div>

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 and the first two calendar quarters of 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of March 31, 2018</div>

managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund
(each, an “Underlying Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund
offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities (including any
portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash Component”) (other than the iShares
India 50 ETF, which currently issues Creation Units of its shares solely for cash). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”) (formerly known as BATS
Exchange, Inc.), The Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) (each, a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be
at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Portfolio Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange
for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI) (other than the iShares India 50 ETF, which currently redeems Creation Units of its shares solely
for cash). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 50,000 to 250,000 shares or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that
creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject
to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 115%, which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted
Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs
associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of
shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act restricts investments by
investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Funds beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief
obtained by the Trust, the registered investment company must enter</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

to invest in the Funds only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares of each Fund are
listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of each Fund may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Listing
Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month period
beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which a Fund is based is no
longer calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a
Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund or in the event a Fund does not comply with the continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s Prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional information regarding the
indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or through other widely disseminated means, an updated
indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor. The Trust is not involved in or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has an equity securities component and a cash
component. The equity securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit Securities required to be deposited in connection with the purchase of a
Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Funds at a particular point in time because the current portfolio of the Fund may include securities that are not a part of the
current Deposit Securities. Therefore, a Fund’s IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours should not be viewed as a real-time update of the Fund’s NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an IOPV consists of estimated
accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share prices of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing
primarily in securities issued by issuers that comprise its relevant Underlying Index and through transactions that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively
managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>The iShares India 50 ETF seeks to achieve its objective by
investing all its assets that are invested in Indian securities in a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the Republic of Mauritius (the “Subsidiary”). BFA serves as investment adviser to both the Fund and the Subsidiary. Unless otherwise
indicated, references made in this SAI to the iShares India 50 ETF refer to the Subsidiary and/or the Fund as applicable.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is
investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry
weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the
securities that are in its underlying index.</div> <div>Although
the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. Under normal market conditions, any borrowing by a Fund (except the iShares India 50
ETF) will not exceed 10% of the Fund's net assets; however, each Fund (except the iShares India 50 ETF and iShares International Dividend Growth ETF) generally does not intend to borrow money. iShares International Dividend Growth ETF, along with
certain other iShares funds, has entered into a line of credit with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) that may be used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of
portfolio holdings.</font></div> <div>The purchase of securities
while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities
while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed
the income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a
Fund’s shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</div>
<div>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank
or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of
a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a
Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Currency Transactions.<font>  A
currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (“OTC”) obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract is agreed upon
by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon exchange rate and the
market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a specified future
time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures contracts will be maintained. Each Fund
does not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of the Funds' assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S. currency forward and non-U.S. currency
futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</font></div>
<div>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of
risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and prices, can occur in such markets within very short
periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference by foreign governments through regulation of
local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange
transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. Each Fund could experience losses if the value of its currency
forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, including trading
commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

classified as “diversified” under the 1940 Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment
companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer.
With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum
distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment
objectives.</div> <div>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities
Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund may
enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from
the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included
in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures
contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon
termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the
futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund may elect to
close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery
obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the</div>

<div>underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior
to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures
margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the futures contract. The potential for loss
related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to
reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential
for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on
futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate
existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily
basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out
Events”). Investments in futures contracts and other investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each
Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to its obligations relative to the position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each
Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s daily marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional
value (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of the underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were
required to set aside assets equal to the futures contracts’ full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies in the future to comply with any
changes in the guidance articulated from time to time by the SEC or its staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or
other derivatives or make investments in such instruments more expensive.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments.<font>
 Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven
calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Funds’
liquidity risk management program (the “Liquidity Program”) as required by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act (the “Liquidity Rule”). Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund
may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial
actions be taken.</font></div> <div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>  Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at
least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's
total</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate
a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have received if the
securities were not on loan.</div> <div>With respect to loans that
are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid
to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term
instruments either directly on behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an
exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending,
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board
of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could
trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments for dividends received by a Fund for securities loaned out by the
Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt
securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities.<font>
 Each Fund intends to purchase publicly-traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, the Fund's investment in such stocks may be in the form of American Depositary Receipts
(“ADRs”), Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) and European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”) (collectively, “depositary receipts”). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust
issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by an American bank or trust
company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as Continental Depositary Receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that
evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use
in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the world.</font></div>
<div>The Funds will not invest in any unlisted depositary receipt
or any depositary receipt that BFA deems illiquid at the time of purchase or for which pricing information is not readily available. In general, depositary receipts must be sponsored, but a Fund may invest in unsponsored depositary receipts under
certain limited circumstances.</div> <div>Depositary receipts are
generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to additional risks
associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency risk and liquidity risk.
Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the shareholder benefits that come from
investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</div> <div>Investing
in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of</div>

U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource
self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”), or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity
pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term
“commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to the iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF, iShares
Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF, iShares India 50 ETF and iShares International Dividend Growth ETF. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with respect to the
Funds.</div> <div>The iShares Asia 50 ETF and iShares Latin America
40 ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”) may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (which for purposes of the no-action letter
referenced below may include certain securitized vehicles, mortgage real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and/or investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA
has no transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the advisor of a fund that
invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional
guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the advisor of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for such Fund to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to
registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of such Fund.</div>
<div>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps,
currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.
jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in through 2020. Implementation of the margining
and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result,
may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div> <div>As a result
of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, a Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the applicable derivatives
contract. To the extent that derivatives contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection with
derivatives contracts that are performed on a net basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the
contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on
cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div> <div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires the security and the
seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans
by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities
will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in
connection with the disposition of the collateral.</div> <div>In
any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement
is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within
seven days.</div> <div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for
a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot
be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to
default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would
likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of
the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund’s exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a
value equal to or greater than the Fund’s obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in
additional securities.</font></div> <div>Securities of Investment
Companies.<font>  Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered
investment companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10%
of a Fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not
limited to, money market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for
operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. In addition, the iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF, in order to improve its portfolio liquidity and its ability to
track its Underlying Index, may invest up to 10% of its assets in shares of other iShares funds that provide exposure similar to certain of the markets included in its Underlying Index. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees and
expenses in an amount equal to the iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF's pro rata share of the fees and expenses attributable to the Fund's investments in other iShares funds. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses
of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro
rata</font><font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>  Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that
may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs), bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and
non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by
Moody's<sup>®</sup> Investors Service, Inc., “F-1” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or “A-1” by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate
debt securities (<font>e.g.</font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the
requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to
obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at
stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</div>
<div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap
agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on the change in market value or level of a specified rate, index or asset. In return, the other party agrees to make periodic
payments to the first party based on the return of a different specified rate, index or asset. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the
excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an aggregate value at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained by the
Fund.</font></div> <div>Certain of the Funds may enter into
currency, interest rate or index swaps. The use of currency, interest rate and index swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions.
These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>
<div>Tracking Stocks.<font>  A
tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or operating division within a larger company and is designed to “track” the performance of such business unit or division. The tracking
stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the same rights
as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an
investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding
that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of stocks in general, and other factors that affect the
market.</div> <div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost a Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may
reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk. <font> Custody
risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets make
trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of
their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of security certificates. In
general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions
in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The
possibility of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the
laws of certain countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such
custody problems and may have no successful claim for compensation.</div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font>  There is
no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.
<font> A Fund's strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not
required to continue to pay dividends on such stocks. Therefore, there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future or the anticipated acceleration of dividends may not occur. Depending upon
market conditions, dividend-paying stocks that meet the Fund’s investment criteria may not be widely available and/or may be highly concentrated in only a few market sectors.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management Rule Risk.<font>  In October 2016, the SEC adopted the Liquidity Rule requiring open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program and enhance
disclosures regarding fund liquidity. Effective December 1, 2018, as required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented the initial portions of the Funds' Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of
the Funds, has appointed BFA as the liquidity risk program administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA, assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk. Certain aspects of the Liquidity
Program were implemented effective December 1, 2018, while the entire Program will take effect on June 1, 2019. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as
defined in the Liquidity Rule.</font></div> <div>National Closed
Market Trading Risk. <font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by a Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the securities exchange on which a Fund’s shares trade is open, there are
likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a
Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations may result in premiums or discounts to a Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA
and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that could negatively impact the
Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, the personnel and
resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to
disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
occurrence or effects.</font></div> <div>Risk of Derivatives.<font>  A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a
measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options and other
derivatives. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests
only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To
address such leverage and to prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of
the investment.</font></div> <div>When a derivative is used as a
hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can</div> </div>

<div>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains and, in
some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and a Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and
there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Equity Securities.<font>
 An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of stock
markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to increases and decreases in
value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders generally
have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity
(the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither
a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</font></div>
<div>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are
listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in such securities.
There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for
the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are wide.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed only on the exchange on
which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time.
Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In
the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily
margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered
call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered stock index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures
position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to
the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they
invest.</div> <div>Utilization of futures and options on futures by
a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy
of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome
margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. The daily</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract
may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is
possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the
event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. <font> An investment in each Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic
and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in
currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations include
favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Investing in the Funds also involves certain
risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price
volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; in the case of the iShares India 50 ETF,
restrictions on ownership of Indian and other foreign countries' securities by foreign entities; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower
liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of
inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Swap Agreements.<font>
 The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations. If
such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s rights as a creditor
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</font></div>
<div>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin
(comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Implementation of regulations requiring posting of initial margin is being phased in through 2020. These requirements may raise the costs for a
Fund’s investment in swaps.</div> <div>Treaty/Tax Risk.<font>  The iShares India 50 ETF operates, in part, through the Subsidiary, which in turn invests in securities of Indian issuers. The Subsidiary should be eligible to take advantage of the benefits of the Double Tax
Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius (“DTAA”) in relation to investments in shares made until March 31, 2017. Numerous investors have relied on the benefits of the DTAA to invest in India through Mauritius in the
past.</font></div> <div>An investor is required to submit the tax
residency certificate (“TRC”) as issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and information as prescribed by the Government of India to claim benefits under the DTAA.</div>
<div>Under the DTAA, India has right to tax capital gains that
arise from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident. However, the DTAA provides for grandfathering of investments in shares made before April 1, 2017. Returns from investments in shares made on or after April 1,
2017 are subject to capital gains tax in India, although the DTAA provides for a limitation of benefits provision which shall be a prerequisite for a reduced rate of tax (50% of domestic tax rate) on capital gains arising during a two year
transition period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. The application of such provisions of the DTAA could result in the imposition of withholding and capital gains taxes and/or other taxes on the Subsidiary by tax authorities in India. This could
significantly reduce the return to the iShares India 50 ETF on its investments in shares and the return received by the Fund’s shareholders.</div>
<div>Criteria for Residence of Companies in India.</div>
<div>A foreign company will be considered a resident in India if
its place of effective management (“POEM”) (defined as a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are in substance made) is in India in the relevant
financial year. This test is to be applied taking the relevant financial year as a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

tax and withholding obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (“indirect transfers”). It has been clarified that Indian tax
authorities will not reopen any assessment proceedings that were completed before April 1, 2012 and where no notice for reassessment has been issued prior to that date. It has also been clarified that any assessment or any other order which stands
validated due to the amendments in the Finance Act would be enforced. Given this clarification issued by the CBDT, the iShares India 50 ETF does not expect that their respective shareholders or each Fund will become subject to tax or to withholding
obligations with respect to completed assessments.</div> <div>It
has been clarified that the share or interest of the foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the
value of all the assets owned by the foreign entity. The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, of such an asset without reduction of liabilities. The fair market value will be determined in accordance with the
final Rule 11UB of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”). It has also been provided that where all the assets of the foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian
assets shall be subject to capital gains tax in India. The indirect transfer shall not be applicable in following cases:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>With respect to a foreign
entity that holds the Indian assets directly, if the transferor of share or interest in such a foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer neither holds the right of control
or management in the foreign entity, nor holds voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in such foreign entity. </td></tr>
<tr>

 </td>
<td>With
respect to a foreign entity that holds the Indian assets indirectly, if the transferor of share or interest in such foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer does not hold
the right of control or management in relation to the foreign entity, which would entitle them to the right of control or management in the foreign entity which directly holds the Indian assets; or does not hold voting power or share capital or
interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in the foreign entity, which results in holding the same share capital or voting power in the entity which directly holds the Indian assets. </td></tr></table>
</div> <div>If the gains arising from transfer of share or interest
in a foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes.</div>
<div>Gains realized when a non-resident acquires shares of a
foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives “substantial value” from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50% of the value of the
company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably attributable to the Indian assets.</div>
<div>Because the iShares India 50 ETF invests in Indian securities
through the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary or the iShares India 50 ETF may be considered to derive “substantial value” from Indian assets. Accordingly, shareholder redemptions of the iShares India 50 ETF shares and sales of the iShares India
50 ETF shares may have been subject to Indian tax and withholding obligations. The IT Act provides for an exemption to shareholders in Category I and Category II foreign portfolio investors (“FPI”) from the applicability of indirect
transfer taxation. The Subsidiary is a Category II FPI. Therefore, any redemptions or transfers by the iShares India 50 ETF or the shareholders in the iShares India 50 ETF should not be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax.</div>
<div>The IT Act further provides that aforesaid indirect transfer
provisions will not apply to foreign investors making an investment directly or indirectly in a Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) registered Category I and Category II foreign portfolio investor.</div>
<div>General Anti-Avoidance Rules.</div>
<div>The current legislation provides for the general
anti-avoidance rules (“GAAR”) to curb aggressive tax planning with the use of sophisticated structures. CBDT has clarified that where a FPI (such as the Subsidiary) is located in a particular jurisdiction</div> </div>

<div>based on non-tax commercial reasons and the main purpose of the choice of

<div>As per the provisions of GAAR, an arrangement entered into by
a taxpayer may be declared to be an impermissible avoidance arrangement, if the “main purpose” of the arrangement is to obtain a “tax benefit” and the arrangement:</div> <div>

<div>GAAR may, irrespective of existing treaty provisions, lead to
the imposition of tax liabilities and withholding obligations, and may lead the iShares India 50 ETF to modify the structure.</div>
<div>Indian Minimum Alternate Tax.</div>
<div>The IT Act provides that Minimum Alternate Tax
(“MAT”) is not applicable on foreign company where the foreign company is a resident of a country with which India has signed a DTAA and the foreign company does not have a permanent establishment in India in accordance with such
DTAA.</div> <div>Recent amendments to the DTAA and GAAR could
change the manner in which the Subsidiary is currently taxed in India and could adversely impact the returns to the iShares India 50 ETF/Subsidiary and their shareholders. The iShares India 50 ETF will continue to monitor developments in India with
respect to these matters. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to their own tax situations and the tax consequences of an investment in the iShares India 50 ETF.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Large-Capitalization Companies. <font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Mid-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies, and, therefore, a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a
larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments,
and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it more difficult for the Funds to buy and sell them. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies
and are more susceptible to adverse developments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Small-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies, and, therefore, a Fund's share price may be more volatile than that of funds that invest a larger percentage of
their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization or mid-capitalization</font></div> </div>

<div>companies to adverse business and economic developments. The stocks of
small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Funds to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on
a small number of essential personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse
developments concerning their products.</div> <div>Risk of Investing
in Africa.<font>  Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political
instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and,
in certain countries, genocidal warfare.</font></div> <div>Certain
countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of countries in
Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated with market
volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended
altogether.</div> <div>Market volatility may also be heightened by
the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need to effect securities transactions through
these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (<font>i.e., </font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that
a Fund effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</div>
<div>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control
to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign
investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes
available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may
not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value of a Fund’s investments. Issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with
regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed
countries.</div> <div>In addition, governments of certain countries
in Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of
foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.</div>
<div>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater
degree of risk associated with governmental approval in connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s
balance of payments declines, such African country may impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local government approvals or take other
actions, each of which may involve additional costs to the Fund.</div>
<div>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new
and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights.</div> </div>

<div>Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended
laws and regulations. In addition, there may be no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in Africa are
subject may be less advanced than those systems to which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such countries may not receive many of the protections available to shareholders of
issuers located in more developed countries. Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at
federal, regional and local levels in countries in Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</div>
<div>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary
commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a
Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a
result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise
substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on
private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime,
including organized crime.</div> <div>Recent political instability
and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries in those countries and adversely impacted the
region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly through the region, and that
developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to investments in
the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>
  Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation and/or
nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and
there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short
histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have
each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated
tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Political, religious, and border
disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect
the performance of investments in this region.</div> <div>Certain
governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their</div>

<div>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government
actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in
the region.</div> <div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule
of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are
experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. Adverse economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the
risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia. <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and
flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on trading with
certain key trading partners, including Asia, Europe and the U.S. The Australia–U.S. Free Trade Agreement has significantly expanded the trading relationship between the U.S. and Australia. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key
trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australian economy. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in the
mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Brazil.
<font> Investment in securities of companies domiciled in Brazil involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks
include, among others, a high level of price volatility in the Brazilian equity and currency markets, chronic structural public sector deficits, a rising unemployment rate and disparities of wealth.</font></div>
<div>Brazil has historically experienced high rates of inflation
and may continue to do so in the future. An increase in prices for commodities, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency (the real) and potential future governmental measures seeking to maintain the value of the real in relation to the U.S.
dollar, may trigger increases in inflation in Brazil and may slow the rate of growth of the Brazilian economy. Inflationary pressures also may limit the ability of certain Brazilian issuers to access foreign financial markets and may lead to further
government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that may adversely affect the overall performance of the Brazilian economy, which in turn could adversely affect a Fund's investments.</div>
<div>The Brazilian government has exercised, and continues to
exercise, significant influence over the Brazilian economy, which may have significant effects on Brazilian companies and on market conditions and prices of Brazilian securities. The Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and
occasionally drastic, intervention by the Brazilian government. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the core of Brazil’s economy. The Brazilian government’s
actions to control inflation and affect other economic policies have involved, among others, the setting of wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, fluctuation of the base interest rates, imposing exchange controls and limiting
imports into Brazil. In the past, the Brazilian government has maintained domestic price controls, and no assurances can be given that price controls will not be re-imposed in the future.</div>
<div>Investments in Brazilian securities may be subject to certain
restrictions on foreign investment. Brazilian law provides that whenever a serious imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments exists or is anticipated, the Brazilian government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign
investors of the proceeds of their investment in Brazil and on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. The likelihood of such restrictions may be affected by the extent of Brazil’s foreign currency reserves, the size of
Brazil’s debt service burden relative to the economy as a whole, and political constraints to which Brazil may be subject. There can be no assurance that the Brazilian government will not impose</div> </div>

<div>restrictions or restrictive exchange control policies in the future, which
could have the effect of preventing or restricting access to foreign currency.</div>
<div>The market for Brazilian securities is directly influenced by
the flow of international capital, and economic and market conditions of certain countries, especially other emerging market countries in Central and South America. Adverse economic conditions or developments in other emerging market countries have
at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the Brazilian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in Brazil. Crises in neighboring emerging market countries
also may increase investors’ risk aversion, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by Brazilian companies, including securities in which a Fund may invest.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. <font> The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and political
instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the regions and many economies in these regions are particularly sensitive
to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of these regions.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Central and South
America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a
negative impact on the securities in which a Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public
corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div> <div>Certain
countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values
and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition,
certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the
U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. A Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China.
<font> Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks
include, among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring
countries.</font></div> <div>Military conflicts, either in response
to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements with Hong Kong related to integration and religious and nationalist disputes with
Tibet and the Xinjiang region. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan that has included threats of invasion; Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between
China and Taiwan may adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense
concerns. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect performance of the Chinese economy.</div>
<div>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic
reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be
effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. The Chinese government
continues to maintain a major role in economic policy making and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on
repatriation of capital invested. In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China are not
subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>with respect to such matters as insider trading rules, tender offer
regulation, stockholder proxy requirements and the requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. Stock markets in China are in the process of change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in
the settlement and recording of transactions and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation.</div>
<div>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of
rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy and securities market. China’s economy is heavily
dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of tariffs or other trade barriers, including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S., or a downturn in any of the economies
of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the securities of Chinese issuers.</div>
<div>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of
China (“PRC”) are subject to change, including the issuance of authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as
consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on a Fund and its investors, particularly in
relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In addition, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese companies may be less rigorous, and may result in significant
differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with the PRC accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets.<font>  Certain Funds may invest in H-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (“SEHK”)) and/or B-shares
(securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”)) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”)) and listed
on the SSE and the SZSE). Certain Funds may also invest in certain Hong Kong listed securities known as Red-Chips (securities issued by companies incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly or indirectly, by
entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial revenues or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are
controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial revenues or allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</font></div>
<div>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into two
classes: A-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on the SSE and SZSE), which are mostly limited to domestic investors, and B-shares, which are allocated for both international and
domestic investors. The A-shares market is generally subject to greater government restrictions, including trading suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B-shares market is generally smaller, less liquid and has a smaller
issuer base than the A-shares market, which may lead to significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of
B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a “back-door listing” through Red-Chips or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. “Back-door listing” is
a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. All of these share mechanisms are relatively untested and subject to political and economic policy in
China. Market developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government intervention (including the possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may make it difficult to acquire, dispose of
or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If
financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect
to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>many developed countries and their perceived inability to continue to service
high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain
developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation,
extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed
countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed
country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among
others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a
Fund’s investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Eastern
Europe. <font> Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western
Europe. Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments have expropriated substantial amounts of private
property, and many claims of the property owners have never been fully settled.</font></div>
<div>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market
economies at different paces with different characteristics. Most Eastern European securities markets suffer from thin trading activity, dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate information. Information and transaction
costs, differential taxes, and sometimes political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor. In addition, these markets are particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and
currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia also may attempt to assert its influence in the region through economic or even military measures, as
it did with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014. Eastern European economies may also be particularly susceptible to changes in the international credit markets due to their reliance on bank related inflows of capital. The
global economic crisis has restricted international credit supplies, and several Eastern European economies have faced significant credit and economic crises. Although some Eastern European economies are expanding again, major challenges are still
present as a result of their continued dependence on the Western European zone for credit.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. <font>  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity
and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation
by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local
governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments
imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor
the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market
valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.</font></div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even
the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the
securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example,
prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced
liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or
in order to meet redemption requests.</div> <div>Many emerging
market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be
weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market countries in the past
have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic
instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax
policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign
securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Emerging markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.
<font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have
significant operations in, member states of the Economic and Monetary Union (the “EMU”) of the European Union (the “EU”), which requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates,
debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common
currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the
economies of EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries do not use the euro, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the euro zone. Consequently, these countries must comply with
many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt
in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute
“capital controls.” Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any
European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the
credit ratings of certain European countries were recently downgraded. These downgrades may result in further deterioration of investor confidence. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to
significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures
and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt
could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur
in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”)
resolved to leave the EU. The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. Although the precise timeframe for the U.K.’s withdrawal is uncertain, on
March 29, 2017, the U.K. initiated the withdrawal process by sending a formal notice of the country’s intention to withdraw from the EU. An agreement has been reached between the U.K. and the EU to continue negotiations on the U.K.’s
exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. Secessionist movements, such as in Scotland or the Catalan movement in Spain, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty
in the region. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity of
a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in India. <font> India is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to more developed markets. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has recently
experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries, including Pakistan, and the Indian government has confronted separatist movements in several Indian states, including Kashmir.
Government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets offer higher potential for losses. Governmental actions could have a negative effect on the economic conditions in
India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of investments made by a Fund. The securities markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped and with some exceptions, consist of a small number of listed companies with small market
capitalization, greater price volatility and substantially less liquidity than companies in more developed markets. Stockbrokers and other intermediaries in India may not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S. or other, more developed
countries. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may also affect a Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price or time that it desires or the Fund’s ability to track its Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Global factors and foreign actions may inhibit the flow of
foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian companies, which may decrease the liquidity of a Fund’s portfolio and result in extreme
volatility in the prices of Indian securities. In November 2016, the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial markets. These factors, coupled with the lack of
extensive accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices, as applicable in the U.S., may increase the risk of loss for a Fund.</div>
<div>Securities laws in India are relatively new and unsettled and,
as a result, there is a risk of significant and unpredictable change in laws governing foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Foreign investors in particular may be adversely affected by new or amended
laws and regulations. Certain Indian regulatory approvals, including approvals from SEBI, the central government and the tax authorities (to the extent that tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before a Fund can make investments in
Indian companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Technology and software sectors represent a significant
portion of the total capitalization of the Indian securities markets. The value of these companies will generally fluctuate in response to technological and regulatory developments, and, as a result, a Fund’s holdings are expected to
experience correlated fluctuations.</div> <div>Natural disasters,
such as tsunamis, flooding or droughts, could occur in India or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Indian economy or operations of a Subsidiary, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Latin America. <font> A number of Latin American countries are among the largest debtors of developing countries and have a long history of foreign debt and default. In 2001, Argentina defaulted on its debt and many investors suffered
significant losses.</font></div> <div>The majority of the region's
economies have become highly dependent upon foreign credit and loans from external sources to fuel their state-sponsored economic plans. Historically, government profligacy and ill-conceived plans for modernization have exhausted these resources
with little benefit accruing to the economy. Most countries have been forced to restructure their loans or risk default on their debt obligations. In addition, interest on the debt is subject to market conditions and may reach levels that would
impair economic activity and create a difficult and costly environment for borrowers. Accordingly, these governments may be forced to reschedule or freeze their debt repayment, which could negatively affect local markets. Because of their dependence
on foreign credit and loans, a number of Latin American economies face significant economic difficulties and some economies fell into recession as the recent global economic crisis tightened international credit supplies. While the region has
recently shown signs of economic improvement, recovery from past economic downturns in Latin America has historically been slow, and any such recovery, if sustained, may be gradual.</div>
<div>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Latin American
countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments and difficulties in enforcing legal judgments in non-U.S. courts. Legal remedies available to investors in certain Latin American countries may be
less extensive than those available to investors in the U.S. or other countries. In addition, certain Latin American countries may have legal systems that may make it difficult for the Fund to vote proxies, exercise shareholder rights, and pursue
legal remedies with respect to its investments. In the past, many Latin American countries have experienced substantial, and in some periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. For companies that keep accounting records in the local
currency, inflation accounting rules in some Latin American countries require, for both tax and accounting purposes, that certain assets and liabilities be restated on the company’s balance sheet in order to express items in terms of currency
of constant purchasing power. Inflation accounting may indirectly generate losses or profits for certain Latin American companies.</div>
<div>Certain Latin American countries have entered into regional
trade agreements that are designed to, among other things, reduce barriers between countries, increase competition among companies and reduce government subsidies in certain industries. No assurance can be given that these changes will be successful
in the long term, or that these changes will result in the economic stability intended. There is a possibility that these trade arrangements will not be fully implemented, or will be partially or completely unwound. It is also possible that a
significant participant could choose to abandon a trade agreement, which could diminish its credibility and influence. Any of these occurrences could have adverse effects on the markets of both participating and non-participating countries,
including sharp appreciation or depreciation of participants’ national currencies and a significant increase in exchange rate volatility, a resurgence in economic protectionism, an undermining of confidence in the Latin American markets, an
undermining of Latin American economic stability, the collapse or slowdown of the drive towards Latin American economic unity, and/or reversion of the attempts to lower government debt and inflation rates that were introduced in anticipation of such
trade agreements. Such developments could have an adverse impact on a Fund’s investments in Latin America generally or in specific countries participating in such trade agreements.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Mexico.
<font> Investment in Mexican issuers involves risks that are specific to Mexico, including regulatory, political, and economic risks. In the past, Mexico has experienced high interest rates, economic volatility,
significant devaluation of its currency (the peso), and high unemployment rates. The Mexican economy, among other things, is dependent upon external trade with other economies, specifically with the U.S.  and certain Latin American countries.
Recent political developments in the U.S. have potential implications for the current trade arrangements between the U.S. and Mexico, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>As a result, Mexico is dependent on, among other things, the
U.S. economy and the economies of other Central and South American countries, and any change in the price or demand for Mexican exports may have an adverse impact on the Mexican economy. Because commodities such as oil and gas, minerals and metals
represent a large portion of the region’s exports, the economies of these countries are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. For example, lower prices have negatively impacted Petróleos Mexicanos, the Mexican
state-owned petroleum company, which accounts for approximately 30% of the Mexican government’s revenue.</div>
<div>Mexico’s economy has become increasingly oriented toward
manufacturing, including electronic equipment and machinery, in the years since the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) entered into force. As Mexico’s top export is automotive vehicles, its economy is strongly tied to
the U.S. automotive market, and changes to certain segments in the U.S. market could have an impact on the Mexican economy. The automotive industry and other industrial products can be highly cyclical, and companies in these industries may suffer
periodic operating losses. These industries can be significantly affected by labor relations and fluctuating component prices.</div>
<div>The agricultural and mining sectors of Mexico’s economy
also account for a large portion of its exports; Mexico is therefore susceptible to fluctuations in the price and demand for agricultural products and natural resources. In addition, Mexico has privatized or has begun the process of privatization of
certain entities and industries, and some investors have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust to a competitive environment and changing regulatory standards.</div>
<div>Recently, Mexico has experienced an outbreak of violence
related to criminal gang activity, drug trafficking and terrorist actions. Violence near border areas, border-related political disputes, and other social upheaval may lead to strained international relations. Incidents involving Mexico’s
security may have an adverse effect on the Mexican economy and cause uncertainty in its financial markets. Mexico has also experienced contentious and very closely decided elections. Changes in political parties and other political events may affect
the economy and contribute to additional instability.</div> <div>Risk
of Investing in North America. <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North
American region and on some or all of the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has
increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including possible termination of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S. on Canadian aluminum and steel, may have implications for the trade arrangements among the U.S., Mexico and Canada,
which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a
Fund.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font> Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly
speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result
of expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and
potentially greater price volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be
expropriated, nationalized or otherwise confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more
costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the Russian court system.</font></div>
<div>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic,
political and social instability than is the case in other developed countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military involvement in political and economic decision-making,
including changes in government through extra-constitutional means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations with neighboring countries;
and (v) ethnic, religious and racial disaffection.</div> <div>The
Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly</div>

<div>vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of
terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed
conflict causing disruptions of Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future economic
sanctions may also adversely affect the Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</div>
<div>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over
many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also
the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its regional geopolitical influence (including military steps). Such
steps may increase tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may negatively affect economic growth. </div>
<div>Russia Sanctions.<font> The U.S.
and the EMU of the EU, along with the regulatory bodies of a number of countries including Japan, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and Canada (collectively, “Sanctioning Bodies”), have imposed economic sanctions, which can consist of
prohibiting certain securities trades, prohibiting certain private transactions in the energy sector, asset freezes and prohibition of all business, against certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. The Sanctioning Bodies could
also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the Russian
economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Additional
sanctions against Russia have been, and may in the future be, imposed by the U.S. or other countries. </font></div>
<div>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include
prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of
such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, “affected securities”), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind
deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund's transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</div>
<div>Also, if an affected security is included in a Fund's
Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or
increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be able to effectively implement a
representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Current or future sanctions may result in Russia taking
counter measures or retaliatory actions, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures may include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. In the event of such a freeze of any Fund
assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially lower prices
for its securities.</div> <div>These sanctions may also lead to
changes in a Fund’s Underlying Index. A Fund’s index provider may remove securities from its Underlying Index or implement caps on the securities of certain issuers that have been subject to recent economic sanctions. In such an event,
it is expected that a Fund will rebalance its portfolio to bring it in line with its Underlying Index as a result of any such changes, which may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. These sanctions, the volatility that may
result in the trading markets for Russian securities and the possibility that Russia may impose investment or currency controls on investors may cause a Fund to invest in, or increase a Fund’s investments in, depositary receipts that represent
the securities of its Underlying Index. These investments may result in increased transaction costs and increased tracking error.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in South Korea. <font> Investments in South Korean issuers involve risks that are specific to South Korea, including legal, regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risks. Substantial political tensions exist between North
Korea and South Korea. Escalated tensions involving the two nations and the outbreak of hostilities between the two nations,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse
effect on the South Korean economy. In addition, South Korea's economic growth potential has recently been on a decline, because of a rapidly aging population and structural problems, among other factors. The South Korean economy is heavily reliant
on trading exports and disruptions or decreases in trade activity could lead to further declines.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. <font> The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may be, at times, excess
capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. government, while others
formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased pension
liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Biotechnology Industry. <font> Biotechnology companies depend on the successful development of new and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that intellectual property
rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property rights may adversely affect the profitability of biotechnology companies. In addition, companies in the biotechnology industry spend heavily on
research and development and their products or services may not prove commercially successful or may become obsolete quickly. The risks of high development costs may be exacerbated by the inability to raise prices as a result of managed care
pressure, government regulation or price controls. Biotechnology companies can suffer persistent losses during the transition of new products from development to production or when products are or may be subject to regulatory approval processes or
regulatory scrutiny and, as a consequence, the earnings of biotechnology companies may be erratic. Companies in the biotechnology industry are also exposed to the risk that they will be subject to products liability claims. Companies involved in the
biotechnology industry may be subject to extensive government regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among other foreign and domestic regulators. Such
regulation may significantly affect and limit biotechnology research, product development and approval of products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend heavily on
corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, worsening business cash flows,
tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates, corporate tax
rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. <font> A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail companies, and housing-related
companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer tastes and trends, marketing
campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Defensive Industry. <font> A Fund is subject to risks faced by companies in the consumer defensive industry, including: governmental regulation affecting the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods, which could
affect profitability; new laws or litigation that may adversely affect tobacco companies; fads, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting supply and demand that may strongly affect securities prices and profitability of food, soft drink and
fashion related products; and international events that may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational
equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can
depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen.
Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics,
marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office products, clothing and
textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The consumer goods
industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various food additives may affect the profitability of certain companies in the consumer goods
industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and
litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition,
which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples
sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> <div>The energy sector is cyclical and is
highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices
have recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil
industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and</div> </div>

<div>security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of
investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor
unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a
significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by federal, state and
local governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may
materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies.</font></div> <div>Most financial companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for
companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund
invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default.
Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In
particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In
addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and
financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types of companies in
the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and
increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an
adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take
actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or
increased government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div> </div>

<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent
on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in general.
The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be
significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,
aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are
cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may
adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials
sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. <font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent</font></div> </div>

<div>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and
competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the
information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to
network security breaches, certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect
on their businesses. These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction
programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of
government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and
labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by
government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be
adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market
countries, which may heighten these risks.</div> <div>Operations
Risk. <font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have
monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political
actions.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in periods of rising interest
rates.</font></div> <div>Inflation Risk. <font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of
its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Risk. <font>The
stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
transportation industry group.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The
profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities
companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory
commissions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Materials
Sector. <font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical progress, labor
relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production
of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Medical Equipment Industry. <font> Many companies in the medical equipment industry are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the medical
equipment industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims as well as competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The profitability of some
medical equipment companies may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the
medical equipment industry are subject to regulatory approvals, and the process of obtaining such approvals is long and costly.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Natural Resources Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the natural resources industry can be affected by worldwide energy prices, limits on exploration, and production spending. Companies in the natural resources industry are affected
by government regulation, world events and economic conditions. Companies in the natural resources industry are at risk for environmental damage claims. Companies in the natural resources industry could be adversely affected by commodity price
volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls and increased competition. Companies in the natural resources industry may be adversely affected by depletion of natural resources, technological developments, and labor
relations.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Pharmaceuticals
Industry. <font> Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The profitability of some
companies in the pharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new
products in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to government approvals, regulation and reimbursement rates. The process of obtaining government approvals may be long and costly. Many companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are heavily
dependent on patents and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the pharmaceutical industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product
liability and similar claims.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in
the Real Estate Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as REITs, real estate holding companies or real estate development companies (collectively,
“Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and
operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some
risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may

<div>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and
tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the
income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to length and expense, foreclosure
proceedings may not fully uphold the validity of all of the terms of the applicable loan. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as
bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Distressed Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful
implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the securities of companies with higher credit and market
risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency
and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest
in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of
default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking. Investments
in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a
holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk.<font> Investing in
Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or
erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of
defaults within a short period.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S.
Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the
REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains
its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on
real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some
countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and
potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory
approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be
arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new
technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications
sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Timber and Forestry Industry. <font> The market value of timber and forestry companies may be negatively affected by events occurring in nature and by international and local politics. Natural disasters such as wild fires, volcanic eruptions,
flooding, and severe weather conditions may affect the output of timber and timber-related products, and demand for timber and timber-related products in the U.S. and internationally may decrease due to new or changed tariffs, quotas or trade
agreements. Rising interest rates or unfavorable economic conditions could also negatively affect the prices of or demand for timber and timber-related products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Transportation Infrastructure Industry.
<font> Issuers in the transportation infrastructure industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, industry competition, insurance
costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and airports. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their
businesses. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions.</font></div> </div>

<div>Companies in the transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely
affected by adverse weather, acts of terrorism or catastrophic events, such as air accidents, train crashes or tunnel fires. Companies in the transportation infrastructure industry may also be subject to the risk of widespread disruption of
technology systems and increasing equipment and operational costs.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations and
changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access
to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate conditions can also have a significant impact on
both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For all Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies
for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”)
governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote
proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated
person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident
shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client
responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the
dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div>

BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendices A1 and A2, respectively.</div>

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy regarding the disclosure of the
Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests of each Fund’s shareholders; (ii) does not put the
interests of BFA, the Distributor or any affiliated person of BFA or the Distributor, above those of Fund shareholders; (iii) does not advantage any current or prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund shareholders,
except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not available to other current or prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary for transactions
in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided to personnel of BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of the Fund for the purpose of facilitating risk
management and hedging activities; and (iv) does not provide selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting the use of such
information are in effect. The “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based subscription services,
large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and market makers and other institutional market
participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's portfolio holdings information
is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to those other fee-based subscription services, including market
makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading shares of the Funds in the secondary market or evaluating such
potential transactions. This information typically reflects each Fund’s anticipated holdings on the following business day.</div>
<div>Daily access to information concerning the Funds' portfolio
holdings is permitted: (i) to certain personnel of those service providers that are involved in portfolio management and providing administrative, operational, risk management, or other support to portfolio management; and (ii) to other personnel of
the Funds' investment adviser, the Distributor and their affiliates, and the administrator, custodian and fund accountant who deal directly with, or assist in, functions related to investment management, distribution, administration, custody,
securities lending and fund accounting, as may be necessary to conduct business in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. In addition, each Fund discloses its fixed-income and/or equity
portfolio holdings daily at <font>www.iShares.com</font>. More information about this disclosure is available at <font>www.iShares.com</font>.</div>
<div>Portfolio holdings information made available in connection
with the creation/redemption process may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds in the ordinary course of business after it has been disseminated to the NSCC. From time to time, information concerning portfolio holdings
other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds, including rating or ranking organizations, in the
ordinary course of business, no earlier than one business day following the date of the information.</div>
<div>Each Fund discloses its complete portfolio holdings schedule
in public filings with the SEC within 70 days of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters and within 60 days of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters and will provide such information to shareholders as required by federal
securities laws and regulations thereunder. A Fund may, however, voluntarily disclose all or part of its portfolio holdings other than in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, in advance of required filings with the
SEC, provided that such information is made generally available to all shareholders and other interested parties in a manner that is consistent with the above policy for disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Such information may be made
available through a publicly available website or other means that make the information available to all likely interested parties contemporaneously.</div>
<div>The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer or his delegate may
authorize disclosure of portfolio holdings information pursuant to the above policy and procedures, subject to restrictions on selective disclosure imposed by applicable law.</div>

<div>Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes</div>
<div>Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes are provided
below.</div> <div>With respect to certain underlying indexes of the
iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed investment concepts and strategies that could be
considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted the index using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its sole
discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the underlying
index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or pursuant to
other communications with the index provider.</div> <div>Nifty 50
Index<sup>TM</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
50</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> is designed to measure the equity performance of the top 50 companies by free float market
capitalization whose equity securities trade in the Indian securities markets that are available to international investors on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (“NSE”). The securities in the Underlying Index are free float
market capitalization-weighted so that securities with higher total free float market capitalization have a larger representation in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Index Committee.<font> NSE Indices
Limited (formerly known as India Index Services &amp; Products Limited) (“NSEI”) indexes are primarily rules-based and monitored by a governing committee.</font></div>
<div>NSEI has constituted an Index Policy Committee that is
involved in the policy and guidelines for managing indices. The Index Maintenance Subcommittee takes all decisions on additions and deletions of companies in indices.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Changes in
the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> level reflect changes in the free-float market capitalization of the constituents of the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> which are caused by stock price movements in the market. When a stock is replaced by another stock within the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup>, the index divisor is adjusted so the change in Nifty 50
Index<sup>TM</sup> market value that results from the addition and deletion does not change the index level.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The Nifty
50 Index<sup>TM</sup> is calculated continuously and is available from major data vendors. For purposes of reporting performance of the Fund, the index provider
will also make available to the Fund Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> values in U.S. dollars on an end of day basis by applying a foreign exchange rate calculation to
the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup> as determined by the index provider.</font></div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.<font>
In addition to domicile within India and a listing on the NSE, component security selection decisions include the following criteria:</font></div>
<div><font>Eligibile
Securities:</font></div> <div>Constituents of Nifty 100 Index that
are available for trading in NSE’s Futures &amp; Options segment, and the company’s trading frequency is 100% in the last six months, are eligible for inclusion in the Nifty 50 Index<sup>TM</sup>.</div>
<div><font>Liquidity:</font></div>
<div>For inclusion in the index, the security should have traded at
an average impact cost of 0.50% or less during the last six months for 90% of the observations for a portfolio of 100 million Indian Rupees. Impact cost is the cost of executing a transaction in a security in proportion to its index weight, measured
by market capitalization at any point in time. This is the percentage mark-up suffered while buying/selling the desired quantity of a security compared to its ideal price – (best buy + best sell)/2.</div>

a six-month period.</div> <div>The Morningstar Indexes</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.
<font>The Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index<sup>SM</sup> is a subset of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US
Index<sup>SM</sup>, which is a diversified broad market index that represents approximately 97% of the market capitalization in international developed and emerging
markets. To be eligible for inclusion in the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup>, companies must pay a qualified dividend, must have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth and their earnings payout ratio must be
less than 75%. Companies that are in the top decile based on dividend yield are excluded from the Underlying Index prior to the dividend growth and payout ratio screens.</font></div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> Securities are
added or deleted from the index based on rules outlined for security selection, exclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for corporate actions as set forth in the Morningstar Index Rulebook. Morningstar makes no subjective determinations related to
index composition.</font></div> <div>Index Maintenance.<font> The Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup> is reconstituted twice annually, on the Monday following the third Friday of June and the Monday following the third Friday of December. The Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index<sup>SM</sup> is reconstituted
once annually on the Monday following the third Friday December. If the Monday is a holiday, reconstitution occurs on the Tuesday immediately following. Reconstitution is carried out after the day’s closing index values have been
determined.</font></div> <div>Index Availability.<font> Morningstar Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</font></div>
<div>Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index<sup>SM</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 660</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index<sup>SM</sup>, the Underlying Index, is a dividend dollars weighted index that seeks to measure the performance of international equities selected based on a consistent
history of growing dividends. The Underlying Index is a subset of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup>, which is a diversified broad market index that represents approximately 97% of the market capitalization in international developed and emerging markets.
As of March 31, 2018, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities of companies in the following markets: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey,
United Arab Emirates and the U.K. Eligible companies must pay a qualified dividend, must have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth and their earnings payout ratio must be less than 75%. Companies that are in the top decile
based on dividend yield are excluded from the Underlying Index prior to the dividend growth, payout ratio, and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) screens.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology.<font> The
Underlying Index methodology is as follows:</font></div> <div>(1) a
security must be a member of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Markets ex-US Index<sup>SM</sup></div>
<div>(2) security must pay a qualified dividend (<font>e.g.</font>, REITs are excluded);</div>
<div>(3) top decile yield payers are excluded;</div>
<div>(4.1) apply dividend growth screen: must be currently paying
dividends and have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth; dividend growth condition is considered met if the trailing twelve months aggregated dividend increased from the previous to the current reconstitution date;</div>

<div>The S&amp;P Indexes</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria for Domestic Indexes. <font>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC’s (“SPDJI”) various Index Committees are responsible for the overall management of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC's indices (“S&amp;P DJI Indices”). Issuers
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the “components”) selected for the Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&amp;P”) U.S. indexes
represent a broad range of industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting universe of publicly traded U.S. issuers classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS<sup>®</sup>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited partnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding issuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink
sheet-listed issues, closed-end funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of each constituent must trade on either the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the
NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ. Additionally, only one share class per constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share
classes will have the classes combined for purposes of calculation of market capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s eligibility for inclusion in the S&amp;P Indexes: (i) ownership of an issuer’s
outstanding common stock, in order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the financial and operating condition of an
issuer.</font></div> <div>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are
capitalization-weighted, based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the constituent’s share price.
Issuers with float-adjusted market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion typically must be greater than the Index’s minimum market
capitalization at the time it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s constituents are adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions
and other capital events. The market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings, including private, corporate, and government holdings.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Component Selection Criteria for International Indexes. <font>Stocks are eligible for the S&amp;P Global Indices if they meet criteria for size, liquidity, profitability, and sector and market representation. Each of the S&amp;P Global Indices is balanced across country and sector
weights in the region/market. The S&amp;P Global Indices begin with an eligible investable universe of stocks covering approximately 95% of each country’s total market capitalization. In some cases, the S&amp;P Global Indexes may include ADRs
and GDRs. Stocks with relatively small market capitalization or insufficient liquidity are excluded by SPDJI. To identify a candidate pool for index constituent selection, all stocks are carefully examined using a set of general criteria. The
specific securities are then screened for industry sector classification; thus, the eligible securities are ranked according to GICS. Then, the Index components, now determined, are weighted on the basis of SPDJI’s float-adjusted, market
capitalization methodology. Generally, SPDJI observes a prospective constituent’s liquidity over a period of at least six months before consideration for inclusion. However, there may be extraordinary situations when issuers should be added
immediately (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, certain privatizations). When a particular issuer dominates its home market, it may be excluded from an Index if analysis of the
sectors reveals that its securities are not as liquid as those of similar issuers in other countries. Once a year, the float adjustments will be reviewed and potentially changed based on such review. The values of an Index’s constituents are
adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The market capitalization of index constituent issuers is adjusted for all strategic holdings, including
private, corporate, and government holdings.</font></div> <div>With
respect to the non-U.S. components of the S&amp;P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of index components that are considered for inclusion are from the following S&amp;P DJI Indices: (i) the S&amp;P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock Exchange), which
represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Canadian equities market; (ii) the S&amp;P/TOPIX 150 (Tokyo Stock Exchange) which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly-listed issuers in the Japanese
equities market; (iii) S&amp;P/ASX All-Australian 50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the Australian equities market; (iv) the S&amp;P Asia 50, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of four
major equities markets in Asia (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore); (v) the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks from major sectors of the Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Chilé equity markets;
and (vi) the S&amp;P Europe 350, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the region, covering approximately 70% of the region’s market capitalization.</div>
<div>Issue Changes. <font>General
oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to these
investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the various regional equity markets and, in some cases, with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements of index
changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance. <font>Maintaining
the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs. An issuer will be removed
from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as close as possible to the actual date on which the event occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index
because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no longer representative of its industry group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section criteria.</font></div>
<div>When calculating index weights, individual constituents’
shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also excluded regardless of whether they are index constituents. In
countries with regulated environments, where a foreign investment limit exists at the sector or issuer level, the constituent’s weight will reflect either the foreign investment limit or the percentage float, whichever is the more
restrictive.</div> <div>Each issuer’s financial statements
will be used to update the major shareholders’ ownership. However, during the course of the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (“IWF”) which is SPDJI’s term for the mathematical float
factor used to calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (<font>i.e.</font>, privatization, merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than 5%, a
float adjustment will be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Changes in the number of shares outstanding driven by
corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less than 5% are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday
near the end of the calendar quarter. Generally, index changes due to rebalancing are announced two days before the effective date by way of a news release posted on <font>www.us.spindices.com.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The
S&amp;P Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</font></div>
<div>Exchange Rates. <font>SPDJI uses the
World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time for the following funds: iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF and iShares Latin America 40 ETF. Prior to January 31, 2013, SPDJI
used the currency exchange (FX) rate corresponding to 5:15 p.m. Eastern time (with the exception of iShares Asia 50 ETF). In case World Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New
Year’s Day), the previous business day’s rates are normally used. SPDJI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. SPDJI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the
World Markets/Reuters rates are not available, or if SPDJI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances for a given currency on a particular day.</font></div>

<div>Investment Restrictions</div>
<div>The Board has adopted as fundamental policies the following
numbered investment restrictions, which cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined
in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50%
of outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund has also adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental investment policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.
Therefore, each Fund may change its investment objective and its Underlying Index without shareholder approval.</div>

<div>Notations Regarding the iShares International Dividend Growth
ETF’s Fundamental Investment Restrictions</div> <div>The
following notations are not considered to be part of the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF's fundamental investment restrictions and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their
activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF's industry classifications,
the Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad
authority to the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing
money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the
Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The iShares International Dividend Growth ETF’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company
Act requires the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of the iShares International Dividend
Growth ETF's total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading
practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when
the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark liquid assets,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>43</div> </div> </div> <div>
</div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<a name="aee3b13f-97d9-414c-97bd-415d273ee51e_44"> </a> <div> <a href="#sai_toc">
 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the
Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be interpreted to permit the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF to engage in trading
practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit the Fund to segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions in
accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and
investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of
diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of the iShares International Dividend Growth
ETF's underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the Fund’s investments in issuers where the Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions
involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause the iShares
International Dividend Growth ETF to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities,
regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than
one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures
transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>
<div>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
<div>iShares International Dividend Growth ETF</div>
<div>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make
short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by the Fund’s Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</div>
<div>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under the
Fund’s fundamental or non-fundamental investment restrictions apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of the Fund’s assets invested in certain securities or other instruments resulting from
market fluctuations or other changes in the Fund’s total assets will not require the Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax
consequences.</div> <div>All Funds Other Than the iShares
International Dividend Growth ETF</div> <div>Each Fund has adopted
a non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid security, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, which currently permits up to
15% of each Fund’s net assets to be invested in illiquid securities (calculated at the time of investment).</div>
<div>BFA monitors the liquidity of restricted securities in each
Fund's (other than the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF's) portfolio. In reaching liquidity decisions, BFA considers the following factors:</div> <div>
<table>

<div>If any percentage restriction described above is complied with
at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that certain percentage limitations will be observed continuously in
accordance with applicable law.</div> <div>All Funds</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in
accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of the Underlying Index or in depositary
receipts representing component securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the
80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund (except the iShares India 50 ETF) has adopted a
non-fundamental limitation such that, under normal market conditions, any borrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's net assets.</div>
<div>Each Fund may not purchase securities of other investment
companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G)
(the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</div>
<div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon
request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div>

<div>The Board has concluded that, based on each Trustee’s
experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, each Trustee should serve as a Trustee of the Board. Among the attributes common to all Trustees are their ability to review
critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the Funds' investment adviser, other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective
business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. A Trustee’s ability to perform his or her duties effectively may have been attained through the Trustee’s educational background or professional training; business,
consulting, public service or academic positions; experience from service as a Board member of the Funds and the other funds in the Trust (and any predecessor funds), other investment funds, public companies, or non-profit entities or other
organizations; and/or other life experiences. Also, set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Trustee that led the Board to conclude that he or she should serve (or continue to

<div><font>Board –
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business
and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing
Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing
Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure.
The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and
the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses
key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review
risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal
counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment
performance or other activities.</div> <div>Committees of the Board
of Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), John E. Kerrigan and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist
the Board (i) in its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight of the Trust's financial statements and the
independent audit thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); (iv) in
evaluating the independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and independent audits; and
(vi) to assume such other responsibilities as may be delegated by the Board. The Audit Committee met six times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.</font></div>
<div>The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are
John E. Kerrigan (Chair), Madhav V. Rajan and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Nominating and Governance Committee nominates individuals for Independent Trustee membership on the Board and recommends appointments to the
Advisory Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee functions include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) reviewing the qualifications of any person properly identified or nominated to serve as an Independent Trustee; (ii) recommending
to the Board and current Independent Trustees the nominee(s) for appointment as an Independent Trustee by the Board and current Independent Trustees and/or for election as Independent Trustees by shareholders to fill any vacancy for a position of
Independent Trustee(s) on the Board; (iii) recommending to the Board and current Independent Trustees the size and composition of the Board and Board committees and whether they comply with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) recommending a
current Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Board's retirement policy; and (vi) recommending an appropriate level of
compensation for the Independent Trustees for their services as Trustees, members or chairpersons of committees of the Board, Board Chair and any other positions as the Nominating and Governance Committee considers appropriate. The Nominating and
Governance Committee does not consider Board nominations recommended by shareholders (acting solely in their capacity as a shareholder and not in any other capacity). The Nominating and Governance Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2018.</div> <div>Each Independent Trustee serves on the
15(c) Committee. The Chair of the 15(c) Committee is Drew E. Lawton. The principal responsibilities of the 15(c) Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for the annual review and renewal of the Trust's
advisory and sub-advisory agreements. These responsibilities include: (i) meeting with BlackRock, Inc. in advance of the Board meeting at which the Trust's advisory and sub-advisory agreements are to be considered to discuss generally the process
for providing requested information to the Board and the format in which information will be provided; and (ii) considering and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to
evaluate the investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements of the Trust. The 15(c) Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.</div>
<div>The members of the Securities Lending Committee are John E.
Martinez (Chair), Jane D. Carlin and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The principal responsibilities of the Securities Lending Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for oversight of
the Trust's securities lending activities. These responsibilities include: (i) requesting that certain information be provided to the Committee for its review and consideration prior to such information being provided to the Board; (ii) considering
and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to oversee the Trust's securities lending activities and make required findings and approvals; and (iii) providing a
recommendation to the Board regarding the annual approval of the Trust's Securities Lending Guidelines and the required findings with respect to, and annual approval of, the Trust's agreement with the securities lending agent. The Securities Lending
Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.</div>

performance and related matters for equity funds. These responsibilities include: (i) reviewing quarterly reports regarding Trust performance, secondary market trading and changes in net assets to identify any matters that should be brought to the
attention of the Board; and (ii) considering any performance or investment related matters as may be delegated to the Committee by the Board from time to time and providing a report or recommendation to the Board as appropriate. The Equity Plus

BlackRock, Inc. and the other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to in this section as “BlackRock”) and PNC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this section as the “Entities”), and their
respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management
firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, including, in the case
of BlackRock, the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and
alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may
be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock and the Entities have proprietary interests in, and
may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types
of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock and Entities are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary
basis. As such, BlackRock and Entities are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities,
currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's
transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Fund.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of
the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies
of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research
or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund,
market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged.
BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it
might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> <div>Conflicts
may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short
by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its
other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could
result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and redemptions, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund
participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities and their respective clients may
pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of the Fund's investments may be negatively impacted
by the activities of BlackRock or the Entities or their respective clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or
advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or
more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Entities or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or an Entity for clients
worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and the Entities designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain
securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Entities are performing services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock or one or more Entities for their
proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual
issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div> <div>In connection
with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in
accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed by
them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities
or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or an Entity, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or an Entity, serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases,
such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the
purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or an Entity.</div>
<div>BlackRock or one or more Entities may also create, write or
issue derivatives for their clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the
index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock will receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging
to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. Other funds and accounts managed by
BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased
payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock or one or more Entities and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock or an Entity where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the
Fund.</div> <div>At times, these activities may cause business
units or entities within BlackRock or an Entity to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock and/or Entities
on an arm’s-length basis.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock or one
or more Entities may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, underwriting and placement fees, sales fees,
financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock or an Entity will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock and each Entity, including its sales
personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock or the Entity and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds also may use an index provider that is
affiliated with another service provider of the Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock and the Entities (and
their personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to
the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock or an Entity of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock or an Entity acts as broker, dealer, agent,
adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock or the Entity may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships
with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's
counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate pro-rata allocation.</div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to
approximate pro-rata allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.</font>,
indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when
aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal
opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by
the firm.</div> <div>Purchases and sales of securities and other
assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different</div> </div>

<div>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch
or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers
(including, without limitation, certain Entities) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in
BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by
law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or
other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the
research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client
accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate
benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for
those products and services itself.</div> <div>BlackRock does not
currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular
broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to
pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such
arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in
the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where
permitted, an Entity, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many
of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</div>
<div>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks
(“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or an Entity has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions for certain types of
securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and
markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain
circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or
an Entity, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed
discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div>
<div>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock or an
Entity may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to
reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the Entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of
a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or an Entity could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment
flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other shareholders in deciding whether to redeem its shares
but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or
engage in transactions with, companies with which an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests or in which an Entity makes a market. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such
issuances. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies to which an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. Such investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of
a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other clients of BlackRock or an Entity. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of
these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock or an Entity may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. When an Entity is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution of securities of an
entity, BlackRock may be prohibited from purchasing or recommending the purchase of certain securities of that entity for a Fund. As indicated below, BlackRock or an Entity may engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds
or other clients of BlackRock or of an Entity have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), a public
company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has
representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co
participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co
transaction.</div> <div>BlackRock and the Entities, their personnel
and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and the Entities and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other
products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and the Entities and their sales personnel may directly or indirectly
receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than
for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock or the Entities and such personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability
resulting from other funds or products.</div> <div>Third parties,
including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other
professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services
to a Fund.</div> <div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to
certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors,
especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information</div> </div>

<div>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there
may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are
valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability
to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party
valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
by BlackRock (pursuant to Board-adopted procedures) at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for
which it receives an asset-based fee.</div> <div>To the extent
permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to the extent
permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy
and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be
taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and
BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information
regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by
e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div> <div>BlackRock will not
purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated with a Fund
as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be
appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted
because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to
some of those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for
which BlackRock or an Entity is performing investment banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock
may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or
sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that
are issued by such companies, are the subject of an underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Entity, or are the subject of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or
officers of the issuer.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The investment activities of BlackRock for their proprietary
accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in
certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their
proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer
disadvantages or business restrictions.</div> <div>If certain
aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or
exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict,
forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the
creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div> <div>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use
the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using
BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to any Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a
license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds’ custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as
having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not
intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a
stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>

<div>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. To the
extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions may accrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain
trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and
funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to
BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) to be one of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders
for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development partner, BlackRock has licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. Once the ICE Platform is launched, BlackRock intends to use the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and
redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues
earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s intellectual property to ICE and for BlackRock’s role as development partner. ICE Data Services, the underlying index provider for certain of the Funds, is a wholly owned subsidiary
of ICE.</div> <div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service
provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>A Fund from time to time may purchase in the secondary market
(i) certain mortgage pass-through securities packaged and master serviced by PNC Mortgage Securities Corp. (“PNC Mortgage”) or Midland Loan Services, Inc. (“Midland”), or (ii) mortgage-related securities containing loans or
mortgages originated by PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) or its affiliates. It is possible that under some circumstances, PNC Mortgage, Midland or other affiliates could have interests that are in conflict with the holders of
these mortgage-backed securities, and such holders could have rights against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates. For example, if PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates engaged in negligence or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties
as a master servicer, then any holder of the mortgage-backed security could seek recourse against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable. Also, as a master servicer, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may make certain
representations and warranties regarding the quality of the mortgages and properties underlying a mortgage-backed security. If one or more of those representations or warranties is false, then the holders of the mortgage backed securities could
trigger an obligation of PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable, to repurchase the mortgages from the issuing trust. Finally, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may own securities that are subordinate to the senior
mortgage-backed securities owned by a Fund.</div> <div>Present and
future activities of BlackRock (including BFA) and the Entities and their respective directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</div>

June 16, 2016, investors (the “Plaintiffs”) in certain iShares funds (iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF,
iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares Select Dividend ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF, iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF and iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF) filed a putative class
action lawsuit against the Trust, BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its advisory affiliates, and certain directors/trustees and officers of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”) in California State Court. The lawsuit alleges the Defendants
violated federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose in the prospectuses issued by the funds noted above the risks of using stop-loss orders in the event of a “flash crash,” such as the one that occurred on May 6, 2010. On
September 18, 2017, the court issued a Statement of Decision holding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims. On October 11, 2017, the court entered final judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.

<div>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution
Services</div> <div>Investment Adviser. <font> BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and
is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund,
manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from
time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In
addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation
arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement,
for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes,
expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses
(as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</div>
<div>The following describes the calculation of the management fee
for each Fund whose management fee is subject to breakpoints. The management fee for all Funds is set forth in the table that follows the description of breakpoints.</div>
<div>For its investment advisory services to the iShares Global
Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF and iShares Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund corresponding to the Fund’s allocable portion of an aggregate management fee
calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds: iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global
Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares Global Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Industrials ETF, iShares Global Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global Materials
ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF, iShares Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF, iShares Global Utilities ETF, iShares North American Natural Resources ETF, iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF. The
aggregate management fee for the iShares funds listed above is calculated as follows: 0.48% per annum of the aggregate net assets of those Funds less than or equal to $10.0 billion, plus 0.43% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $10.0
billion, up to and including $20.0 billion, plus 0.38% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $20.0 billion.</div>
<div>For its investment advisory services to the iShares Latin
America 40 ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds: iShares Latin America 40 ETF, iShares MSCI Pacific ex Japan ETF, iShares Preferred and Income
Securities ETF, iShares Russell 2000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF and iShares Select Dividend ETF. The management fee for the Fund equals the ratio of the Fund’s net assets over the aggregate net assets
of the above iShares funds multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.5000% per annum of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $46.0 billion, plus 0.4750% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $46.0 billion, up to and including
$81.0 billion, plus 0.4513% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $81.0 billion, up to an including $111.0 billion, plus 0.4287% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $111.0 billion, up to and including $141.0 billion, plus 0.4073% per
annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $141.0 billion.</div>
<div>The following table sets forth the management fee at the
annual rate (as a percentage of each Fund's average daily net assets) BFA received from each Fund for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and the management fees (net of waivers) each Fund paid BFA for the fiscal years noted:</div> </div>

for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management seeks to track the rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics of independent third-party indexes by either replicating the same combination of
securities and other financial instruments that constitute those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that constitute those indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to
BFA’s policy, investment opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal
constraints or other factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time each Fund may
receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than it would have if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may
pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio’s or
account’s gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or any of its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an
incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees.
Although BFA and each of its affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intend to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and

<div>The discussion below describes the Portfolio Managers'
compensation as of March 31, 2018.</div> <div>Portfolio Manager
Compensation Overview</div> <div>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial
arrangements with its portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year to
year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established
by BlackRock, Inc.</div> <div>Base compensation.<font> Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.</font></div>
<div>Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, Inc. and the individual's performance and
contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock, Inc.</font></div>
<div>Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. The BlackRock, Inc. restricted
stock units, if properly vested, will be settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Typically, the cash bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of total compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying a portion of annual
bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given year “at risk” based on BlackRock, Inc.'s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods.</font></div>
<div>Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards — <font>From time to time, long-term incentive equity awards are granted to certain key employees to aid in retention, align their interests with long-term shareholder interests and motivate performance. Equity awards are
generally granted in the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units that, once vested, settle in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.</font></div>
<div>Other Compensation Benefits.<font>
In addition to base compensation and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:</font></div>
<div>Incentive Savings Plans<font>
— BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock, Inc. employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“RSP”), and the BlackRock Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution
equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) limit ($275,000 for 2018). The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies and collective investment funds
managed by the firm. BlackRock, Inc. contributions follow the investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into an index target date fund that corresponds to, or is
closest to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock, Inc. common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to
the purchase of 1,000 shares of common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the Purchase Date. Rachel Aguirre, Diane Hsiung, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw are each eligible to participate in
these plans.</font></div> <div>As of March 31, 2018, the Portfolio
Managers did not beneficially own shares of the Funds.</div>
<div>Codes of Ethics. <font> The
Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, including securities
that may be purchased or held by the Funds. The codes of ethics are on public file with, and are available from, the SEC.</font></div>
<div>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. <font> The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism or other
illicit activities. Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information
will be used to verify the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font></div> </div>

<div>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from

in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units
</font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50
U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>

(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own
resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it
receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) the iShares Global Tech ETF
(“Domestic Equity Fund”) retained 71.5% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 65% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.
Effective January 1, 2019, (i) domestic equity funds, such as the Domestic Equity Fund, retain 73.5% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities
lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div> <div>Through
December 31, 2018, (i) all Funds except for the iShares Global Tech ETF (“International Equity Funds”) retained 80% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than
70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Effective January 1, 2019, (i) international equity funds, such as the International Equity Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral
investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are
categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is
based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the business day following the date
that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable Fund, pursuant to the securities lending agreement, will receive for the remainder of that calendar year securities
lending income as follows:</div> <div>Domestic Equity Fund</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) 75% of securities lending
income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 65% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Effective January 1, 2019, (i) 80% of securities lending income (which
excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of the securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>

related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or
indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded
products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting
systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing
Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise promote
the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities
believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</div>
<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your
salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localizes the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries
and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, FDx Advisors, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann Advisor
Network LLC, LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Advisors Services, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc. and UBS Financial
Services Inc. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed above. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an
amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or
maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA
Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives</font></div> </div>

secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive
program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate
in such programs.</div> <div>Determination of Net Asset
Value</div> <div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of securities held by a Fund is as
follows:</font></div> <div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities
exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each, an “Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price on the
Exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain
circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that
there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures approved by the Board (the “Valuation
Procedures”), BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments.
<font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing
services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot
size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days
or less remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as
obtained from independent third-party pricing services. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the
entity, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In
the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of
such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair
value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated
prices)</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services,
each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are
valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or
that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a
greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service
providers.</font></div> <div>All cash, receivables and current
payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their face value.</div>
<div>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services,
broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or
updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and
circumstances surrounding the revision.</div> <div>In the event
that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance
with a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the Board or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the
date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers.</div>
<div>Certain of the securities acquired by a Fund may be traded on
foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized Participants can neither purchase nor redeem shares of a
Fund.</div> <div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S.
government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of a Fund
are determined as of such times.</div> <div>Use of fair value
prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s
performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Fair Value.<font> When market
quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BlackRock in accordance with the
Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack of
trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies
significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to
the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred
after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of the assets or liabilities held
by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the markets or in related or highly correlated assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
ADRs, GDRs or ETFs that invest in components of the Underlying Index) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the
primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that would cause
such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock, with input from the BlackRock Investment Strategy
Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In
addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values
assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on
which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to
maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values
determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis
of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and
assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the
valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or
liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating
to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the
determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become more stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn
increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In</div> </div>

<div>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission
than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or
instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the
reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their
ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, less liquid securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>The Funds
anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of depositary
receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., will
be subject to negotiated commission rates.</div> <div>OTC issues,
including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds
will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will
generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds
will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by
the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x)
such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of
another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client
for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal,
trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>IPOs of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently
trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client accounts is often less than the amount
of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s
trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for particular client accounts that are
managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international equity securities, the country
where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a
<font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations of securities
will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate
such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be
used as well.</div> <div>Because different accounts may have
differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For example, BFA may decide that
it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates during the same period may
increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may decrease the market price
of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients or funds for which BFA or
another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to

are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the
price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may
deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA,
in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable
transactions. The Funds will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as

<div>The portfolio turnover for iShares International Dividend
Growth ETF relates to the period of May 17, 2016 to March 31, 2017 and is not annualized.</div>
<div>Creation or redemption transactions, to the extent consisting
of cash, may require the Funds to contemporaneously transact with broker-dealers for purchases of Deposit Securities (as defined below under <font>Fund Deposit</font>) or sales of Fund Securities (as defined below under <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font>), as applicable. Such transactions with a particular broker-dealer may be conditioned upon the broker-dealers agreement to transact at guaranteed price levels in order to reduce
transaction costs the Funds would otherwise incur as a consequence of settling creation or redemption baskets in cash rather than in-kind.<br/> </div>
<div>Following the Funds' receipt of an order to purchase or redeem
creation or redemption baskets, to the extent such purchases or redemptions consist of a cash portion, the Funds will enter an order with a broker or dealer to purchase or sell the Deposit Securities or Fund Securities, as applicable. The terms of
such order may, depending on the timing of the transaction and certain other factors, require the broker or dealer to guarantee that the Funds will achieve execution of their order at a price at least as favorable to the Funds as the Funds'
valuation of the Deposit Securities/Fund Securities used for purposes of calculating the NAV applied to the creation or redemption transactions giving rise to the orders (the “Execution Performance Guarantee”). Such orders may be placed
with the purchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant in its capacity as a broker-dealer, with its affiliated broker-dealer or with a third-party broker-dealer. The amount payable to the Funds in respect of any Execution Performance Guarantee will
depend on the results achieved by the executing firm and will vary depending on market activity, timing and a variety of other factors.<br/> </div>
<div>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be
honored on orders arising from creation transactions executed by an Authorized Participant or its affiliate as broker-dealer, an Authorized Participant is required to deposit an amount with the Funds (the “Execution Performance
Deposit”). If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price equal to or more favorable than the Funds' valuation of the Deposit Securities, the Funds receive the benefit of the favorable executions
and returns to the Authorized Participant the Execution Performance Deposit. If, however, the broker-dealer executing the order is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to the Funds' valuation of the
securities, the Funds retain the portion of the Execution Performance Deposit equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes, brokerage, commissions or other costs) and may require the Authorized Participant to deposit any
additional amount required to cover the full amount of the actual Execution Performance Guarantee.<br/> </div>
<div>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be
honored for brokerage orders arising from redemption transactions executed by an Authorized Participant or its affiliate as broker-dealer, an Authorized Participant agrees to pay the shortfall amount (the “Execution Performance Offset”).
If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price equal to or more favorable than the Funds' valuation of the Fund Securities, the Funds receive the benefit of the favorable executions and the Authorized
Participant is not called upon to honor the Execution Performance Offset. If, however, the broker-dealer is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to the Funds' valuation of the securities, the Funds will be
entitled to the portion of the Execution Performance Offset equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes, brokerage commissions or other costs).<br/> </div>
<div>The circumstances under which the Execution Performance
Guarantee will be used and the expected amount, if any, of any Execution Performance Deposit or Execution Performance Offset for the Funds will be disclosed in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time
based on the actual experience of the Funds.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</div>
<div>Shares.<font>  The Trust
currently consists of more than 280 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font></div>
<div>Each share issued by a fund has a <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and
distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the
shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees
determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an
annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative
voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of
shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of
time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,
c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> <div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain
funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a Fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such Fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares
are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination
of the Trust or a Fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a Fund may make
redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a Fund, the Trust or a Fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for
shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is</div> </div>

<div>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold
preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain
a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants,
Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may
decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust
shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling
Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the
OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected
through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit
size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><sup>1</sup><font> The approximate value per creation unit for the iShares Global Healthcare ETF is as of May 2,
2018.</font></div> <div>In its discretion, the Trust reserves the
right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a corresponding change
in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>
<div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The
consideration for purchase of Creation Units of each Fund (except for the iShares India 50 ETF, which is generally offered in Creation Units solely for cash) generally consists of Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described
below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with a Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile similar
to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit
and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing a Creation Unit.</div>
<div>The iShares India 50 ETF’s current policy is to accept
cash in substitution for the Deposit Securities it might otherwise accept as in-kind consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. The Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit Securities (<font>i.e</font>.,</div>

<div>the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash
Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. If the Fund elects to accept Deposit Securities, a purchaser’s delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the Cash Component will constitute the “Fund Deposit,”
which will represent the consideration for a Creation Unit of the Fund. All other Funds discussed in this SAI generally offer Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash. Please see the <font>Cash Purchase Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for further information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC on each Business Day
prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number of shares of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the
end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of the Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made
available.</div> <div>The identity and number of shares of the
Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The
composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to permit or require the
substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not be eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing
process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including
circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or in certain other situations. As noted above, Creation Units of the iShares India 50 ETF
currently are available only for cash purchases. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method.
<font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund (Creation
Units of the iShares India 50 ETF are generally offered solely for cash, while Creation Units of all other Funds in this SAI are generally offered partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases
thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required
to be paid by an in-kind purchaser. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for cash purchases, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain
brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section of this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of
DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor (an “Authorized Participant”). Such Authorized
Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in
advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the net asset value of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees
described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who
are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed
an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in
additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The
Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to
transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its
Authorized Participant Agreement.</div> <div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m.,
Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and
requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for
a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant
should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a
weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or
its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the
facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance
with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> <div>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon
the next determination of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance to
the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Each Fund reserves the absolute right to reject or revoke a
creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the
Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit
would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii) circumstances outside the control of the
Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of
its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur
any liability for failure to give such notification.</div> <div>In
addition, the iShares India 50 ETF may exercise its right to reject any creation order for shares of the Fund on any Business Day that is a holiday in the Indian market, but not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market, and certain other
holidays during the settlement cycle for Fund shares, in order to protect Fund shareholders from any dilutive costs that may be associated with the purchase of Deposit Securities in connection with creation orders on such days.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. For the iShares Asia 50 ETF, iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF, iShares
India 50 ETF and iShares Latin America 40 ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade
date). For the iShares Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF and iShares International Dividend Growth ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+3 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, three Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate
under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules (as discussed in
Appendix B of this SAI), to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the
last day the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the
Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 115%,
which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy Deposit Securities
for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The cash collateral
posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for
collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant
to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div>
<div>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and
redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions
are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund
and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer, processing and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged on
each Creation Unit created by an Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard creation transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, but may be
reduced by each Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the creation are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a purchase consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an additional
transaction charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the creation transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized
Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial
intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>If a purchase consists of a cash portion and each Fund places
a brokerage transaction to purchase portfolio securities with the Authorized Participant or its affiliated broker-dealer, the Authorized Participant (or its affiliated broker-dealer) may be required, in its capacity as broker-dealer with respect to
that transaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the <font>Brokerage Transactions</font> section of this
SAI.</div> <div>Redemption of Creation Units. <font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on a
Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors
should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the
secondary market.</font></div> <div>The iShares India 50 ETF
generally redeems Creation Units solely for cash. However, the Fund reserves the right to distribute securities in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. All other Funds discussed in this SAI generally redeem Creation Units partially for
cash. However, the Funds reserve the right to distribute securities and other portfolio instruments in kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and
the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>With respect to each Fund, BFA makes available through the
NSCC, prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange on each Business Day, the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be applicable (subject to
possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the

<div>applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund until
such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures
and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund,
the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a
redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a Fund
Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized
Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the
event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The iShares India 50 ETF
generally redeems Creation Units generally for cash. All other Funds discussed in this SAI generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of
securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified
(</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the iShares India 50 ETF are generally redeemed solely for cash, while Creation Units of all other Funds in this SAI are
generally redeemed partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund
Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for
cash redemptions, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the
</font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section of this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer, processing and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged on each
Creation Unit redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard redemption transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, but may be
reduced by each Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the redemption are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a redemption consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an additional
transaction charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the redemption transaction. Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their
account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for
such services.</font></div> <div>The following table sets forth

places a brokerage transaction to sell portfolio securities with the Authorized Participant or its affiliated broker-dealer, the Authorized Participant (or its affiliated broker-dealer) may be required, in its capacity as broker-dealer with respect

this SAI.</div> <div>Placement of Redemption Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable request to redeem
shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed earlier
that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized
Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The Authorized
Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their particular
broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant
Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors should
allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any
Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor
within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div> <div>For
the iShares Asia 50 ETF, iShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares Global Tech ETF and iShares Latin America 40 ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within
two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). For the iShares Global Timber &amp; Forestry ETF, iShares India 50 ETF and iShares International Dividend Growth ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are
generally made within three Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>“T+3”). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle
redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption
transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules (as discussed in Appendix B to this SAI), to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and
dividend ex-dates (<font>i.e.</font>, the last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain other circumstances. Appendix B of this SAI
identifies the instances, if any, where more than seven days would be needed to deliver redemption proceeds. Pursuant to an order of the SEC, the Trust will make delivery of redemption proceeds within the number of days stated in Appendix B of this
SAI to be the maximum number of days necessary to deliver redemption proceeds.</div>
<div>If neither the redeeming Beneficial Owner nor the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible
to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such
case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and
additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal
and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or
cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions
of Creation Units (except that, as noted above, Creation Units of each Fund generally will be redeemed partially for cash, with the exception Creation Units of the iShares India 50 ETF, which generally will be redeemed for cash), in the event that
cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter, except for the instances listed
in Appendix B to this SAI in which more than seven calendar days would be needed).</div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's
agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the
missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash, in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds, having a value at least equal to 105%
and up to 115%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing shares. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the day after the date of
submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the
Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. The Authorized
Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the
Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on
exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when
the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of
payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is
suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an</div> </div> <div type="Block">

or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were
held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div>
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a
Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and, without further legislation, will not apply after 2025. The application of certain provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on a
Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. In addition, legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on their investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual gross income
must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or
forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships
(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at
least 90% of their income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total
assets must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater
than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S.
government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or
businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of
its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable</div> </div>

<div>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure,
that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal
Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may
result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A Fund will be
subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its
taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such
income or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than
two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the
aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div>
<div>Excise Tax.<font>  A Fund will
be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12
months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by year-end. In addition, the
minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute
dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero or until their respective expiration dates, whichever occurs
first. Capital loss carryforwards from taxable years beginning after 2010 are not subject to expiration, and short-term and long-term capital loss carryforwards from such taxable years may only be applied against net realized short-term and
long-term capital gains, respectively.</font></div> <div>In the
event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div>
<div>The following Funds had net capital loss carryforwards, as set
forth in the table below, as of March 31, 2018, the tax year-end for the Funds:</div> <div>

of U.S. Shareholders.<font>   Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made.
However, any dividend or distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on
December 31 of such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount
equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event,
the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares
of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their
credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b).
Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or
claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div>Distributions of net
realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other
dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified
dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of
capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving
cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (a) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e.</font>, the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares. <font> Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the
second acquisition. This provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s
basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to
market value. It is not</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a
case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for
purposes of the 80% determination.</div> <div>Taxation of Certain
Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to
the extent permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of
gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the
Fund and defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which
to pay dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a
RIC.</font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in so-called
“Section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All Section 1256 contracts
held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value
at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets and
were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term
capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income
or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund
may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</div>
<div>Qualified Dividend Income.
<font> Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend
income, which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is,
in general, dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, non-U.S.
corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S.
(where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada,
China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,
Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</font></div>
<div>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified
dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with
respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding

<div>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with
respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to
treat such dividend as investment income under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by such REIT or other RIC. In addition, the Tax Act permits a direct REIT shareholder to claim a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, but does not
permit a RIC paying dividends attributable to such income to pass through this special treatment to its shareholders. Unless future legislation or regulations provide for a pass-through, investors in such a RIC will treat such distributions as
ordinary dividend income, as under prior law, whereas a direct REIT investor would benefit from the special treatment. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the
shareholder as ordinary income. Distributions by a Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</div>
<div>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum holding
period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain preference dividends) during which risk of loss may not be
diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to the
investment.</font></div> <div>Issues Related to India and Mauritius

through the Subsidiary. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Subsidiary has elected to be treated as an entity disregarded from its owner. Thus, for U.S. federal tax purposes, any income or loss realized by the Subsidiary will be treated as
realized by the applicable fund . Therefore, any investment made by each Fund into the Subsidiary and any distributions received by the Fund from the Subsidiary are disregarded for U.S. federal tax purposes. Furthermore, there is no tax on each
Fund's investment in the Subsidiary or on distributions made from the Subsidiary to the Fund .</div>
<div>No investor in the iShares India 50 ETF will be subject to
taxation in India unless such investor is a resident of India or, if a non-resident, has an Indian source income or income received (whether accrued or otherwise) in India or triggers the indirect transfer provisions (discussed below). The IT Act
provides for the concept of POEM for the determination of the residency of a foreign company. Accordingly, a company would be said to be resident in India if its POEM is situated in India. POEM is defined as a place where the key management and
commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made. The taxation of the Subsidiary and the Fund in India is governed by the provisions of the IT Act, read with the provisions of the
DTAA. As per Section 90(2) of the IT Act, the provisions of the IT Act would apply to the extent they are more beneficial than the provisions of the DTAA. In order to claim the beneficial provisions of the DTAA, the Subsidiary must be a tax resident
of Mauritius.</div> <div>An investor is required to submit a TRC as
issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and information as prescribed by the Government to claim benefits under the DTAA.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary has been incorporated in Mauritius and has
obtained its TRC from the Mauritius authorities that establishes its residency in Mauritius under the DTAA. The TRC must be renewed annually. The iShares India 50 ETF expects the Subsidiary to maintain its Mauritius tax residency, but it cannot be
assured that the Mauritius authorities will successfully renew its TRC annually or that it will continue to be eligible to the DTAA benefits, particularly in light of the new requirements that may be introduced if the DTAA is re-negotiated.</div>

<div>The Subsidiary holds a Category 1 Global Business License
issued by the Financial Services Commission of Mauritius. The Subsidiary is subject to tax in Mauritius on its net income at the rate of 15%. However, a system of foreign tax credits which allows a tax credit against Mauritian taxes for foreign tax
on a Mauritian entity’s foreign source income effectively reduces the Mauritius income tax rate to a maximum of 3% because the system presumes, in the absence of evidence, that the foreign tax paid is equal to 80% of the Mauritian tax.
Further, the Subsidiary is not subject to capital gains tax in Mauritius nor is it subject to tax in Mauritius on any gains from the sale of securities. Any dividends paid by the Subsidiary to the iShares India 50 ETF will also be exempt from tax in
Mauritius.</div> <div>The DTAA gives India the right to tax capital
gains that arise from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident. However, the DTAA also provides for grandfathering of investments in shares made before April 1, 2017. Returns from investments in shares made on
or after April 1, 2017 will be subject to capital gains tax in India, although the DTAA provides for a limitation of benefits provision which shall be a prerequisite for a reduced rate of tax (50% of domestic tax rate) on capital gains arising
during a two year transition period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary will attempt to abide by the requirements of
the DTAA, to maintain its residency in Mauritius, and to ensure that management and control of the Subsidiary remain in Mauritius. Any change in the applicability of the provisions of the DTAA or in its applicability to the Subsidiary could result
in the Subsidiary and indirectly the iShares India 50 ETF being subject to Indian income taxes, withholding taxes, and other taxes, as well as being subject to administrative or judicial assertion of such tax liabilities by the tax authorities of
India. This could significantly reduce the return of the Fund on its investments in shares and the return received by Fund shareholders.</div>
<div>The Subsidiary is expected to have income in the form of
capital gains, income from dividends and income from interest. The Indian tax consequences for the Subsidiary on account of the application of the DTAA, read with the provisions of the IT Act, would be as follows (the rates are inclusive of the
highest applicable surcharges):</div> <div>

<div>Indian Minimum Alternate Tax</div>
<div>The question of whether foreign companies (which would include
FIIs) are liable for MAT has been a subject matter of controversy in India. Under the MAT provisions, in the event a company’s tax liability is less than 18.5% of its book profits, then instead of paying income tax at rates provided otherwise
under the IT Act, the company is liable to pay MAT on the adjusted book profits at the rate of 21.55% (inclusive of applicable taxes and surcharges, assuming total income of more than INR 100 million).</div>

<div>The foregoing is based upon current interpretation and
practice and is subject to future changes in the tax laws of India or Mauritius and in the DTAA. Any change in the DTAA's application could have a material adverse effect on the returns of the iShares India 50 ETF. Further, it is possible that the
Indian tax authorities may seek to take the position that the Fund is not entitled to the benefits of the DTAA.</div>
<div>Indirect Transfers</div>
<div>The current legislation imposes Indian tax and withholding
obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (indirect transfers). It has been clarified that Indian tax authorities will not reopen any
assessment proceedings that were completed before April 1, 2012 and where no notice for reassessment has been issued prior to that date. The CBDT also clarified that any assessment or any other order which stands validated due to the amendments in
the Finance Act would be enforced. Given this clarification issued by the CBDT, the Funds does not expect that shareholders or the Funds will become subject to tax or to withholding obligations with respect to completed assessments.</div>
<div>It has been clarified that the share or interest of the
foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the value of all the assets owned by the foreign entity.
The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, of such an asset without reduction of liabilities. The fair market value will be determined in accordance with the Rule 11UB of the IT Rules. It has been provided that
where all the assets of the foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian assets shall be subject to capital gains tax in India.</div>
<div>Further, it provides exemption from indirect transfer
provisions to the small shareholders of such foreign entity in the following cases:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>With respect to a foreign
entity that holds the Indian assets directly, if the transferor of share or interest in such a foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer neither holds the right of control
or management in the foreign entity, nor holds voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in such foreign entity. </td></tr>
<tr>

 </td>
<td>With
respect to a foreign entity that holds the Indian assets indirectly, if the transferor of share or interest in such foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer does not hold
the right of control or management in relation to the foreign entity, which would entitle them to the right of control or management in the foreign entity which directly holds the Indian assets; or does not hold voting power or share capital or
interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in the foreign entity, which results in holding the same share capital or voting power in the entity which directly holds the Indian assets. </td></tr></table>
</div> <div>If the gains arising from transfer of share or interest
in a foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes.</div>
<div>The IT Act provides that aforesaid indirect transfer
provisions will not apply to foreign investors making an investment directly or indirectly in a SEBI registered Category I and Category II foreign portfolio investor.</div>
<div>Under IT Act, gains realized when a non-resident acquires
shares of a foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives “substantial value” from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50% of the
value the company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably attributable to the Indian assets.</div>
<div>Because the Fund invests in Indian securities through the
Subsidiary, the Subsidiary or the Fund may be considered to derive “substantial value” from Indian assets. Accordingly, shareholder redemptions of Fund/Subsidiary shares and sales of Fund shares may have been subject to Indian tax and
withholding obligations. However, the IT Act provides for an exemption to shareholders in Category I and Category II FPI from the applicability of indirect transfer taxation. The Subsidiary is a Category II FPI. Therefore, any redemptions or
transfers by the Fund or the shareholders in the Fund should not be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>General Anti-Avoidance Rules.</div>
<div>The GAAR introduced in the IT Act provides the Indian tax
authorities a mechanism to deny any tax benefits in a transaction or any other arrangement that is believed to not have any commercial substance or purpose other than to obtain tax benefit(s) under a treaty. The provisions of GAAR will be applicable
to arrangements (including a step in or a part thereof) entered into by a taxpayer, which may be declared as an “impermissible avoidance arrangement”.</div>
<div>CBDT has clarified that where a FPI (such as the Subsidiary)
is located in a particular jurisdiction based on non-tax commercial reasons and the main purpose of the choice of location/residence of the FPI is not to obtain a treaty benefit, the GAAR provisions will not be resorted to by the tax
authorities.</div> <div>As per the provisions of the IT Rules, GAAR
shall not apply in the following circumstances:</div> <div>

<div>If the iShares India 50 ETF's use of the Subsidiary were
considered to be such an impermissible avoidance arrangement, the Fund may become subject directly to taxation in India. The burden of proof in enforcing the rule will reside with the Indian government, not the taxpayer, and India’s current
double tax treaty arrangements will remain in force. However, GAAR may, irrespective of existing treaty provisions, lead to the imposition of tax liabilities and withholding obligations, which may lead the Fund to modify the structure.</div>
<div>Recent amendments to DTAA and GAAR could change the manner in
which the Subsidiary are currently taxed in India and could adversely impact the returns to the iShares India 50 ETF/Subsidiary and their respective shareholders. The Funds will continue to monitor developments in India with respect to these
matters. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to their own tax situations and the tax consequences of an investment in each of the Funds.</div>
<div>Excess Inclusion Income.
<font> Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) from being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt
shareholder could realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types
of income received by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to report some or all of its distributions as “excess inclusion income.” To Fund
shareholders, such excess inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain
charitable entities; (ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if
certain “disqualified organizations,” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue
Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Investments.
<font> Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated
in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988
gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and
certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless a
Fund was to elect otherwise.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Each Fund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at
the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to “pass through” to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15
additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not
actually received, the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their deductions
on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.
securities while such securities are lent out by the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not “passed through” for tax purposes will not be available to shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A
non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year that the Fund elects to “pass through” its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the
investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of non-U.S. taxes paid
by a Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain limitations will be
imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a Fund or to treat Fund
dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain circumstances.
Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div>
<div>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. <font> If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed
as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on a Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div>
<div>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC
as a “qualified electing fund” under the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified
electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information
from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to
the Fund.</div> <div>Alternatively, a Fund may make a
mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and would deduct any such losses as
ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By
making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to distribute this “phantom” income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible,
and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effects of these rules.</div>
<div>Reporting. <font> If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Other Taxes. <font> Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div> </div>

<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a
U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>

federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations
of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains”
(generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible
dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a
non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> <div>Distributions that a Fund
reports as “short-term capital gain dividends” or “long-term capital gain dividends” will not be treated as such to a recipient foreign shareholder if the distribution is attributable to gain received from the sale or
exchange of U.S. real property or an interest in a U.S. real property holding corporation and the Fund’s direct or indirect interests in U.S. real property exceeded certain levels. Instead, if the foreign shareholder has not owned more than 5%
of the outstanding shares of a Fund at any time during the one year period ending on the date of distribution, such distributions will be subject to 30% withholding by the Fund and will be treated as ordinary dividends to the foreign shareholder; if
the foreign shareholder owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Fund at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution, such distribution will be treated as real property gain subject to 21% withholding tax
and could subject the foreign shareholder to U.S. filing requirements. Additionally, if a Fund’s direct or indirect interests in U.S. real property were to exceed certain levels, a foreign shareholder realizing gains upon redemption from the
Fund could be subject to the 21% withholding tax and U.S. filing requirements unless more than 50% of the Fund’s shares were owned by U.S. persons at such time or unless the foreign person had not held more than 5% of the Fund’s
outstanding shares throughout either such person’s holding period for the redeemed shares or, if shorter, the previous five years.</div>
<div>The rules laid out in the previous paragraph, other than the
withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund’s participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</div>
<div>Distributions to certain foreign shareholders by a Fund at
least 50% of the assets of which are “U.S. real property interests” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and U.S. Treasury regulations) at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distributions, to the extent
the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations” such as certain REITs, although exceptions may apply if any class
of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distributions), generally must be
treated by such foreign shareholders as income effectively connected to a trade or business within the U.S., which is generally subject to tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, except for distributions to foreign shareholders
that held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the previous one-year period ending on the date of the distributions. Such distributions may be subject to U.S. withholding tax and may require a foreign shareholder to
file a U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, sales or redemptions of shares held by certain foreign shareholders in such a Fund generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax and generally will require the foreign shareholder to file a
U.S. federal income tax return, although exceptions may apply if more than 50% of the value of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fund’s shares are held by U.S. shareholders or the foreign shareholder
selling or redeeming the shares has held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or redemption.</div>
<div>Provided that more than 50% of the value of a Fund’s
stock is held by U.S. shareholders, redemptions and other distributions made in the form of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations”, although exceptions may apply if any class

the Fund to recognize a portion of any unrecognized gain in the U.S. real property interests equal to the product of (i) the excess of fair market value of such U.S. real property interests over the Fund’s adjusted bases in such interests and

institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer
identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA has registered the iShares India 50 ETF for marketing to
investors in Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.</div>
<div>Investors’ Rights.
<font> Each Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, administrator, custodian and transfer agent. Further information about the duties and roles of these service
providers is set out in this SAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund are not parties to the relevant agreement with these service providers and do not have express contractual rights against the Fund or its service providers, except certain
institutional investors that are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under the terms of the relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under
federal or state law against a Fund or its service providers. In the event that an investor considers that it may have a claim against a Fund, or against any service provider in connection with its investment in a Fund, such investor should consult
its own legal advisor.</font></div> <div>By contract, Authorized
Participants irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or U.S. federal court sitting in New York City over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Authorized Participant Agreement.
Jurisdiction over other claims, whether by investors or Authorized Participants, will turn on the facts of the particular case and the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought.</div> </div>

Adviser</div> <div>October 1, 2018</div>
<div>The Boards of Trustees/Directors (“Directors”) of
open-end funds advised by BlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors, LLC (“BlackRock”) (the “Funds”), have the responsibility for the oversight of voting proxies relating to portfolio securities of the Funds, and have
determined that it is in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders to delegate that responsibility to BlackRock, subject to the principles outlined in this Policy, as part of BlackRock’s authority to manage, acquire and dispose of
account assets, all as contemplated by the Funds’ respective investment management agreements.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted guidelines and procedures (together and
as from time to time amended, the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of the Funds on
specific proxy issues in respect of securities held by each such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in accordance with the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines.</div>
<div>BlackRock will report on an annual basis to the Directors on
(1) a summary of all proxy votes that BlackRock has made on behalf of the Funds in the preceding year together with a representation that all votes were in accordance with the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines<sup>1</sup>, and (2) any changes to the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines that have not previously been reported.</div>

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock helps investors build better financial futures. As a
fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies,
asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world.</div>
<div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock’s Investment Stewardship activities are
focused on protecting and enhancing the economic value of the companies in which we invest on behalf of clients. We do this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us authority,
through voting at shareholder meetings.</div> <div>We believe that
there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests.
Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate
charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment including but not limited to changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the
distribution of income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of
directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership
to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote
at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded
adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our approach to engaging with
companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual
companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific
assessments.</div> <div>We believe BlackRock has a responsibility
in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the
best long-term economic interests of shareholders and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long-term shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have
appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a team profile on our website.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

<div>At a minimum, we expect companies to observe the accepted
corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the
best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the
company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long-term economic interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external
research.</div> <div>BlackRock views engagement as an important
activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of investee companies and their governance structures to better inform our voting decisions. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and approach to
investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a
range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock takes an engagement-first approach, emphasizing
direct dialogue with companies on governance issues that have a material impact on financial performance. We generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a
long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a
company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies,
or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek
to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

<div>There should be clear definitions of the role of the board,

approach is in the best interest of shareholders. We will</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the board is enhanced
when there is a clearly independent, senior non-executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the
independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to
shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe
that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a
significant adverse event.</div> <div>Auditors and audit-related
issues</div> <div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of
financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor.</div>
<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales and other special
transactions</div> <div>The capital structure of a company is
critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders
against the dilution of their interests.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership
and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting company value, and voting power should match
economic exposure.</div> <div>We are concerned that the creation of
a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share, one vote principle is designed to
mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such companies should review these dual-class structures on a regular
basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated
shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales or other special
transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction
to determine the degree to which it enhances long-term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that
executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would
expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be
subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take
into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions
consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a clear link between
variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees
can help ensure competitive pay; however we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of
results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long-term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div>
<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of
the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>It is within this context of our fiduciary duty to clients
that we undertake our investment stewardship activities. Sound practices in relation to the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors inherent in the business model can be a signal of operational excellence and management
quality.</div> <div>BlackRock expects companies to identify and
report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and
enhances the long-term economic value of the company. E&amp;S factors are material if they are core to how the business operates. The key performance indicators in relation to E&amp;S factors should also be disclosed and performance against them
discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the material E&amp;S factors relevant to the business. Any generally recognized best practices
and reporting standards adopted by the company should also be discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and
regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where local laws or regulations that significantly impact the company’s operations are contradictory or ambiguous to global norms.</div>
<div>Given that E&amp;S factors are often not issues on which a
shareholder votes, we will engage directly with the board or management. Engagement on a particular E&amp;S factor is based on our assessment that there are potential material economic ramifications for shareholders over the long-term.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with material E&amp;S factors appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or
realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will assess whether the company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern and whether there is a clear
and material economic disadvantage to the company if the issue is not addressed.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters and shareholder
protections</div> <div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the
right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP
ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high standard in our investment
stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who do not have other responsibilities other than their roles
in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees
(“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with
practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees,
the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global
Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of
BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global
Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews
periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by
the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and
executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions
to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial
matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s
affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an
exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues
which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s
ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share-blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in
proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are
not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as shareblocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with shareblocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 to engage, in certain instances, an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such

the independent fiduciary’s determination. BlackRock uses an independent fiduciary to vote proxies of (i) any company that is affiliated with BlackRock, Inc., (ii) any public company that includes BlackRock employees on its board of directors,
(iii) The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., (iv) any public company of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive, and (v) companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent fiduciary. In
selecting an independent fiduciary, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability to analyze proxy issues and vote in the best economic interest of our clients, reputation for reliability and integrity,
and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at an independent fiduciary. The

<div>General Description of the Trust and its Funds</div>
<div>The Trust currently consists of more than 270 investment
series or portfolios. The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on December 16, 1999 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end management investment company registered with the SEC under the 1940
Act. The offering of the Trust’s shares is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). This SAI relates to the following Funds:</div> <div>

BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an
“Underlying Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund offers and
issues shares at their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of
such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in the Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for
trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) or The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“NASDAQ”) (each, a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of
each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the
<font>Portfolio Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation
Units</font> section of this SAI) (other than the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF, which currently redeem Creation Units of its shares solely for cash).
Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 shares or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that
creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject
to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted
Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs
associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of
shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act restricts investments by
investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Funds beyond the limitations</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust,
the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Funds only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action
relief.</div> <div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares of each Fund are
listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Listing
Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month period
beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which a Fund is based is no
longer calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a
Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund or in the event a Fund does not comply with the continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s Prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional information regarding the
indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or through other widely disseminated means, an updated
indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor. The Trust is not involved in or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has an equity securities component and a cash
component. The equity securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit Securities required to be deposited in connection with the purchase of a
Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Fund at a particular point in time because the current portfolio of the Fund may include securities that are not a part of the
current Deposit Securities. Therefore, a Fund’s IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours should not be viewed as a real-time update of the Fund’s NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an IOPV consists of estimated
accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share prices of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each of the iShares MSCI Argentina and Global Exposure ETF,
iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, iShares MSCI Peru ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF and iShares MSCI UAE ETF seeks to achieve its
objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that comprise its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. </div>
<div>Each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India
Small-Cap ETF carries out its investment strategies by investing substantially all of its assets in a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Republic of Mauritius (each, a “Subsidiary” and collectively,</div> </div>

<div>the “Subsidiaries”). The remaining assets will be invested
directly by each Fund. BFA will serve as investment adviser to both the Funds and the Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, references made in this SAI to the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF refer to each Subsidiary
and/or each Fund, as applicable.</div> <div>Each Fund operates as
an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is
investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry
weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of
the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>
<div>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain
instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. Under normal market conditions, any borrowing by a Fund (except for the iShares MSCI
India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF) will not exceed 10% of the Fund’s net assets; however, each Fund (except for the iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF) generally does not
intend to borrow money. The iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a line of credit with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) that may be used for temporary or emergency
purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</font></div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a
Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders
will outweigh the current reduced return.</div> <div>Certain types
of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such
covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in
acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Currency Transactions.<font>  A
currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (“OTC”) obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract is agreed upon
by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon exchange rate and the
market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a specified future
time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures contracts will be maintained. The Funds do
not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of each Fund's assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S. currency forward and non-U.S. currency futures
transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</font></div>

<div>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of
risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and prices, can occur in such markets within very short
periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference by foreign governments through regulation of
local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange
transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. Each Fund could experience losses if the value of its currency
forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, including trading
commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</div>

“diversified” under the 1940 Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if,
with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to
the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum
distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment
objectives.</div> <div>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities
Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund may
enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from
the definition</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5
so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the <font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font>section of this SAI for more
information.</div> <div>Futures contracts provide for the future
sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock
of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon
entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is
returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument
or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract,
each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to
its delivery obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position
in the underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be
accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the
exercise price of the option on the futures contract. The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at
the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential
for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put.
Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter
into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily
basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out
Events”). Investments in futures contracts and other investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each
Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to its obligations relative to the position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each
Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s daily marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional
value (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of the underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were
required to set aside assets equal to the futures contracts’ full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies
in the future to comply with any changes in the guidance articulated from time to time by the SEC or its staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability
to invest in futures, options or other derivatives or make investments in such instruments more expensive.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments.<font>
 Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven
calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Funds’
liquidity risk management program (the “Liquidity Program”) as required by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act (the “Liquidity Rule”). Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund
may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial
actions be taken.</font></div> <div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>  Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at
least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's
total assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash
distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an
exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending,
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board
of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could
trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments for dividends received by a Fund for securities loaned out by the
Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt
securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities.<font>
 Each Fund intends to purchase publicly-traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American Depositary Receipts
(“ADRs”), Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) and European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”) (collectively, “depositary receipts”). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust
issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by an American bank or trust
company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as Continental depositary receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that
evidence ownership of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>either foreign or domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary
receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued in bearer form, are designed for use in
European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the world.</div>
<div>The Funds will not invest in any unlisted depositary receipt
or any depositary receipt that BFA deems illiquid at the time of purchase or for which pricing information is not readily available. In general, depositary receipts must be sponsored, but a Fund may invest in unsponsored depositary receipts under
certain limited circumstances.</div> <div>Depositary receipts are
generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to additional risks
associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency risk and liquidity risk.
Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the shareholder benefits that come from
investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</div> <div>Investing
in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of
expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital.
Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product
(“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”), or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity
pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term
“commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with
respect to the Funds.</div> <div>The iShares MSCI China Small-Cap
ETF, iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”) may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not
advised by BFA (the term “underlying fund” for purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate investment trusts, business
development companies, investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA has no transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they
are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim
of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA,
the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for such Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the
CEA in respect of such Funds.</div> <div>Derivative contracts,
including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable
regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in
through 2020. Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives
have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in such Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, a
Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives
contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net
basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on
physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A
repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to
repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by
the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s
obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase
agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally
strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that
utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be
eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default,
lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely
retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the
defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund’s exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a
value equal to or greater than the Fund’s obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in
additional securities.</font></div> <div>Securities of Investment
Companies.<font>  Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered
investment companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10%
of a Fund’s</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the
extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA,
in excess of the general limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to
those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which
reflect a Fund’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>  Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that
may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including
government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial
paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's<sup>®</sup> Investors Service, Inc., “F-1” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or
“A-1” by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., or if unrated, of comparable quality as
determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of
not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations
of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time
deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with
international transactions.</font></div> <div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party
agrees to make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or differential in rates of return) earned or realized on the underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund
receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an
aggregate value at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency
swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally
do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>
<div>Tracking Stocks.<font>  A
tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or operating division within a larger company and is designed to “track” the performance of such business unit or division. The tracking
stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the same rights
as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectuses, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an
investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding
that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of stocks in general, and other factors that affect the
market.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of
borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Cash Transactions Risk.
<font> Unlike most other exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF expects to effect all of its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. Paying
redemption proceeds in cash rather than through in-kind delivery of portfolio securities may require the Fund to dispose of or sell portfolio securities or other assets at an inopportune time to obtain the cash needed to meet redemption orders. This
may cause the Fund to sell a security and recognize a capital gain or loss that might not have been incurred if it had made a redemption in-kind. As a result, the Fund may pay out higher or lower annual capital gains distributions than ETFs that
redeem in-kind. The use of cash creations and redemptions may also cause the Fund’s shares to trade in the market at greater bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. As a practical matter, only institutions and
large investors, such as market makers or other large broker dealers, create or redeem shares directly through the Fund. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund on an exchange through a broker-dealer. Furthermore, the Fund may not be
able to execute cash transactions for creation and redemption purposes at the same price used to determine the Fund’s NAV. To the extent that the maximum additional charge for creation or redemption transactions is insufficient to cover the
execution shortfall, the Fund’s performance could be negatively impacted.</font></div>
<div>Commodities Investment Risk.
<font> Exposure to commodities markets may subject a Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The commodities markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility. Similar future
market conditions may result in rapid and substantial valuation increases or decreases in a Fund’s holdings.</font></div>
<div>The commodities markets may fluctuate widely based on a
variety of factors. Movements in commodity investment prices are outside of a Fund's control and may not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements may be influenced by, among other things: governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and
exchange control programs and policies; changing market and economic conditions; market liquidity; weather and climate conditions, including droughts and floods; livestock disease; changing supply and demand relationships and levels of domestic
production and imported commodities; changes in storage costs; the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems; energy conservation; the success of exploration projects; changes in international balances of payments and
trade; domestic and foreign rates of inflation; currency devaluations and revaluations; domestic and foreign political and economic events; domestic and foreign interest rates and/or investor expectations concerning interest rates; foreign
currency/exchange rates; domestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other political upheaval and conflicts; governmental expropriation; investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and
commodities funds; and changes in philosophies and emotions of market participants. The frequency and magnitude of such changes cannot be predicted.</div>
<div>The prices of commodities can also fluctuate widely due to
supply and demand disruptions in major producing or consuming regions. Certain commodities or natural resources may be produced in a limited number of countries and may be controlled by a small number of producers or groups of producers. As a
result, political, economic, regulatory and supply-related events in such countries could have a disproportionate impact on the prices of such commodities.</div>
<div>A decrease in the production of a physical commodity or a
decrease in the volume of such commodity available for transportation, mining, processing, storage or distribution may adversely impact the financial performance of a commodity or commodity-related company that devotes a portion of its business to
that commodity. Production declines and volume decreases could be caused by various factors, including catastrophic events affecting production, depletion of resources, labor difficulties, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment
failures and unexpected maintenance problems, import supply disruption, governmental expropriation, political upheaval or conflicts or increased competition from alternative energy sources or commodity prices. Agricultural commodities may be
adversely affected by weather or other natural phenomena, such as drought, floods and pests.</div>
<div>A sustained decline in demand for such commodities could also
adversely affect the financial performance of commodity-related companies. Factors that could lead to a decline in demand include economic recession or other adverse economic conditions, higher taxes on commodities or increased governmental
regulations, increases in fuel economy, consumer shifts to the use of alternative commodities or fuel sources, changes in commodity prices, or weather.</div>
<div>The commodity markets are subject to temporary distortions and
other disruptions due to, among other factors, lack of liquidity, the participation of speculators, and government regulation and other actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>foreign exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices
which may occur in a single business day (generally referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits”). The maximum or minimum price of a contract as a result of these limits is referred to as a “limit price.” If the limit
price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made beyond the limit price. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at disadvantageous times or
prices.</div> <div>Custody Risk.
<font> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and
volatile prices in less developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local
agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed
settlements or losses of security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging
markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility
of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain
countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and
may have no successful claim for compensation.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font>  There is
no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management Rule Risk.<font>  In October 2016, the SEC adopted the Liquidity Rule requiring open-end funds, including ETFs such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity.
Effective December 1, 2018, as required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented the initial portions of the Funds' Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Funds, has appointed BFA as the
liquidity risk program administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA, assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk. Certain aspects of the Liquidity Program were implemented effective
December 1, 2018, while the entire Program will take effect on June 1, 2019. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity
Rule.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology
failures, that could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the
setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and
mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to
completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.</font></div>
<div>Pre-Funding and Associated Risks. <font> Saudi Arabian equities can only be purchased on a pre-funded basis, whereby the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF or its broker (on behalf of the Fund), must deliver the applicable pre-funding amount to cover purchases
before trade executions may take place. In the event that the pre-funding amount is not delivered by the deadline established with the Fund’s custodian, or if the pre-funding amount is insufficient to purchase all the underlying securities in
connection with the creation or portfolio rebalance, the Fund would not be able to acquire all the requisite underlying securities during such purchase. In this situation, additional local currency would have to be delivered to the Fund’s
onshore custody account to enable additional purchases on subsequent days. This could result in higher brokerage costs for Authorized Participants in a creation and higher tracking error in the case of a portfolio rebalance.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Derivatives.<font>  A
derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the
S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options and other</font></div> </div>

<div>derivatives. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more
sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to
counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to prevent a Fund from being deemed to
have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a
Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate
gains and, in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and a Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying
security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Equity Securities.<font>
 An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of stock
markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to increases and decreases in
value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders generally
have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity
(the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither
a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</font></div>
<div>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are
listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in such securities.
There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for
the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are wide.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed only on the exchange on
which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time.
Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In
the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily
margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered
call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered stock index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures
position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to
the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they
invest.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund
involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a
broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome
margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the
daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little
or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. <font> An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and
political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in currencies
other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations include favorable
or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Investing in any of the Funds also involves certain risks
and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price
volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and
risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities
markets; more substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of
war.</font></div> <div>Risk of Swap Agreements.<font>  The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will
default on its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such
Fund’s rights as a creditor (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to
receive).</font></div> <div>A Fund is required to post and collect
variation margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Implementation of regulations requiring posting of initial margin is being phased in through 2020. These requirements may raise
the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.
<font> A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at
all. A Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences
for a Fund.</font></div> <div>Treaty/Tax Risk.<font>  Each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF operate, in part, through the Subsidiaries, which in turn invest in securities of Indian issuers. The Subsidiaries should be eligible to take
advantage of the benefits of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius (“DTAA”) in relation to investments in shares made until March 31, 2017. Numerous investors have relied on the benefits of the DTAA to invest in
India through Mauritius in the past.</font></div> <div>An investor
is required to submit the tax residency certificate (“TRC”) as issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and information as prescribed by the Government of India to claim benefits under the DTAA.</div> </div>

<div>Under the DTAA, India has the right to tax capital gains that
arise from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident. However, the DTAA provides for grandfathering of investments in shares made before April 1, 2017. Returns from investments in shares made on or after April 1,
2017 are subject to capital gains tax in India, although the DTAA provides for a limitation of benefits provision which shall be a prerequisite for a reduced rate of tax (50% of domestic tax rate) on capital gains arising during a two year
transition period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. The application of such provisions of the DTAA could result in the imposition of withholding and capital gains taxes and/or other taxes on the Subsidiaries by tax authorities in India. This
could significantly reduce the return to each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF on its investments in shares and the return received by each Fund’s shareholders.</div>
<div>Criteria for Residence of Companies in India.</div>
<div>A foreign company will be considered a resident in India if
its place of effective management (“POEM”) (defined as a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are in substance made) is in India in the relevant
financial year. This test is to be applied taking the relevant financial year as a whole into consideration. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (“CBDT”) has clarified that the provisions of POEM shall not apply to a company having
turnover of INR 500 million or less in a year.</div> <div>Indirect
Transfers.</div> <div>The Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT
Act”) imposes Indian tax and withholding obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (“indirect transfers”). It has been
clarified that Indian tax authorities will not reopen any assessment proceedings that were completed before April 1, 2012 and where no notice for reassessment has been issued prior to that date. It has also been clarified that any assessment or any
other order which stands validated due to the amendments in the Finance Act would be enforced. Given this clarification issued by the CBDT, the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF do not expect that their respective
shareholders or each Fund will become subject to tax or to withholding obligations with respect to completed assessments.</div>
<div>It has been clarified that the share or interest of the
foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the value of all the assets owned by the foreign entity.
The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, of such an asset without reduction of liabilities. The fair market value will be determined in accordance with the final Rule 11UB of the Income Tax Rules, 1962
(“IT Rules”). It has also been provided that where all the assets of the foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian assets shall be subject to capital gains tax in
India. The indirect transfer shall not be applicable in following cases:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>With respect to a foreign
entity that holds the Indian assets directly, if the transferor of share or interest in such a foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer neither holds the right of control
or management in the foreign entity, nor holds voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in such foreign entity. </td></tr>

respect to a foreign entity that holds the Indian assets indirectly, if the transferor of share or interest in such foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer does not hold

interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in the foreign entity, which results in holding the same share capital or voting power in the entity which directly holds the Indian assets. </td></tr></table>

in a foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes.</div>

foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives “substantial value” from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50% of the value of the
company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably attributable to the Indian assets.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Because the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India

shareholder redemptions of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF shares and sales of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF shares may have been subject to Indian tax and withholding obligations.

<div>Indian Economic Trading Partner Risk. <font> The Indian economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and social instability. Disparities of wealth, the pace of economic liberalization and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection may
lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest in India. In addition, India continues to experience religious and border disputes as well as separatist movements in certain Indian states. Unanticipated political or social developments may have an
adverse effect on India’s economy. The Indian government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the Indian economy, control the rate of inflation, reduce government
control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. There can be no assurance these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. The Indian government has experienced chronic structural public sector deficits. High amounts of debt and
public spending may stifle Indian economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. The Indian economy has grown rapidly during the past several years and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. India may experience
substantial (and, in some cases, extremely high) rates of inflation or economic recessions causing a negative effect on the Indian economy.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Africa.<font>
 Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or
military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries, genocidal
warfare.</font></div> <div>Certain countries in Africa generally
have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of countries in Africa are generally
underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market
capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended altogether.</div>
<div>Market volatility may also be heightened by the actions of a
small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need to effect securities transactions through these brokerage
firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (<font>i.e., </font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund effects
securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</div>
<div>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control
to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign
investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes
available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may
not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value of a Fund’s investments. Issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with
regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed
countries.</div> <div>In addition, governments of certain countries
in Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of
foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater
degree of risk associated with governmental approval in connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s
balance of payments declines, such African country may impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Funds of any restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local government approvals or take other
actions, each of which may involve additional costs to the Fund .</div>
<div>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new
and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by
new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in
Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such countries may not receive many of the protections available to
shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries. Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems
of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</div>
<div>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary
commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a
Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a
result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise
substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on
private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime,
including organized crime.</div> <div>Recent political instability
and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries in those countries and adversely impacted the
region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly through the region, and that
developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to investments in
the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Argentina. <font> Investments in Argentinian issuers and companies that have significant linkage to and/or economic exposure to Argentina involve risks that are specific to Argentina, including legal, regulatory, political and
economic risks. Argentina has experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, political instability and high unemployment rates. The Argentinian economy depends heavily on commodity exports, making it
vulnerable to commodity prices. Argentina’s key trading and foreign investment partners are Brazil, China and the U.S. Reduction in spending on Argentinian products and services, changes to the economies of its trading partners, trade
regulations or currency exchange rates may adversely affect the Argentinian economy.</font></div>
<div>Argentina has experienced a high level of debt and public
spending. Argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001 and nationalized private pensions in 2008. In 2014, minority bondholders of Argentina’s previously defaulted debt sought, and won, an</div> </div>

<div>injunction that prohibited Argentina from repaying bonds that had been
renegotiated, unless they simultaneously paid the holdout minority bondholders their full amount due as well. As a result, the Argentinian government, in 2014, subsequently entered a technical default on its debt. In 2016, after a series of court
appeals and negotiations, the government and minority bondholders entered into a settlement to resolve the dispute. Further defaults and related actions by Argentina may continue to impact the confidence of investors in Argentina, which could limit
the government’s ability to borrow in the future.</div>
<div>Argentina has experienced periods of significant political
instability and certain sectors and regions of Argentina experience high unemployment, which may cause downturns in the Argentinian market and adversely impact investments in a Fund. Heavy regulation of labor and product markets is pervasive in
Argentina and may stifle Argentinian economic growth or contribute to prolonged periods of recession. For example, in 2012, Argentina’s government made the decision to nationalize YPF S.A., the country’s largest energy company.</div>
<div>In addition, Argentina has previously imposed capital controls
that affected the inflow and repatriation of capital and the free transfer of securities. Such capital controls, if reinstituted, could disrupt the creation/redemption process, which could affect the trading of Fund shares, resulting in Fund shares
trading at a price that is materially different from NAV.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>
  Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation and/or
nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and
there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short
histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have
each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated
tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also
developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has
recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this
region.</div> <div>Certain governments in this region administer
prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their respective countries and may own or control
many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments
adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings
with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high
unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. Adverse economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the
risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia. <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been
prone to natural disasters, such as drought and flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of
Australia and New Zealand are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia, Europe and the U.S. The Australia–U.S. Free Trade Agreement has significantly expanded the trading relationship between the U.S. and
Australia. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australian economy. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new
regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has
exposure.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Brazil. <font> Investment in securities of companies domiciled in Brazil involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks
include, among others, a high level of price volatility in the Brazilian equity and currency markets, chronic structural public sector deficits, a rising unemployment rate and disparities of wealth.</font></div>
<div>Brazil has historically experienced high rates of inflation
and may continue to do so in the future. An increase in prices for commodities, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency (the real) and potential future governmental measures seeking to maintain the value of the real in relation to the U.S.
dollar, may trigger increases in inflation in Brazil and may slow the rate of growth of the Brazilian economy. Inflationary pressures also may limit the ability of certain Brazilian issuers to access foreign financial markets and may lead to further
government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that may adversely affect the overall performance of the Brazilian economy, which in turn could adversely affect a Fund's investments.</div>
<div>The Brazilian government has exercised, and continues to
exercise, significant influence over the Brazilian economy, which may have significant effects on Brazilian companies and on market conditions and prices of Brazilian securities. The Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and
occasionally drastic, intervention by the Brazilian government. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the core of Brazil’s economy. The Brazilian government’s
actions to control inflation and affect other economic policies have involved, among others, the setting of wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, fluctuation of the base interest rates, imposing exchange controls and limiting
imports into Brazil. In the past, the Brazilian government has maintained domestic price controls, and no assurances can be given that price controls will not be re-imposed in the future.</div>
<div>Investments in Brazilian securities may be subject to certain
restrictions on foreign investment. Brazilian law provides that whenever a serious imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments exists or is anticipated, the Brazilian government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign
investors of the proceeds of their investment in Brazil and on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. The likelihood of such restrictions may be affected by the extent of Brazil’s foreign currency reserves, the size of
Brazil’s debt service burden relative to the economy as a whole, and political constraints to which Brazil may be subject. There can be no assurance that the Brazilian government will not impose restrictions or restrictive exchange control
policies in the future, which could have the effect of preventing or restricting access to foreign currency.</div>
<div>The market for Brazilian securities is directly influenced by
the flow of international capital, and economic and market conditions of certain countries, especially other emerging market countries in Central and South America. Adverse economic conditions or developments in other emerging market countries have
at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the Brazilian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in Brazil. Crises in neighboring emerging market countries
also may increase investors’ risk aversion, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by Brazilian companies, including securities in which a Fund may invest.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America.<font>   The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and
political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of the region's exports and many economies in this region are particularly
sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of this region.</font></div>

<div>economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on
the securities in which a Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime,
including organized crime.</div> <div>Certain countries in Central
and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist
measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in
countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state
sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. A Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China.
<font> Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks
include, among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring
countries.</font></div> <div>Military conflicts, either in response
to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements with Hong Kong related to integration and religious and nationalist disputes with
Tibet and the Xinjiang region. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan that has included threats of invasion. Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between
China and Taiwan may adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense
concerns. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect performance of the Chinese economy.</div>
<div>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic
reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be
effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. The Chinese government
continues to maintain a major role in economic policy making and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on
repatriation of capital invested. In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China are not
subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider trading rules, tender offer regulation, stockholder proxy requirements and the requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information.
Stock markets in China are in the process of change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation.</div>
<div>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of
rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy and securities market. China’s economy is heavily
dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers, including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S., or a downturn in any of the
economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the securities of Chinese issuers.</div>
<div>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of
China (“PRC”) are subject to change, including the issuance of authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as
consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on a Fund and its investors, particularly in
relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In addition, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese companies may be less</div> </div>

<div>rigorous, and may result in significant differences between financial
statements prepared in accordance with the PRC accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets.<font>  Certain Funds may invest in H-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (“SEHK”)), A-shares
(securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies
incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the SZSE) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). Certain Funds may also invest in certain Hong Kong listed securities known as
Red-Chips (securities issued by companies incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial revenues from
or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial revenues from or
allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</font></div>
<div>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into two
classes: A-shares, which are mostly limited to domestic investors, and B-shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A-shares market is generally subject to greater government restrictions, including trading
suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B-shares market is generally smaller, less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A-shares market, which may lead to significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or
Red-Chips of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a “back-door listing” through Red-Chips
or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. “Back-door listing” is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing
and international capital. All of these share mechanisms are relatively untested and subject to political and economic policies in China. Market developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government intervention (including the
possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may make it difficult to acquire, dispose of or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect.<font> </font></div> <div>The iShares MSCI
China ETF and iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF may invest in A-shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (“Shanghai Connect”) or the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program (“Shenzhen Connect,” and together with
Shanghai Connect, “Stock Connect”). Stock Connect is a securities trading and clearing program with an aim to achieve mutual stock market access between the PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Limited, the SSE (in the case of Shanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case of Shenzhen Connect), and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (“CSDCC”). Under Stock Connect, a Fund’s trading of
eligible A-shares listed on the SSE or the SZSE, as applicable, would be effectuated through its Hong Kong brokers. Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect is subject to trading, clearance, settlement and other procedures, which could pose risks
to a Fund.</div> <div>Although no individual investment quotas or
licensing requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect, trading through Stock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the “Daily Quota”), which limits the maximum net purchases under Stock Connect each day. The Daily Quota does not
belong to a Fund and is utilized on a first-come-first-serve basis. As such, buy orders for A-shares would be rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded (although a Fund will be permitted to sell A-shares regardless of the Daily Quota balance). The
Daily Quota may restrict a Fund’s ability to invest in A-shares through Stock Connect on a timely basis, which could affect the Fund’s ability to effectively pursue its investment strategy. The Daily Quota is also subject to
change.</div> <div>A-shares purchased through Stock Connect
generally may only be sold or otherwise transferred through Stock Connect and in accordance with applicable rules. In order to comply with applicable local market rules and to facilitate orderly operations of a Fund, including the timely settlement
of Stock Connect trades placed by or on behalf of the Fund, BFA utilizes an operating model that will only be used by iShares ETFs with investments in A-shares through Stock Connect. Such operating model may reduce the risks of trade failures;
however, it will also allow Stock Connect trades to be settled without the prior verification by a Fund. Accordingly, this operating model may subject a Fund to additional risks, including an increased risk of inadvertently exceeding certain trade
or other restrictions or limits placed on the Fund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened risk of erroneous trades, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>While A-shares must be designated as eligible to be traded
under Stock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed on the SSE, the “SSE Securities,” and such eligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the “SZSE Securities”), those A-shares may also lose such designation, and if this occurs,
such A-shares may be sold but could no longer be purchased through Stock Connect. With respect to sell orders under Stock Connect, the SEHK carries out pre-trade checks to ensure an investor has sufficient A-shares in its account before the market
opens on the trading day. Accordingly, if there are insufficient A-shares in an investor’s account before the market opens on the trading day, the sell order will be rejected, which may adversely impact a Fund’s performance.</div>
<div>In addition, Stock Connect will only operate on days when both
the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are open for trading and when banking services are available in both markets on the corresponding settlement days. Therefore, an investment in A-shares through Stock Connect may subject a Fund to the risk of price
fluctuations on days when the Chinese markets are open, but Stock Connect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading under Stock Connect under certain circumstances. Where such a suspension of trading is
effected, a Fund’s ability to access A-shares through Stock Connect will be adversely affected. In addition, if one or both of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are closed on a U.S. trading day, a Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of
A-shares through Stock Connect in a timely manner, which could adversely affect the Fund’s performance.</div>
<div>A Fund’s investments in A-shares though Stock Connect
are held by its custodian in accounts in Central Clearing and Settlement System (“CCASS”) maintained by the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (“HKSCC”), which in turn holds the A-shares, as the nominee holder,
through an omnibus securities account in its name registered with the CSDCC. The precise nature and rights of a Fund as the beneficial owner of the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities through HKSCC as nominee is not well defined under PRC law. There
is a lack of a clear definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership and beneficial ownership under PRC law and there have been few cases involving a nominee account structure in the PRC courts. The exact nature and methods of enforcement of
the rights and interests of a Fund under PRC law is also uncertain. In the unlikely event that HKSCC becomes subject to winding up proceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities may not be regarded as held for
the beneficial ownership of a Fund or as part of the general assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors.</div>
<div>Notwithstanding the fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary
interests in the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in its omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar for SSE- or SZSE-listed companies will still treat HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions
in respect of such SSE Securities or SZSE Securities. HKSCC monitors the corporate actions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE Securities and keeps participants of CCASS informed of all such corporate actions that require CCASS participants to take
steps in order to participate in them. A Fund will therefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement and notification and implementation of corporate actions.</div>
<div>The HKSCC is responsible for the clearing, settlement and the
provisions of depositary, nominee and other related services of the trades executed by Hong Kong market participants and investors. Accordingly, investors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE Securities directly – they are held through their
brokers’ or custodians’ accounts with CCASS. The HKSCC and the CSDCC establish clearing links and each has become a participant of the other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-border trades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC
be declared as a defaulter, HKSCC’s liabilities in Stock Connect under its market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against the CSDCC. In that event, a Fund may
suffer delays in the recovery process or may not be able to fully recover its losses from the CSDCC.</div>
<div>Market participants are able to participate in Stock Connect
subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk management and other requirements as may be specified by the relevant exchange and/or clearing house. Further, the “connectivity” in Stock Connect requires the routing of
orders across the borders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This requires the development of new information technology systems on the part of the SEHK and exchange participants. There is no assurance that these systems will function properly or will
continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both markets. In the event that the relevant systems fail to function properly, trading in A-shares through Stock Connect could be disrupted, and a Fund’s ability to achieve its investment
objective may be adversely affected.</div> <div>The Shanghai
Connect program, launched in November 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in December 2016, are both in their initial stages and do not have an extensive operating history. Stock Connect is subject to regulations promulgated by
regulatory authorities and implementation rules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC and Hong Kong. The current regulations are untested and there is no certainty as to how they will be applied or interpreted going forward. In</div> </div>

<div>addition, the current regulations are subject to change and there can be no
assurance that Stock Connect will not be discontinued or abolished. New regulations may be issued from time to time by the regulators and stock exchanges in China and Hong Kong in connection with operations, legal enforcement and cross-border trades
under Stock Connect. A Fund may be adversely affected as a result of such changes. Furthermore, the securities regimes and legal systems of China and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on these differences. Further, different
fees, costs and taxes are imposed on foreign investors acquiring A-shares through Stock Connect, and these fees, costs and taxes may be higher than comparable fees, costs and taxes imposed on owners of other Chinese securities providing similar
investment exposure.</div> <div>A-Share Market Suspension
Risk.</div> <div>A-shares may only be bought from, or sold to, a
Fund at times when the relevant A-shares may be sold or purchased on the relevant Chinese stock exchange. The A-shares market can have a higher propensity for trading suspensions than many other global equity markets. Trading suspensions in certain
stocks could lead to greater market execution risk, valuation risks, liquidity risks and costs for a Fund, as well as for Authorized Participants that create and redeem Creation Units of the Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily limit, set
at 10%, of the amount of fluctuation permitted in the prices of A-shares during a single trading day. The daily limit refers to price movements only and does not restrict trading within the relevant limit. There can be no assurance that a liquid
market on an exchange will exist for any particular A-share or for any particular time. This could increase a Fund’s tracking error and/or cause a Fund to trade in the market at greater bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s NAV. Given that the A-share market is considered volatile and unstable (with the risk of widespread trading suspensions or government intervention), the creation and redemption of Creation Units may also be disrupted.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If
financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect
to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing
stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it
difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public
expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely
on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market
countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may
have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Eastern Europe. <font> Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe.
Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments have expropriated substantial amounts of private property,
and many claims of the property owners have never been fully settled.</font></div>
<div>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market
economies at different paces with different characteristics. Most Eastern European securities markets suffer from thin trading activity, dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate information. Information and transaction
costs, differential taxes, and sometimes political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor. In addition, these</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>markets are particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and
currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia also may attempt to assert its influence in the region through economic or even military measures, as
it did with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014. Eastern European economies may also be particularly susceptible to changes in the international credit markets due to their reliance on bank related inflows of capital. The
global economic crisis has restricted international credit supplies, and several Eastern European economies have faced significant credit and economic crises. Although some Eastern European economies are expanding again, major challenges are still
present as a result of their continued dependence on the Western European zone for credit.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. <font>  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity
and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation
by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local
governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments
imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor
the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market
valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.</font></div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even
the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in
the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example,
prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced
liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or
in order to meet redemption requests.</div> <div>Many emerging
market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be
weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market countries in the past
have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest,</div> </div>

<div>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in
emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including
confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign
securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Emerging markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.
<font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have
significant operations in, member states of the European Union (the “EU”). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the eurozone) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone
membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export
tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign
debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners, including some or all of the MSCI ACWI Index countries. Although certain European
countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have
experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Cyprus,
France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute “capital controls.” Countries may use these controls to restrict
volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and
sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These
downgrades may result in further deterioration of investor confidence. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including
countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social
unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets
and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and
far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may
introduce significant uncertainties and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the
EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. A Fund will face risks associated with the potential
uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could
contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU
is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets that a Fund invests in. The political, economic
and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent
years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the
U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly
strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by varying
political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant
investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity
of a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Frontier
Markets. <font> Investments in frontier market countries, such as Argentina, may be subject to greater risks than investments in more developed countries. Frontier market countries are subject to similar risks as
those of emerging market countries, but the risks are more pronounced in frontier market countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited
local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or
confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer’s ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested
capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on U.S. dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or
interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors;
(ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lax financial
reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.</font></div>

<div>Risk of Investing in India.
<font> India is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to more developed markets. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has
recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries, including Pakistan, and the Indian government has confronted separatist movements in several Indian states, including
Kashmir. Government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets offer higher potential for losses. Governmental actions could have a negative effect on the economic
conditions in India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of investments made by a Fund. The securities markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped and with some exceptions, consist of a small number of listed companies with
small market capitalization, greater price volatility and substantially less liquidity than companies in more developed markets. Stockbrokers and other intermediaries in India may not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S. or other, more
developed countries. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may also affect a Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price or time that it desires or the Fund’s ability to track its Underlying
Index.</font></div> <div>Global factors and foreign actions may
inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian companies, which may decrease the liquidity of a Fund’s portfolio
and result in extreme volatility in the prices of Indian securities. In November 2016, the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial</div> </div>

as a result, there is a risk of significant and unpredictable change in laws governing foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Foreign investors in particular may be adversely affected by new or amended
laws and regulations. Certain Indian regulatory approvals, including approvals from the SEBI, the central government and the tax authorities (to the extent that tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before a Fund can make investments in
Indian companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</div>
<div>Technology and software sectors represent a significant
portion of the total capitalization of the Indian securities markets. The value of these companies will generally fluctuate in response to technological and regulatory developments, and, as a result, a Fund’s holdings are expected to
experience correlated fluctuations.</div> <div>Natural disasters,
such as tsunamis, flooding or droughts, could occur in India or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Indian economy or operations of a Subsidiary, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. <font> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly reliant
on income from the sale of oil or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and foreign currency values. As global demand for oil fluctuates, many Middle Eastern
economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div> <div>In
addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies,
including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as
well as the value of securities in the Fund's portfolio.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of
development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of investors and financial
intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may
have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of
limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that
corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some
Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval
prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer
that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies
in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker
or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its
rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the
permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern
countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by
the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests
may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer
may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with
other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern
countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an
outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious
or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America. <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of
the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade arrangements among the
U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain
securities held by a Fund.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Peru.<font>  Investment in securities of Peruvian issuers involves risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in developed countries. Such heightened risks include, among others, less publicly
available financial and other information, political instability and social unrest. In addition, Peru faces economic development problems, including heavy regulation of labor which may stifle economic growth, significant unemployment in certain
regions and widespread underemployment.</font></div> <div>The
securities market of Peru is considered an emerging market characterized by a small number of listed companies and a secondary trading market with small trading volumes and limited participants. These factors and others limit the supply of
securities available for investment by a Fund. This may affect the rate at which a Fund is able to invest in Peru, the purchase and sale prices for such securities and the timing of purchases and sales.</div>
<div>The Peruvian economy is heavily dependent on commodities
markets. Peru is a major world producer of silver, zinc, copper, tin, lead and gold. Mineral exports generally account for the most significant portion of Peru's export revenue, and any changes in this sector could adversely impact the Peruvian
economy. In addition, the agriculture and fisheries sectors account for a large portion of Peruvian exports, and any changes in these sectors or fluctuations in the commodities markets could have an adverse impact on the Peruvian economy.</div>
<div>The Peruvian economy is dependent on the economies of other
Central and South American countries, Europe, China, and the U.S. as key trading partners. Reduction in spending on Peruvian products and services by any of these trading partners or a downturn in any of these economies could adversely affect the
Peruvian economy. Any change in the price or demand for Peruvian exports could adversely impact Peru’s economy. Peru’s economy may also be negatively affected if trade barriers, exchange controls or other protectionist measures are
imposed or negotiated by the countries with which it trades.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Investing in Qatar.
<font> Qatar is highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas and trade with other countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign
currency values and the market for oil and natural gas. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, Qatar may be significantly impacted. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a trade embargo against Qatar amid claims
that Qatar’s policies fuel extremism and terrorism. In response to these trade restrictions, Qatar established new trade routes with other countries, but continued strained relations with other countries in the Middle East may adversely affect
the Fund’s investments.  As a host to U.S. regional military operations, Qatar is susceptible to potential terrorist attacks. Qatar has periodically deployed troops to other Gulf Cooperation Council Countries to support their forces,
which could lead to hostilities against Qatar. Political, economic and social unrest could adversely affect the Qatari economy and could decrease the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the federal government
of Qatar exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has
an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Qatar is governed by a monarchic, emirate-type government. Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Qatar,
which could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Qatar’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor,
and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy. Allegations of human rights abuses against foreign laborers continue to surface and could affect relationships with key trading partners.</div>
<div>Although the political situation in Qatar is largely stable,
there remains the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of Qatar and strained relations with other countries in the Middle East may adversely affect the Fund’s investments. Political
instability in the larger Middle East region has caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Certain issuers located in Qatar may operate in, or have
dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its
reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an investor in such issuers will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. <font> The ability of foreign investors (such as the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF) to invest in Saudi Arabian issuers is new and untested. Such ability could be restricted or revoked by the Saudi Arabian government at
any time, and unforeseen risks could materialize due to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market Authority (“CMA”) places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors,
including a limitation on the Fund’s ownership of any single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent the Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against the Underlying
Index. These restrictions may be changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted at any time. The Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses or approvals
and may not be able to buy and sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could negatively impact the Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, compared to more developed
markets, given the limited history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore
vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi
Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persists, and the government has
an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other
countries in the Middle East due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as well as the value of
securities in the Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the</div> </div>

<div>value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi
riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have an adverse effect on the
economy.</div> <div>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not
be as developed as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price
fluctuations, uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than those of companies on exchanges in
more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of these securities and the Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future. Current regulations in Saudi Arabian markets may require the Fund to execute
trades of securities through a single broker. As a result, the Adviser will have less flexibility to choose among brokers on behalf of the Fund than is typically the case for investment managers.</div>
<div>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely
stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of
Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or other factors. Additionally, anti-Western
views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries may affect these attitudes and policies.
Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the Fund’s
portfolio.</div> <div>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may
operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may
sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an investor in such issuers will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United Arab Emirates
(“UAE”). <font> The UAE economy is dominated by petroleum export. The non-oil economy, concentrated in Dubai’s service sector, notably in tourism, real estate, banking and re-export trade, has grown
rapidly over the past several years. However, as the recent global credit crisis and the corresponding fallout in Dubai’s service sector have shown, the UAE economy remains anchored by Abu Dhabi’s oil production. A sustained decrease in
commodity prices could have a significant negative impact on all aspects of the UAE economy.</font></div>
<div>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the federal government
of the UAE and the governments of the individual emirates exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Although free zones have played a crucial part in the growth of the UAE’s non-oil economy, liberalization in the
wider economy has lagged: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the UAE is governed by an authoritarian government. Governmental
actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in the UAE, which could affect private sector companies and the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Although the political situation in the UAE is largely stable,
instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of the UAE. Recent political instability and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and
social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of the Fund.</div>
<div>Certain issuers located in the UAE may operate in, or have
dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its
reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an investor in such issuers will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. <font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, the country or countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries
may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy has recently experienced very difficult conditions and increased volatility, as well as significant adverse trends. While government intervention and recent legislation
has been</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>enacted to improve the U.S. economy, the recovery has been fragile and
modest. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions
and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. <font> Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls and increased competition. Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject
to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, and the success of exploration projects. Production of
industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims and may be
adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental policies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend heavily on
corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, worsening business cash flows,
tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates, corporate tax
rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples
sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on
commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices have
recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil
industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other
risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor
unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a
significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by federal, state and
local governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may
materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies. Market conditions and regulation in China may be particularly subject to change based on government policy.</font></div>
<div>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental
regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector,
including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in
many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be
predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses
are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government
regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the
financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and
financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types of companies in
the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and
increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an
adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take
actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or
increased government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent
on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in general.
The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an
over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and
mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. <font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction,
unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than
the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Finally, while all
companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could
have a material adverse effect on their businesses. These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. <font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and
government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials
may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry. <font> Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and
conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil
sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact companies in this industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in
addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In addition, the Middle East, where many companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly
competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant portion of their revenues may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. Companies that own or operate gas pipelines are
subject to certain risks, including pipeline and equipment leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous gases and other environmental risks.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), real estate holding and operating companies or real estate
development companies (collectively, “Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate
Companies are organized and operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies
involves various risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject
to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant
improvements,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income
and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company.
Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Distressed Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful
implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the securities of companies with higher credit and market
risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency
and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest
in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of
default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking. Investments
in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a
holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk.<font> Investing in
Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or
erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of
defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value
of the REIT and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient
capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both
directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on
real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some
countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and
potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory
approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be
arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new
technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications
sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations and
changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access
to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate conditions can also have a significant impact on
both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Saudi Arabia Broker Risk. <font> There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in the Saudi Arabian market. The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF generally expects to conduct its transactions in a manner in which the Fund would not
be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who can provide services to the Fund, which may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity and timing of Fund transactions. The limited
number of brokers may impact the Fund’s ability to achieve best execution on securities transactions. In addition, the limited number of brokers available to the Fund may make the Fund more susceptible to credit loss or trading disruptions in
the event of a default or business disruption by one or more of the available brokers. Should the Fund’s ability to use one or more brokers be affected for any reason, this could disrupt the operations of the Fund and affect the ability of the
Fund to track the Underlying Index and/or cause the Fund’s shares to trade at a premium or discount to NAV. The Fund may also incur losses due to the acts or omissions of its brokers in the execution or settlement of any transaction or in the
transfer of any funds or securities.</font></div> <div>Special Risk
Considerations Relating to the QFI Regime and Investments in Saudi Arabian Equities. <font> The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF’s ability to achieve its investment objective depends on the ability of BFA as a
foreign investor registered with the CMA as a Qualified Foreign Investor (“QFI”), and the Fund as a client of a QFI who has been approved by the CMA (a “QFI Client”), to maintain their respective authorizations from the CMA,
and thereby allow the Fund to invest in the constituent securities of the Underlying Index. A failure to maintain such authorization could limit the Fund’s ability to gain exposure to the securities of the Underlying Index and could increase
the cost to the Fund of gaining such exposure. Even with QFI Client status, the Fund will not have an exclusive investment quota and will be subject to foreign investment limitations and other regulations imposed by the CMA on QFIs and QFI Clients
(individually and in the aggregate), as well as local market participants. If such limitations are reached or other market factors impact the Fund’s ability to invest in securities of the Underlying Index or otherwise meet investor demand for
Fund shares, BFA may invest a portion of the Fund’s assets in securities not included in the Underlying Index or in derivatives, which may increase the Fund’s tracking error. If the Fund is unable to invest in a manner consistent with
its investment objective and tracking risk tolerance, BFA may reject new creation orders for Fund shares. Rejection of new creation orders could cause the Fund’s shares to trade in the secondary market at a higher than usual premium or
discount to NAV. QFI regulations and local market infrastructure are relatively new and have not been tested through multiple business cycles or market events, and the CMA may discontinue the QFI regime and other avenues for foreign investment in
Saudi Arabian equities at any time, or impose additional barriers or restrictions on foreign investment. Any change in the QFI system generally, including the possibility of BFA or the Fund losing their respective QFI and QFI Client status, may
affect the Fund’s ability to invest in securities of the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For all Funds other than the iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF
(the “Sustainable Fund”) and iShares MSCI Peru ETF, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting
Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Funds. For the Sustainable Fund, the Board has
delegated the voting of proxies for the Sustainable Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Sustainable Fund’s Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares Sustainable ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted the
BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies and supplemental guidelines applicable to environmental and social issues investing (the “Supplemental BlackRock Sustainable Proxy Voting Guidelines”) governing proxy voting by the iShares sustainable ETFs
managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Sustainable Fund.</div>

<div>hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the
other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s
affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains
procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA
may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div>
<div>Under the Supplemental BlackRock Sustainable Proxy Voting
Guidelines, the Sustainable Fund maintains proxy voting guidelines consistent with the belief that well-managed companies will deal effectively with the material environmental and social (E&amp; S) factors relevant to their businesses. BFA expects
companies to identify and report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. BFA may vote against the election of directors where BFA has concerns that a company might not be dealing with
E&amp;S issues appropriately. For E&amp;S shareholder proposals, BFA may vote differently for different funds based on BFA’s assessment of the materiality of the underlying issues in conjunction with an assessment that investors in the
Sustainable Fund may expect more urgent action be taken by the company.</div>
<div>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy, the iShares
Sustainable ETFs Proxy Voting Policy, the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies and the Supplemental BlackRock Sustainable Proxy Voting Guidelines are attached as Appendices A1, A2, A3 and A4, respectively.</div>
<div>The iShares MSCI Peru ETF:</div>
<div>The Trust has approved separate proxy
voting guidelines for the iShares MSCI Peru ETF and has delegated to Sustainalytics responsibility for voting proxies on the portfolio securities held by the Fund. The remainder of this section discusses the Fund’s proxy voting guidelines and
Sustainalytics’ role in implementing such guidelines.</div>
<div>Sustainalytics offers independent voting
services on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) matters. Sustainalytics’ usual approach to voting policies is to observe the International Corporate Governance Network’s Statement of Corporate Governance Principles
supplemented by the specific code of the relevant market. For Peru, the specific market code is the Principles of Good Governance for Peruvian Companies (the “Code”) published in 2002. It is not a policy that can be directly used in
voting, as it does not set specific guidelines for implementing the principles it espouses, and it takes a “comply or explain” approach. Companies are required to file with the Lima Stock Exchange (BVL) a self-assessment of their
compliance with each of the key principles in the Code and most include this in their annual report. Various reports from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and similar non-governmental organizations
(“NGOs”) on the observance of the Code suggest that companies find it difficult to accurately assess their compliance and that there is considerable room for improvement in implementation, both on the part of companies and the
authorities responsible for the governance framework.</div>
<div>Sustainalytics’ assessment of the
governance of companies, and the merits of specific proposals, will be dependent on the information available in the public domain. Sustainalytics will always endeavor to refer to company websites, proxy research provided by third parties and annual
reports from previous years in an effort to build a better understanding of a company. Nonetheless, there will be instances where reporting for the current year is neither adequate nor timely and other sources not that informative. Sustainalytics
will then make a “best efforts” recommendation in these situations.</div>
<div>Sustainalytics believes that the most
important routine are related to the appointment of directors and the auditors, and by implication the independence of these parties. In large part, this is because Peru has a relatively small and close-knit corporate community and the ownership
structure means that majority shareholders usually have board representation. They are also important because related party transactions struck without the oversight of independent directors (and based on the financial assessments of independent
auditors) have the potential to work to the disadvantage of minority shareholders.</div>
<div>The Fund votes (or refrains from voting)
proxies in a manner that is consistent with these principles. In some cases, it may be in the best interest of shareholders of the Fund to refrain from exercising the Fund’s proxy voting rights. Sustainalytics, as proxy voting agent for the
Fund, will vote (or refrain from voting) on specific proxy issues in accordance with its proxy voting guidelines. The Fund votes (or refrains from voting) proxies without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the</div> </div>

<div>proxy (or any shareholder of such issuer) to the Fund, the
Fund’s affiliates (if any), BFA or BFA’s affiliates, or the Distributor or the Distributor’s affiliates.</div>
<div>With respect to certain specific
issues:<br/> </div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>In the Code, independent
directors are defined as “those selected for their professional prestige and who are not connected to the company management, nor to the control group of the same”. The Code also states that a “sufficient number of directors should
be elected, capable of exercising independent judgment”. Although the number of directors considered “sufficient” is not specified, Sustainalytics would normally expect it to be one-third to one-half of the board. That said,
assessing true independence is difficult because: (i) the biographies of directors given in the annual reports of most Peruvian companies are sparse on details (although any conflicts of interest are meant to be declared according to the Code); and
(ii) companies do not disclose, prior to the meeting, details of the proposed director(s) to be appointed. Such information is only disclosed during the shareholders’ meeting. In voting, the Fund’s votes would normally be cast for the
(re-) election of directors unless Sustainalytics had strong concerns that a lack of independent directors had resulted in decisions or outcomes that were detrimental to minority shareholders. In making that assessment, Sustainalytics will review
the composition and charters of board sub-committees where this information is available. Some issuers follow a local market practice that effectively renders it impossible to actively oppose director candidates. In those circumstances, when
Sustainalytics determines to oppose a director, the only manner in which to register opposition will be to (i) refrain from registering any vote at the meeting or (ii) present an alternate candidate. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Auditor independence can be
assessed by using as a proxy the level of fees earned from non-audit work done by the auditors for the company. The Code recommends that this information is disclosed. Sustainalytics would normally expect that non-audit fees did not exceed audit
fees. Unless there were extenuating circumstances (e.g. a major corporate transaction that required corporate finance advice), Sustainalytics would vote against any auditor-related resolution on the agenda if the non-audit fees exceeded audit fees
during the prior fiscal year. Sustainalytics would also vote against the appointment of the auditor when its identity has not been disclosed by the company. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The Code recommends that
resolutions on the agenda of the general meeting of shareholders do not include generic matters. Sustainalytics would normally withhold votes or vote against such resolutions as ‘Any other business’, depending on their overall assessment
of the board and its past actions. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Amendments to a
company’s articles of association are meant to be put to shareholders for approval. Sustainalytics would normally expect to vote in support of such a resolution, but would withhold votes or vote against where the proposed changes weakened
minority shareholder rights or were otherwise detrimental to the interests of minority shareholders. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The other
significant area of business on which shareholders ought to be able to vote is significant acquisitions or divestments. Sustainalytics would assess these on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the merits of the proposed transaction and whether
it would seem to benefit all shareholders. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Sustainalytics seeks to apply the
Fund’s proxy voting policies consistently across all proposals and issues votes strictly according to the Fund’s policy in order to minimize conflicts of interests. Sustainalytics also maintains policies and practices that are designed
to neutralize and guard against any conflict of interest that could arise between the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder of the issuer) and Sustainalytics or Sustainalytics' affiliates. In certain instances, Sustainalytics may engage a
qualified third party to perform a proxy analysis and issue a vote recommendation as a further safeguard to avoid the influence of a potential conflict of interest.</div>
<div>BlackRock’ s Investment Stewardship
Team is responsible for confirming that Sustainalytics has adopted and implemented written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the Peru Fund's proxies are voted by Sustainalytics in the best interests of the Fund and
that Sustainalytics has established and implemented measures reasonably designed to identify and address any conflicts that can arise on an ongoing basis by requiring Sustainalytics to provide updates regarding any changes to their business,
including with respect to capacity and competency to provide proxy voting advice, or their conflict policies and procedures. In addition, the adequacy of such policies and procedures shall be reviewed at least annually, and proxy voting for the Fund
shall be monitored to ensure compliance with Sustainalytics' proxy voting guidelines, such as by sampling votes cast for the Fund, including routine proposals as well as those that require more analysis, to confirm compliance.</div>

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy regarding the disclosure of the
Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests of each Fund’s respective shareholders; (ii) does not put
the interests of BFA, the Distributor or any affiliated person of BFA or the Distributor, above those of Fund shareholders; (iii) does not advantage any current or prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund
shareholders, except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not available to other current or prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary
for transactions in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided to personnel of BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of the Fund for the purpose of
facilitating risk management and hedging activities; and (iv) does not provide selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting
the use of such information are in effect. The “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based
subscription services, large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and market makers and
other institutional market participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's portfolio holdings information
is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to those other fee-based subscription services, including market
makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading shares of the Funds in the secondary market or evaluating such
potential transactions. This information typically reflects each Fund’s anticipated holdings on the following business day.</div>
<div>Daily access to information concerning the Funds' portfolio
holdings is permitted: (i) to certain personnel of those service providers that are involved in portfolio management and providing administrative, operational, risk management, or other support to portfolio management; and (ii) to other personnel of
BFA, the Distributor and their affiliates, and the administrator, custodian and fund accountant who deal directly with, or assist in, functions related to investment management, distribution, administration, custody, securities lending and fund
accounting, as may be necessary to conduct business in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. In addition, each Fund discloses its fixed-income and/or equity portfolio holdings daily at <font>www.iShares.com</font>. More information about this disclosure is available at <font>www.iShares.com</font>.</div>
<div>Portfolio holdings information made available in connection
with the creation/redemption process may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds in the ordinary course of business after it has been disseminated to the NSCC. From time to time, information concerning portfolio holdings
other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds, including rating or ranking organizations, in the
ordinary course of business, no earlier than one business day following the date of the information.</div>
<div>Each Fund discloses its complete portfolio holdings schedule
in public filings with the SEC within 70 days of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters and within 60 days of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters and will provide such information to shareholders as required by federal
securities laws and regulations thereunder. A Fund may, however, voluntarily disclose all or part of its portfolio holdings other than in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, in advance of required filings with the
SEC, provided that such information is made generally available to all shareholders and other interested parties in a manner that is consistent with the above policy for disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Such information may be made
available through a publicly available website or other means that make the information available to all likely interested parties contemporaneously.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes</div>
<div>Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes are provided
below.</div> <div>With respect to certain underlying indexes of the
iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed investment concepts and strategies that could be
considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted the index using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its sole
discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the underlying
index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or pursuant to
other communications with the index provider.</div> <div>The MSCI
Indexes</div> <div>The MSCI indexes were founded in 1969 by Capital
International S.A. as international performance benchmarks constructed to facilitate comparison of world markets. The MSCI single country standard equity indexes have covered the world's developed markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI commenced
coverage of emerging markets.</div> <div>Local stock exchanges
traditionally calculated their own indexes, which were generally not comparable with one another due to differences in the representation of the local market, mathematical formulas, base dates and methods of adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,
however, applies the same calculation methodology to all markets for all single country standard equity indexes, both developed and emerging.</div>
<div>MSCI's Global Investable Market Indexes (the “MSCI
GIMI”) provide coverage and non-overlapping market segmentation by market capitalization size and by style. The MSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99% coverage of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each market of large-,
mid- and small-cap securities.</div> <div>

 Global Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of companies with a market capitalization below that of the companies in the MSCI Global Standard Indexes. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes</div>
<div>Selection Criteria.<font> MSCI's
index construction process involves: (i) defining the equity universe; (ii) determining the market investable equity universe for each market; (iii) determining market capitalization size segments for each market; (iv) applying final size segment
investability requirements; and (v) applying index continuity rules for the MSCI Global Standard Index.</font></div>
<div>Defining the Equity Universe<font>.
MSCI begins with securities listed in countries in the MSCI GIMI. As of October 31, 2018, 23 are classified as developed markets, 24 as emerging markets, and 29 as frontier markets. All listed equity securities and listed securities that exhibit
characteristics of equity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited partnerships and most investment trusts, are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. REITs in some countries and certain income trusts in Canada are
also eligible for inclusion. Each company and its securities (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., share classes) are classified in only one country.</font></div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Determining the Market Investable Equity Universe for Each
Market.<font> The equity universe in any market is derived by applying investability screens to individual companies and securities in the equity universe of that market. Some investability requirements are applied at the
individual security level and some at the overall company level, represented by the aggregation of individual securities of the company. As a result, the inclusion or exclusion of one security does not imply the automatic inclusion or exclusion of
other securities of the same company.</font></div> <div>Determining
Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market.<font> In each market, MSCI creates an Investable Market Index, Standard Index, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index. The MSCI Global Standard Index is the
aggregation of the Large Cap Index and Mid Cap Index. The MSCI GIMI are the aggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index and MSCI Global Small Cap Index. In order to create size components that can be meaningfully aggregated into composites,
individual market size segments balance the following two objectives:</font></div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Achieving
global size integrity by ensuring that companies of comparable and relevant sizes are included in a given size segment across all markets in a composite index; and </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Achieving
 consistent market coverage by ensuring that each market's size segment is represented in its proportional weight in the composite universe. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Applying Final Size Segment Investability Requirements. <font>In order to enhance replicability of the indexes, additional size segment investability requirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and MSCI Global Standard Index. These investability requirements include minimum free
float-adjusted market capitalization, minimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and minimum length of trading.</font></div>
<div>Applying Index Continuity Rules for the Standard Index.<font> In order to achieve index continuity as well as provide some basic level of diversification within a market index, notwithstanding the effect of other index construction rules contained herein, a minimum number of five
constituents will be maintained for a developed market Standard Index and a minimum number of three constituents will be maintained for an emerging market Standard Index.</font></div>
<div>Weighting.<font> All indexes of the
MSCI GIMI are free float weighted, </font><font>i.e.,</font><font> companies are included in the indexes at the value of their free public float (free float multiplied by
security price).</font></div> <div>Regional Weights.<font> Market capitalization-weighting, combined with a consistent target of approximately 99% of free float-adjusted market capitalization, helps ensure that each country's weight in regional and international indexes
approximates its weight in the total universe of developing and emerging markets. A market is equivalent to a single country except for developed Europe, where all markets are aggregated into a single market for index construction purposes.
Individual country indexes of the European developed markets are derived from the constituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.</font></div>
<div>Free Float.<font> MSCI defines the
free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. In practice, limitations on free float available to international investors
include: (i) strategic and other shareholdings not considered part of available free float; and (ii) limits on share ownership for foreigners.</font></div>
<div>Under MSCI's free float-adjustment methodology, a
constituent's inclusion factor is equal to its estimated free float rounded-up to the closest 5% for constituents with free float equal to or exceeding 15%. For example, a constituent security with a free float of 23.2% will be included in the index
at 25% of its market capitalization. For securities with a free float of less than 15%, the estimated free float is adjusted to the nearest 1%.</div>
<div>Price and Exchange Rates</div>
<div>Prices.<font> The prices used to
calculate all MSCI indexes are the official exchange closing prices or those figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day.</font></div>
<div>Exchange Rates.<font> MSCI uses the
World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year's Day), the previous business day's rates are
normally used. MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters rates are not available, or if MSCI determines
that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances for a given currency on a particular day. In such circumstances, an announcement would be sent to clients with the related</font></div> </div>

investment community to gather feedback on the most relevant exchange rate.</div>
<div>Changes to the Indexes.<font> The
MSCI GIMI are maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of the underlying equity markets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes, emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and minimizing turnover in the
indexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves many aspects, including: (i) additions to, and deletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in number of shares; and (iii) changes in inclusion factors as a result of updated free float
estimates.</font></div> <div>Index maintenance can be described by
three broad categories of changes:</div> <div>
<table>

 Index Reviews (“SAIRs”), conducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable that systematically reassess the various dimensions of the equity universe for all markets; </td></tr>

<tr>

 </td>
<td>Ongoing
 event-related changes, such as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies, reorganizations and other similar corporate events, which generally are implemented in the indexes as they occur. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Potential changes in the status of countries (stand-alone,
frontier, emerging and developed) follow their own implementation time tables.</div>
<div>MSCI conducts SAIRs generally as of the close of the last
business day of May and November. During the SAIRs, MSCI updates the investable equity universe and reassesses size segmentation investability requirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs generally as of the close of the last business day of February and
August. During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index that were not captured at the time of their actual occurrence, but are significant enough to be included before the next SAIR. The results of the SAIR and QIR are generally announced at
least ten business days in advance of implementation.</div> <div>MSCI
25/50 Indexes<br/> </div> <div>Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes (the
“25/50 Indexes”) is a sub-index of either an MSCI Global Standard Index or an MSCI GIMI. Their construction reflects the diversification requirements applicable to RICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The 25/50
Indexes are free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted indexes with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of index weight, and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not
cumulatively exceed 50% of the index weight. A software application called the Barra Optimizer is utilized to calculate the capped index weights through an optimization function which is aimed at minimizing index turnover, tracking error and extreme
deviation from the uncapped index.</div> <div>MSCI ACWI Sustainable
Impact Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
101</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The MSCI ACWI Sustainable Impact Index is composed exclusively of companies whose core business addresses at least one of the world’s major social and environmental challenges, as defined by the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”). Examples of sustainable impact categories within the UN SDGs include nutritious food, treatment of major diseases, sanitary products, education, affordable housing, energy efficiency, green
building, sustainable water, and pollution prevention. To be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, companies must generate at least 50% of their annual sales from one or more of the sustainable impact categories and maintain minimum
environmental, social and governance standards. The latest reported sustainable impact sales percentage data would be used for all quarterly index reviews.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology. <font>The
Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating the net dividends. The
regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes withheld at the rate
applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents.</font></div>

greater than 10% to Argentina, as defined by MSCI, where the criteria outlined in (i) and (ii) do not result in a target number of securities and issuers. The Underlying Index targets a minimum of 25 securities and 20 issuers at construction. The
index is designed to take into account the 25% and 50% concentration constraints required for a fund to qualify as a RIC in the U.S. At each quarterly rebalance, no single index constituent may exceed 25% of the index weight, and the sum of all
constituents with index weights greater than 5% may not exceed 50%.</font></div>
<div>MSCI All Peru Capped Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 25</font></div> <div>Weighting.<font> The MSCI All Peru Capped Index is an index in which, at each quarterly index review, the weight of any single group entity is capped at 22.5% and all group entities with a weight greater than 4.5% will have their

<div>Selection Criteria.<font> The
Underlying Index is an MSCI index designed to measure the performance of the “Broad Peru Equity Universe.” MSCI identifies the “Broad Peru Equity Universe” as securities of companies (i) that are classified in Peru according
to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index Methodology (a methodology employed by MSCI to construct its GIMI, which classifies eligible securities according to their country of listing), together with (ii) companies that are not classified in Peru
according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index Methodology but are either headquartered or listed in Peru and have significant linkage to Peru, as defined by MSCI, or (iii) that have economic exposure greater than 10% to Peru, as defined by
MSCI, where the criteria outlined in (i) and (ii) do not result in the target number of securities and issuers. MSCI's index construction process involves: (i) defining the equity universe and (ii) determining security selection.</font></div>
<div>(i) <font>Defining the Equity
Universe.</font> MSCI begins by identifying Peruvian equity securities. Peruvian equity securities are defined as securities of companies (i) that are classified in Peru according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index Methodology, together with
(ii) companies that are not classified in Peru according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index Methodology but are either headquartered or listed in Peru and have significant linkage to Peru, as defined by MSCI, or (iii) that have economic
exposure greater than 10% to Peru, as defined by MSCI, where the criteria outlined in (i) and (ii) do not result in the target number of securities and issuers. All listed Peruvian equity securities, or listed Peruvian securities that exhibit
characteristics of equity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited partnerships, and most investment trusts are eligible for inclusion in the Broad Peru Equity Universe.</div>
<div>(ii) <font>Determining security
selection.</font> The securities of the Broad Peru Equity Universe are ranked by their decreasing free float-adjusted market capitalization. Some investability requirements are applied at the individual security level and some at the overall company
level, represented by the aggregation of individual securities of the company. Only one security per issuer is considered. The top 25 securities are selected for inclusion in the initial Underlying Index according to the following rules:</div>
<div>1. If a company eligible for inclusion within the Underlying
Index has more than one equity security outstanding, the security with the most liquidity, as defined by MSCI, will be included in the Underlying Index. If a company has two types of shares or more in the local market, the eligible security for
inclusion is the one that has the most liquidity, as defined by MSCI to be measured by the Annualized Traded Value Ratio (ATVR).</div>
<div>2. If a company eligible for inclusion within the Underlying
Index has a secondary listing in a foreign market or dual listing in addition to its local listing, the security with the most liquidity, as defined by MSCI, will be included in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>3. If a company eligible for inclusion within the Underlying
Index has an ADR or a GDR listing in a foreign market in addition to its local listing, the security with the most liquidity, as defined by MSCI, will be included in the Underlying Index.</div>

<div>MSCI Saudi Arabia IMI 25/50 Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 72</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The MSCI Saudi Arabia IMI 25/50 Index is designed to measure the performance of the large-, mid- and small-cap segments of the Saudi Arabia market. The Underlying Index incorporates foreign ownership limit restrictions.
It also applies certain investment limits that are imposed on RICs under the current Internal Revenue Code. The Underlying Index covers approximately 99% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in Saudi Arabia.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology. <font>The
25/50 Indexes take into account the investment limits required of RICs under the current Internal Revenue Code. One requirement of a RIC is that at the end of each quarter of its tax year no more than 25% of the value of the RIC's assets may be
invested in a single issuer and the sum of the weights of all issuers representing more than 5% of the fund should not exceed 50% of the fund’s total assets.</font></div>
<div>The 25/50 Index methodology aims to minimize index turnover,
tracking error and extreme deviation from the parent index. The indexes are rebalanced quarterly. Changes resulting from each rebalancing are made as of the close of the last business day of February, May, August and November, coinciding with the
quarterly index reviews of their parent indexes.</div>

<div>Notations Regarding each of the iShares MSCI Argentina and
Global Exposure ETF, iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF and iShares MSCI UAE ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
<div>The following notations are not considered to be part of each
Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their
activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any one
or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to each Fund as to how to
classify issuers within or among industries.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing
money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks
or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset
coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of a Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of
all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus
are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when each Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark
liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be
interpreted to permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate or earmark liquid
assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be
borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the Investment
Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the
Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities
may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause each Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will
be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged
in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets
(including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative
instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>

be invested in illiquid securities (calculated at the time of investment).</div>

</div> <div>If any percentage restriction described above is
complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that certain percentage limitations will be observed
continuously in accordance with applicable law.</div> <div>All
Funds</div> <div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment
policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the component securities of its Underlying
Index or in depositary receipts representing component securities in its Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent
to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund (except for the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares
MSCI India Small-Cap ETF) has adopted a non-fundamental policy such that, under normal market conditions, any borrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's net assets.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase
securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance
on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of
Section 12(d)(1).</div> <div>Unless otherwise indicated, all
limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of a Fund's assets invested in certain securities or other instruments resulting
from market fluctuations or other changes in a Fund’s total assets will not require a Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax
consequences.</div> <div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><font>Board –
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business
and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing
Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing
Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure.
The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and
the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses
key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review
risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal
counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment
performance or other activities.</div> <div>Committees of the Board

<div>subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this section as the
“Entities”), and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described
below.</div> <div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset
management firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, including,
in the case of BlackRock, the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities,
cash and alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest
that could disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other
instruments that may be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities have proprietary interests in, and
may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types
of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock and Entities are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary
basis. As such, BlackRock and Entities are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities,
currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's
transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Fund.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of
the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies
of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research
or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund,
market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged.
BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it
might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> <div>Conflicts
may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short
by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its
other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could
result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and redemptions, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such</div> </div>

<div>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade,
BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities and their respective clients may
pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of the Fund's investments may be negatively impacted
by the activities of BlackRock or the Entities or their respective clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or
advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or
more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Entities or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or an Entity for clients
worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and the Entities designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain
securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Entities are performing services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock or one or more Entities for their
proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual
issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div> <div>In connection
with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in
accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed by
them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities
or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or an Entity, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or an Entity, serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases,
such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the
purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or an Entity.</div>
<div>BlackRock or one or more Entities may also create, write or
issue derivatives for their clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the
index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock will receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging
to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on
the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability of such derivative products
by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect
to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock or one or more Entities and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock or an Entity where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the
Fund.</div> <div>At times, these activities may cause business
units or entities within BlackRock or an Entity to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock and/or Entities
on an arm’s-length basis.</div> <div>To the extent authorized
by applicable law, BlackRock or one or more Entities may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees,
underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock or an Entity will be in its view commercially reasonable, although
BlackRock and each Entity, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock or the Entity and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based
funds also may use an index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of the Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock and the Entities (and
their personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to
the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock or an Entity of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock or an Entity acts as broker, dealer, agent,
adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock or the Entity may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships
with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's
counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate pro-rata allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity</div> </div> <div type="Block">

indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when
aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal
opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by
the firm.</div> <div>Purchases and sales of securities and other
assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock,
however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client
direction.</div> <div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may
make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect
of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated
order.</div> <div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select
brokers (including, without limitation, certain Entities) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in
BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by
law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or
other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the
research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client
accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate
benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for
those products and services itself.</div> <div>BlackRock does not
currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular
broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to
pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such
arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in
the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where
permitted, an Entity, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many
of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks
(“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or an Entity has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions for certain types of
securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and
markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain
circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or
an Entity, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting
Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div> <div>It is also possible
that, from time to time, BlackRock or an Entity may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute
to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the Entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any
time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or an Entity could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the
Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other shareholders in deciding
whether to redeem its shares but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or
engage in transactions with, companies with which an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests or in which an Entity makes a market. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such
issuances. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies to which an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. Such investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of
a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other clients of BlackRock or an Entity. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of
these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock or an Entity may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. When an Entity is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution of securities of an
entity, BlackRock may be prohibited from purchasing or recommending the purchase of certain securities of that entity for a Fund. As indicated below, BlackRock or an Entity may engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds
or other clients of BlackRock or of an Entity have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), a public
company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has
representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co
participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co
transaction.</div> <div>BlackRock and the Entities, their personnel
and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and the Entities and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other
products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and the Entities and their sales personnel may directly or indirectly

<div>shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit
from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock or the Entities and such personnel resulting from transactions on
behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a
Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a
potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients
with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such
valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants,
there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are
valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability
to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party
valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
by BlackRock (pursuant to Board-adopted procedures) at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for
which it receives an asset-based fee.</div> <div>To the extent
permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to the extent
permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy
and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be
taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and
BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information
regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by
e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div> <div>BlackRock will not
purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated with a Fund
as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be
appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted
because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise
relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit
their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock or an Entity is performing investment banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when
BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in
BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as
directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate
information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Entity, or are the subject of an advisory or risk management
assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of BlackRock for their proprietary
accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in
certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their
proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer
disadvantages or business restrictions.</div> <div>If certain
aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or
exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict,
forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the
creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div> <div>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use
the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using
BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to any Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a
license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the
potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for the Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally
keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a
reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with
third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall
relationship with such service providers. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions may accrue, in whole or in part, to
BlackRock.</div> <div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest
in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision of services to accounts managed by
BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service
provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) to be one of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders
for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development partner, BlackRock has licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. Once the ICE Platform is launched, BlackRock intends to use the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and
redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues
earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s intellectual property to ICE and for BlackRock’s role as development partner. ICE Data Services, the underlying index provider for certain of the Funds, is a wholly owned subsidiary
of ICE.</div> <div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service
provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>A Fund from time to time may purchase in the secondary market
(i) certain mortgage pass-through securities packaged and master serviced by PNC Mortgage Securities Corp. (“PNC Mortgage”) or Midland Loan Services, Inc. (“Midland”), or (ii) mortgage-related securities containing loans or
mortgages originated by PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) or its affiliates. It is possible that under some circumstances, PNC Mortgage, Midland or other affiliates could have interests that are in conflict with the holders of
these mortgage-backed securities, and such holders could have rights against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates. For example, if PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates engaged in negligence or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties
as a master servicer, then any holder of the mortgage-backed security could seek recourse against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable. Also, as a master servicer, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may make certain
representations and warranties regarding the quality of the mortgages and properties underlying a mortgage-backed security. If one or more of those representations or warranties is false, then the holders of the mortgage backed securities could
trigger an obligation of PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable, to repurchase the mortgages from the issuing trust. Finally, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may own securities that are subordinate to the senior
mortgage-backed securities owned by a Fund.</div> <div>Present and
future activities of BlackRock (including BFA) and the Entities and their respective directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</div>

is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund,
manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from
time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory or other services with respect to the Funds. In
addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation
arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement,
for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes,
expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses

<div>For its investment advisory services to the iShares MSCI
Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Peru ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, and iShares MSCI UAE ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund corresponding to the Fund's allocable portion of the
aggregate management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds: iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Chile ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China

Korea ETF, iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF, iShares MSCI Thailand ETF, iShares MSCI Turkey ETF and iShares MSCI UAE ETF. The aggregate management fee is calculated as follows: 0.74% per annum of aggregate net assets less than or equal to $2.0 billion, plus
0.69% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $2.0 billion, up to and including $4.0 billion, plus 0.64% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $4.0 billion, up to and including $8.0 billion, plus 0.57% per annum of the aggregate net assets
over $8.0 billion, up to and including $16.0 billion, plus 0.51% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $16.0 billion, up to and including $24.0 billion, plus 0.48% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $24.0 billion, up to and including
$32.0 billion, plus 0.45% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $32.0 billion.</div>

for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management seeks to track the rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics of independent third-party indexes by either replicating the same combination of
securities and other financial instruments that constitute those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that constitute those indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to
BFA’s policy, investment opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal
constraints or other factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time each Fund may
receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than it would have if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may
pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio’s or
account’s gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or any of its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an
incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees.
Although BFA and each of its affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intend to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and
accounts managed by an investment adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Portfolio Managers' compensation as of August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio
managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year to year based on a number of
factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div>
<div>Base compensation.<font> Generally,
portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.</font></div>
<div>Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, Inc. and the individual's performance and
contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock, Inc.</font></div>
<div>Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. The BlackRock, Inc. restricted
stock units, if properly vested, will be settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Typically, the cash bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of total compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying a portion of annual
bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given year “at risk” based on BlackRock, Inc.'s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods.</font></div>
<div>Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards — <font>From time to time, long-term incentive equity awards are granted to certain key employees to aid in retention, align their interests with long-term shareholder interests and motivate performance. Equity awards are
generally granted in the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units that, once vested, settle in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.</font></div>
<div>Other Compensation Benefits.<font>
In addition to base compensation and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:</font></div>
<div>Incentive Savings Plans<font>
— BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock, Inc. employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“RSP”), and the BlackRock Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution
equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) limit ($275,000 for 2018). The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies and collective investment funds
managed by the firm. BlackRock, Inc. contributions follow the investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into an index target date fund that corresponds to, or is
closest to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock, Inc. common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to
the purchase of 1,000 shares of common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the Purchase Date. Rachel Aguirre, Diane Hsiung, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw are each eligible to participate in
these plans.</font></div> <div>As of August 31, 2018, the Portfolio
Managers beneficially owned shares of the Funds, for which they are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management, in the amounts reflected in the following tables:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Codes of Ethics. <font> The
Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, including securities
that may be purchased or held by the Funds. The codes of ethics are on public file with, and are available from, the SEC.</font></div>
<div>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. <font> The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism or other
illicit activities. Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information
will be used to verify the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font></div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from
persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow a Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose identity it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the Funds'
policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities.</div>
<div>Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.<font>   State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) serves as administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Funds under the Master Services Agreement and related Service Schedule (the
“Service Module”). State Street’s principal address is 1 Lincoln Street, Boston, MA 02111. Pursuant to the Service Module for Fund Administration and Accounting Services with the Trust, State Street provides necessary
administrative, legal, tax and accounting and financial reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each Fund. In addition, State Street makes available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to
provide such services. Pursuant to the Service Module for Custodial Services with the Trust, State Street maintains, in separate accounts, cash, securities and other assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and records and
provides other services. State Street is required, upon the order of the Trust, to deliver securities held by State Street and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. State Street is authorized to appoint certain
foreign custodians or foreign custody managers for Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant to the Service Module for Transfer Agency Services with the Trust, State Street acts as a transfer agent for each Fund’s authorized and issued shares
of beneficial interest, and as dividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As compensation for these services, State Street receives certain out-of-pocket costs, transaction fees and asset-based fees which are accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from
its management fee.</font></div> <div>The following table sets
forth the administration, custodian and transfer agency expenses of each Fund paid by BFA to State Street for the fiscal years noted:</div> <div>

<div>Subsidiary Administrator.
<font> International Financial Services Limited (“IFS”) serves as the Subsidiary's Mauritius administrator. Pursuant to an agreement with IFS, the Subsidiary pays a fee for administrative, legal, tax and
accounting services to IFS for certain shareholder services and for providing office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to provide such services to the Subsidiary.</font></div>
<div>Distributor. <font> The
Distributor's principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Shares are continuously offered for sale by the Funds through the Distributor or its agent only in Creation Units, as described in the applicable Prospectus and below
in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units
</font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50
U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may
be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own
resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it
receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) international equity funds,
such as the Funds, retained 80% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Effective January 1,
2019, (i) international equity funds, such as the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral
investment fees.</div> <div>Under the securities lending program,
the Funds are categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee
arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the business day following the date
that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable international</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>equity fund, pursuant to the securities lending agreement, will receive for
the remainder of that calendar year securities lending income as follows:</div>
<div>(i) 85% of securities lending income (which excludes
collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in the most recent
fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved
list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating the terms of securities
loans, including the amount of fees; </div>
<div>(3) directing the delivery of loaned
securities; </div> <div>(4) monitoring the daily
value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of excess collateral, as necessary; </div>
<div>(5) investing cash collateral received in
connection with any loaned securities; </div>
<div>(6) monitoring distributions on loaned
securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </div>
<div>(7) in the event of default by a borrower
with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that of the loaned securities; and </div>
<div>(8) terminating securities loans and
arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan termination.</div>

related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or
indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded
products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting
systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing
Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise promote the
Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities
believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</font></div>
<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your
salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localizes the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries
and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, FDx Advisors, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann Advisor
Network LLC, LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Advisors Services, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc. and UBS Financial
Services Inc. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed above. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an
amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or
maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA
Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may
receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded
products.</font></div> <div>The Funds may participate in certain
market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity
and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market
maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may
also participate in such programs.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Determination of Net Asset Value</div>
<div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV
for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of securities held by a Fund is as
follows:</font></div> <div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities
exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each, an “Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price on the
Exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain
circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that
there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures approved by the Board (the “Valuation
Procedures”), BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments.
<font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing
services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot
size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days
or less remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as
obtained from independent third-party pricing services. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the
entity, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In
the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of
such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair
value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated
prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market
makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or
that are valued</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent
pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A
Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a
Fund’s books at their face value.</div> <div>Prices obtained
from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the event
that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be
made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</div>
<div>In the event that application of the methods of valuation
discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance with a method approved by the Board as
reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board
or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or
more data service providers.</div> <div>Certain of the securities
acquired by a Fund may be traded on foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized Participants can
neither purchase nor redeem shares of a Fund.</div> <div>Generally,
trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities
used in computing the NAV of a Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations
could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in its Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying
Index.</div> <div>Fair Value.<font> When
market quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BlackRock in accordance
with the Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack
of trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies
significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to
the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred
after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of the assets or liabilities held
by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the markets or in related or highly correlated assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
ADRs, GDRs or ETFs that invest in components of the Underlying Index) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign
asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the
fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock, with input from the BlackRock Investment Strategy
Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In
addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values
assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div> </div>

<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on
which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to
maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values
determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis
of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and
assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the
valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or
liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating
to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the
determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become more stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn
increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or
instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the
reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their
ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, less liquid securities, or other circumstances.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>The Funds
anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of depositary
receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., will
be subject to negotiated commission rates.</div> <div>OTC issues,
including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds
will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will
generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds
will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by
the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x)
such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of
another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop
or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize
investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>Initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of securities
may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one
of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has
identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute
the order.</div> <div>The table below sets forth the brokerage
commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets over those periods or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>None of the Funds paid any brokerage commissions to BRIL, an
affiliate of BFA, or to any other broker-dealer that is part of the BlackRock group of companies, during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be
combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or
about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest
for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the
1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds
will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>

transactions, to the extent consisting of cash, may require a Fund to contemporaneously transact with broker-dealers for purchases of Deposit Securities (as defined below under <font>Fund Deposit</font>) or sales of Fund
Securities (as defined below under <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font>) as applicable. Such transactions with a particular broker-dealer may be conditioned upon the broker-dealer’s agreement to transact at
guaranteed price levels in order to reduce transaction costs the Funds would otherwise incur as a consequence of settling creation or redemption baskets in cash rather than in-kind.<br/> </div>
<div>Following each Fund’s receipt of an order to purchase or
redeem creation or redemption baskets, to the extent such purchases or redemptions consist of a cash portion, the Fund will enter an order with a broker or dealer to purchase or sell the Deposit Securities or Fund Securities, as applicable. The
terms of such order may, depending on the timing of the transaction and certain other factors, require the broker or dealer to guarantee that a Fund will achieve execution of its order at a price at least as favorable to the Fund as the Fund’s
valuation of the Deposit Securities/Fund Securities used for purposes of calculating the NAV applied to the creation or redemption transaction giving rise to the order (the “Execution Performance Guarantee”). Such orders may be placed
with the purchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant in its capacity as a broker-dealer, with its affiliated broker-dealer or with a third-party broker-dealer. The amount payable to each Fund in respect of any Execution Performance Guarantee will
depend on the results achieved by the executing firm and will vary depending on market activity, timing and a variety of other factors.<br/> </div>
<div>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be
honored on orders arising from creation transactions executed by an Authorized Participant or its affiliate as broker-dealer, an Authorized Participant is required to deposit an amount with each Fund (the “Execution Performance
Deposit”). If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price equal to or more favorable than a Fund’s valuation of the Deposit Securities, the Fund receives the benefit of the favorable
executions and returns to the Authorized Participant the Execution Performance Deposit. If, however, the broker-dealer executing the order is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to a Fund’s valuation
of the securities, the Fund retains the portion of the Execution Performance Deposit equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes, brokerage commissions, foreign exchange or other costs) and may require the Authorized
Participant to deposit any additional amount required to cover the full amount of the actual Execution Performance Guarantee.<br/> </div>
<div>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be
honored for brokerage orders arising from redemption transactions executed by an Authorized Participant or its affiliate as broker-dealer, an Authorized Participant agrees to pay the shortfall amount (the “Execution Performance Offset”).
If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price equal to or more favorable than a Fund’s valuation of the Fund Securities, the Fund receives the benefit of the favorable executions and the
Authorized Participant is not called upon to honor the Execution Performance Offset. If, however, the broker-dealer is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to a Fund’s valuation of the securities, the
Fund will be entitled to the portion of the Execution Performance Offset equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes, brokerage commissions, foreign exchange or other costs).<br/> </div>
<div>The circumstances under which the Execution Performance
Guarantee will be used and the expected amount, if any, of any Execution Performance Deposit or Execution Performance Offset for a Fund will be disclosed in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time based

<div>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</div>
<div>Shares.<font>  The Trust
currently consists of more than 270 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font></div>
<div>Each share issued by a fund has a <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and
distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the
shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees
determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an
annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative
voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of
shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of
time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,
c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> <div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain
funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</div>
<div> The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote
of the Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is
required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore,
in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the
Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an
in-kind election for shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned
subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access
to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect
Participants”).</div> <div>Beneficial ownership of shares is
limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as
“Beneficial Owners”) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and
Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may
decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust
shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling
Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the
OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected
through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit

reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a
corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>

the “Cash Funds”), which are generally offered in Creation Units solely for cash), generally consists of Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component
constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents
the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div>

between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the

<div>Each Cash Fund’s current policy is to accept cash in
substitution for the Deposit Securities it might otherwise accept as in-kind consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. A Cash Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit Securities (<font>i.e.</font>, the in-kind
deposit of a designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. If a Cash Fund elects to accept Deposit Securities, a purchaser's delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the Cash

further information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC on each Business Day
prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number of shares of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the
end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made
available.</div> <div>The identity and number of shares of the
Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The
composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to permit or require the
substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not be eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing
process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including
circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or in certain other situations. As noted above, Creation Units of the Cash Funds currently
are available only for cash purchases.</div> <div>Cash Purchase
Method. <font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified (Creation
Units of the Cash Funds are generally offered solely for cash, while Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally offered partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case
of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an
in-kind purchaser. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for cash purchases, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain brokerage, tax,
foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section
of this SAI.</font></div> <div>Procedures for Creation of Creation
Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font>
</font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing
Process”), a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant
Agreement”) (discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered

<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor (an “Authorized Participant”). Such Authorized

<div>next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together
with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the
Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an
Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in
additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The
Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to
transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its
Authorized Participant Agreement.</div> <div>Purchase Orders.<font>   Unless otherwise described below, to initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper
form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any
appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants,
are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation
Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a
weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or
its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the
facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance
with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination
of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized
Participant that placed the order.</div> <div>Each Fund reserves
the absolute right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently
outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences to the
Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii)
circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the
delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</div>
<div>In addition, the Trust may exercise its right to reject any
creation order for shares of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF on any Business Day that is a holiday in the Indian market, but not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market, and certain other holidays during the
settlement cycle for Fund shares, in order to protect Fund shareholders from any dilutive costs that may be associated with the purchase of Deposit Securities in connection with creation orders on such days.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. For the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, iShares
MSCI Peru ETF, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF and iShares MSCI UAE ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two
Business Days after trade date). For the iShares MSCI Argentina and Global Exposure ETF, iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF and iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+3 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, three Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3,
including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3 in order to
accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules (as discussed in Appendix B of this SAI), to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the last day the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other
circumstances.</font></div> <div>To the extent contemplated by an
Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the
undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105%
and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy
Deposit Securities for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The
cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current
procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the
Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div>

Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer, processing and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The
standard creation transaction fee is charged on each Creation Unit created by an Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard creation transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table regardless of the number
of Creation Units being purchased, but may be reduced by each Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the creation are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a purchase consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant
may also be required to pay an additional transaction charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the creation transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of
transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services
of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>Redemption of Creation Units.
<font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on
a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors

<div>substituted) that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or
correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the corresponding Cash
Amount (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund
Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants
and may change from time to time.</div> <div>Unless cash
redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the shares being
redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a Fund
Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized
Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the
event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The Cash Funds generally
redeem Creation Units solely for cash. The Partial Cash Funds generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the
exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds or for the Funds, including the Cash Funds, that are normally redeemed on a cash basis only, when partial or full cash redemptions of
Creation Units are available or specified (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the Cash Funds are generally redeemed solely for cash and Creation Units of the
Partial Cash Funds are generally redeemed partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash
equivalent of the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain
transaction fees and charges for cash redemptions, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution
Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section of this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer, processing and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged on each
Creation Unit redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard redemption transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount shown in the table regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, but may be
reduced by each Fund if transfer and processing expenses associated with the redemption are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee. If a redemption consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to pay an additional
transaction charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the redemption transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized
Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services
of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized
Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The Authorized
Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their particular
broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant
Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors should
allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any

within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or

However, each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2, T+3 or T+4, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the
circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2, T+3 or T+4 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules (as discussed in Appendix B
to this SAI), to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (<font>i.e.</font>, the last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still
receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain other circumstances. Appendix B of this SAI identifies the instances, if any, where more than seven days would be needed to deliver redemption proceeds. Pursuant to an order of the SEC,

receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified
above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and
each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first
registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions
of Creation Units (except that, as noted above, Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds generally will be redeemed partially for cash, with the exception of Creation Units of the Cash Funds, which generally will be redeemed for cash), in the event
that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter, except for the instances
listed in Appendix B to this SAI in which more than seven calendar days would be needed).</div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's
agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the
missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash, in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds, having a value at least equal to 105%
and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing shares. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the day after the date of
submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the
Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. The Authorized
Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the
Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on

<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of

other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div> <div>Taxation on
Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated
by taking the market value of the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon
the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain
or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were
held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div>
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a
Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and, without further legislation, will not apply after 2025. The application of certain provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on a
Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. In addition, legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on their investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual gross income
must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or
forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships
(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at
least 90% of their income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total
assets must be represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater
than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S.
government securities or the securities of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of
the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of
its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely
cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal
Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may
result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A Fund will be
subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its
taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such
income or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than
two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the
aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div>
<div>Excise Tax.<font>  A Fund will
be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12
months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by year-end. In addition, the
minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute
dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero or until their respective expiration dates, whichever occurs
first. Capital loss carryforwards from taxable years beginning after 2010 are not subject to expiration, and short-term and long-term capital loss carryforwards from such taxable years may only be applied against net realized short-term and
long-term capital gains, respectively.</font></div> <div>In the
event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div>
<div>The following Funds had tax basis net capital loss
carryforwards as set forth in the table below as of August 31, 2018, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

of U.S. Shareholders.<font>   Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made.
However, any dividend or distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on
December 31 of such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount
equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event,
the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares
of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their
credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b).
Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or
claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div>Distributions of net
realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other
dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified
dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>requirements, but not in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will
be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution
in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (a) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e.</font>, the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares. <font> Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the
second acquisition. This provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a
Fund’s basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been
equal to market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders.
The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent
permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and
losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and
defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay
dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a
RIC.</font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in so-called
“Section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All Section 1256 contracts
held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value
at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets and
were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term
capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income
or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund
may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</div>
<div>Qualified Dividend Income.
<font> Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend
income, which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is,
in general, dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, non-U.S.
corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S.
(where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada,
China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,
Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</font></div> </div>

<div>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified
dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with
respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding
requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to
a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income received by such REIT or other RIC. In addition, the Tax
Act permits a direct REIT shareholder to claim a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, but does not permit a RIC paying dividends attributable to such income to pass through this special treatment to its
shareholders. Unless future legislation or regulations provide for a pass-through, investors in such a RIC will treat such distributions as ordinary dividend income, as under prior law, whereas a direct REIT investor would benefit from the special
treatment. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. Distributions by a Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as
ordinary income.</div> <div>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum holding

diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to the
investment.</font></div> <div>Issues Related to India and Mauritius
Taxes. <font> The following discussion does not address the effect on investors, including residents of India and citizens of India (whether or not residing in India or other countries, including the U.S.), of
holding shares of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF. Investors should consult their own tax advisors as to these issues based upon their own personal situations.</font></div>
<div>Indian tax matters discussed herein are based on the
provisions of the IT Act, the provisions of the DTAA and other laws currently in force as of the date of this SAI. All such laws and the DTAA are subject to prospective and retroactive legislative amendment, administrative rulings and judicial
review.</div> <div>Each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares
MSCI India Small-Cap ETF invest in India  through its Subsidiary. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Subsidiary has elected to be treated as an entity disregarded from its owner. Thus, for U.S. federal tax purposes, any income or loss
realized by a Subsidiary will be treated as realized by the applicable fund . Therefore, any investment made by each Fund into a Subsidiary and any distributions received by the Fund from a Subsidiary are disregarded for U.S. federal tax purposes.
Furthermore, there is no tax on each Fund's investment in a Subsidiary or on distributions made from a Subsidiary to the Fund .</div>
<div>No investor in the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI
India Small-Cap ETF will be subject to taxation in India unless such investor is a resident of India or, if a non-resident, has an Indian source income or income received (whether accrued or otherwise) in India or triggers the indirect transfer
provisions (discussed below). The IT Act provides for the concept of POEM for the determination of the residency of a foreign company. Accordingly, a company would be said to be resident in India if its POEM is situated in India. POEM is defined as
a place where the key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made. The taxation of a Subsidiary and a Fund in India is governed by the provisions of the IT
Act, read with the provisions of the DTAA. As per Section 90(2) of the IT Act, the provisions of the IT Act would apply to the extent they are more beneficial than the provisions of the DTAA. In order to claim the beneficial provisions of the DTAA,
a Subsidiary must be a tax resident of Mauritius.</div> <div>An
investor is required to submit a TRC as issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and information as prescribed by the Government to claim benefits under the DTAA.</div>

obtained its TRC from the Mauritius authorities that establishes its residency in Mauritius under the DTAA. The TRC must be renewed annually. Each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF expect its Subsidiary to maintain its
Mauritius tax residency, but it cannot be assured that the Mauritius authorities will successfully renew its TRC annually or that it will continue to be eligible to the DTAA benefits, particularly in light of the new requirements that may be
introduced if the DTAA is re-negotiated.</div> <div>Each Subsidiary
holds a Category 1 Global Business License issued by the Financial Services Commission of Mauritius. Each Subsidiary is subject to tax in Mauritius on its net income at the rate of 15%. However, a system of foreign tax credits which allows a tax
credit against Mauritian taxes for foreign tax on a Mauritian entity’s foreign source income effectively reduces the Mauritius income tax rate to a maximum of 3% because the system presumes, in the absence of evidence, that the foreign tax
paid is equal to 80% of the Mauritian tax. Further, a Subsidiary is not subject to capital gains tax in Mauritius nor is it subject to tax in Mauritius on any gains from the sale of securities. Any dividends paid by a Subsidiary to each of the
iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF will also be exempt from tax in Mauritius.</div>
<div>The DTAA gives India the right to tax capital gains that arise
from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident. However, the DTAA also provides for grandfathering of investments in shares made before April 1, 2017. Returns from investments in shares made on or after April 1,
2017 will be subject to capital gains tax in India, although the DTAA provides for a limitation of benefits provision which shall be a prerequisite for a reduced rate of tax (50% of domestic tax rate) on capital gains arising during a two year
transition period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019.</div>
<div>Each Subsidiary will attempt to abide by the requirements of
the DTAA, to maintain its residency in Mauritius, and to ensure that management and control of the Subsidiary remain in Mauritius. Any change in the applicability of the provisions of the DTAA or in its applicability to a Subsidiary could result in
a Subsidiary and indirectly each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF being subject to Indian income taxes, withholding taxes, and other taxes, as well as being subject to administrative or judicial assertion of such
tax liabilities by the tax authorities of India. This could significantly reduce the return of a Fund on its investments in shares and the return received by Fund shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Subsidiary is expected to have income in the form of
capital gains, income from dividends and income from interest. The Indian tax consequences for a Subsidiary on account of the application of the DTAA, read with the provisions of the IT Act, would be as follows (the rates are inclusive of the
highest applicable surcharges):</div> <div>

income earned from June 1, 2013 to June 30, 2020 on rupee-denominated bonds of Indian companies and Government securities, will be subject to tax at the rate of 5.46%, provided that the rate of interest does not exceed the prescribed rates. In the
case of foreign currency-denominated debt obligations, the tax rate is 21.84%. For approved foreign currency loans advanced from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2020, the tax rate on interest is 5.46% and for approved foreign currency long-term bonds

<div>Indian Minimum Alternate Tax</div>
<div>The question of whether foreign companies (which would include

under the IT Act, the company is liable to pay MAT on the adjusted book profits at the rate of 21.55% (inclusive of applicable taxes and surcharges, assuming total income of more than INR 100 million).</div>

<div>The foregoing is based upon current interpretation and
practice and is subject to future changes in the tax laws of India or Mauritius and in the DTAA. Any change in the DTAA's application could have a material adverse effect on the returns of each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India
Small-Cap ETF. Further, it is possible that the Indian tax authorities may seek to take the position that a Fund is not entitled to the benefits of the DTAA.</div>
<div>Indirect Transfers</div>
<div>The current legislation imposes Indian tax and withholding
obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (indirect transfers). It has been clarified that Indian tax authorities will not reopen any
assessment proceedings that were completed before April 1, 2012 and where no notice for reassessment has been issued prior to that date. The CBDT also clarified that any assessment or any other order which stands validated due to the amendments in
the Finance Act would be enforced. Given this clarification issued by the CBDT, the Funds do not expect that shareholders or the Funds will become subject to tax or to withholding obligations with respect to completed assessments.</div>
<div>It has been clarified that the share or interest of the
foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the value of all the assets owned by the foreign entity.
The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, of such an asset without reduction of liabilities. The fair market value will be determined in accordance with the Rule 11UB of the IT Rules. It has been provided that
where all the assets of the foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian assets shall be subject to capital gains tax in India.</div>
<div>Further, it provides exemption from indirect transfer
provisions to the small shareholders of such foreign entity in the following cases:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>With respect to a foreign
entity that holds the Indian assets directly, if the transferor of share or interest in such a foreign entity (along with its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer neither holds the right of control
or management in the foreign entity, nor holds voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in such foreign entity. </td></tr>

interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share capital or total interest in the foreign entity, which results in holding the same share capital or voting power in the entity which directly holds the Indian assets. </td></tr></table>
</div> <div>If the gains arising from transfer of share or interest
in a foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes.</div>
<div>The IT Act provides that aforesaid indirect transfer
provisions will not apply to foreign investors making an investment directly or indirectly in a SEBI registered Category I and Category II FPI.</div>
<div>Under IT Act, gains realized when a non-resident acquires
shares of a foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives “substantial value” from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50% of the
value the company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably attributable to the Indian assets.</div>

Subsidiary, the Subsidiary or the Funds may be considered to derive “substantial value” from Indian assets. Accordingly, shareholder redemptions of Fund/Subsidiary shares and sales of</div> </div>

<div>Fund shares may have been subject to Indian tax and withholding obligations.
However, the IT Act provides for an exemption to shareholders in Category I and Category II FPI from the applicability of indirect transfer taxation. The Subsidiary is a Category II FPI. Therefore, any redemptions or transfers by the Funds or the
shareholders in the Funds should not be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax.</div>
<div>General Anti-Avoidance Rules.</div>
<div>The GAAR introduced in the IT Act provides the Indian tax
authorities a mechanism to deny any tax benefits in a transaction or any other arrangement that is believed to not have any commercial substance or purpose other than to obtain tax benefit(s) under a treaty. The provisions of GAAR will be applicable
to arrangements (including a step in or a part thereof) entered into by a taxpayer, which may be declared as an “impermissible avoidance arrangement”.</div>
<div>CBDT has clarified that where a FPI (such as the Subsidiary)
is located in a particular jurisdiction based on non-tax commercial reasons and the main purpose of the choice of location/residence of the FPI is not to obtain a treaty benefit, the GAAR provisions will not be resorted to by the tax
authorities.</div> <div>As per the provisions of the IT Rules, GAAR
shall not apply in the following circumstances:</div> <div>

aggregate tax benefit to all the parties of the arrangement in the relevant financial year does not exceed INR 30 Million; </td></tr>

<div>If the iShares MSCI India and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap's
use of the Subsidiaries were considered to be such an impermissible avoidance arrangement, the Funds may become subject directly to taxation in India. The burden of proof in enforcing the rule will reside with the Indian government, not the
taxpayer, and India’s current double tax treaty arrangements will remain in force. However, GAAR may, irrespective of existing treaty provisions, lead to the imposition of tax liabilities and withholding obligations, which may lead the Funds
to modify the structure.</div> <div>Recent amendments to DTAA and
GAAR could change the manner in which the Subsidiaries are currently taxed in India and could adversely impact the returns to each of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF/Subsidiaries and their respective shareholders. The
Funds will continue to monitor developments in India with respect to these matters. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to their own tax situations and the tax consequences of an investment in each of the Funds.</div>
<div>Excess Inclusion Income.
<font> Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) from being realized by their tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder
could realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income
received by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to report some or all of its distributions as “excess inclusion income.” To Fund shareholders, such
excess inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii)
not be offset by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain
“disqualified organizations,” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has
UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Investments.
<font> Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated
in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988
gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency,
non-U.S. currency forward contracts and certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also
treated as ordinary income or loss unless a Fund was to elect otherwise.</div>
<div>Each Fund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at
the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to “pass through” to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15
additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not
actually received, the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their deductions
on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.
securities while such securities are lent out by a Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not “passed through” for tax purposes will not be available to shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S.
person invested in the Fund in a year that the Fund elects to “pass through” its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the
investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of non-U.S. taxes paid
by the Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain limitations will be
imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a Fund or to treat Fund
dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain circumstances.
Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.  With respect to Brazil, a 6% Imposto sobre Operacões Financeiras (“IOF”) tax, with the rate subject to change, applies to certain foreign exchange inflows into Brazil. A
previous 1% IOF tax on currency derivatives has been eliminated. A previous 1.5% IOF tax applicable to the creation of new ADR or GDR issuances with respect to Brazilian equities and a previous 0.38% IOF tax applicable to the cancellation of ADRs or
GDRs if the underlying equities are issued in the Brazil (local) markets have been removed. If incurred by the Fund, an IOF tax would not be creditable against U.S. income tax liability.</div>
<div>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. <font> If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed
as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div>
<div>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC
as a “qualified electing fund” under the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified
electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information
from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to
the Fund.</div> <div>Alternatively, a Fund may make a
mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and would deduct any such losses as
ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By
making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to distribute this “phantom” income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible,
and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effects of these rules.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Reporting. <font> If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Other Taxes. <font> Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a
U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations
of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains”
(generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible
dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a
non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> <div>Distributions to certain
foreign shareholders by a Fund at least 50% of the assets of which are “U.S. real property interests” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations) at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the
distributions, to the extent the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations” such as certain REITs, although
exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the
distributions), generally must be treated by such foreign shareholders as income effectively connected to a trade or business within the U.S., which is generally subject to tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, except for
distributions to foreign shareholders that held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the previous one-year period ending on the date of the distributions. Such distributions may be subject to U.S. withholding tax and
may require a foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, sales or redemptions of shares held by certain foreign shareholders in such a Fund generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax and generally will require
the foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return, although exceptions may apply if more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s shares are held by U.S. shareholders or the foreign shareholder selling or redeeming the shares has
held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or redemption.</div>
<div>Provided that more than 50% of the value of a Fund’s
stock is held by U.S. shareholders, redemptions and other distributions made in the form of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations”, although exceptions may apply if any class
of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the</div> </div>

portion of any unrecognized gain in the U.S. real property interests equal to the product of (i) the excess of fair market value of such U.S. real property interests over the Fund’s adjusted bases in such interests and (ii) the greatest
foreign ownership percentage of the Fund during the five-year period ending on the date of distribution.</div>
<div>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items, and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to: (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer
identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will

<div>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S.
federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of investing in such shares, including consequences under

<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to
investors in the respective countries listed below:</div> <div>

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock helps investors build better financial futures. As a
fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies,
asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world.</div>
<div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock’s Investment Stewardship activities are
focused on protecting and enhancing the economic value of the companies in which we invest on behalf of clients. We do this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us authority,
through voting at shareholder meetings.</div> <div>We believe that
there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests.
Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate
charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment including but not limited to changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the
distribution of income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of
directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership
to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote
at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded
adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our approach to engaging with
companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual
companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific
assessments.</div> <div>We believe BlackRock has a responsibility
in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the
best long-term economic interests of shareholders and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long-term shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have
appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a team profile on our website.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

<div>At a minimum, we expect companies to observe the accepted
corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the
best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the
company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long-term economic interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external
research.</div> <div>BlackRock views engagement as an important
activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of investee companies and their governance structures to better inform our voting decisions. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and approach to
investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a
range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock takes an engagement-first approach, emphasizing
direct dialogue with companies on governance issues that have a material impact on financial performance. We generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a
long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a
company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies,
or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek
to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

<div>seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about
the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the company, or the performance of individual board members.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order for
shareholders to assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>

<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>having
 any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the board is enhanced
when there is a clearly independent, senior non-executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the
independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to
shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe
that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a
significant adverse event.</div> <div>Auditors and audit-related
issues</div> <div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of
financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor.</div>
<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales and other special
transactions</div> <div>The capital structure of a company is
critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders
against the dilution of their interests.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership
and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting company value, and voting power should match
economic exposure.</div> <div>We are concerned that the creation of
a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share, one vote principle is designed to
mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such companies should review these dual-class structures on a regular
basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated
shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales or other special
transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction
to determine the degree to which it enhances long-term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that
executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would
expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be
subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take
into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions
consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a clear link between
variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees
can help ensure competitive pay; however we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of
results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long-term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div>
<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of
the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>It is within this context of our fiduciary duty to clients
that we undertake our investment stewardship activities. Sound practices in relation to the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors inherent in the business model can be a signal of operational excellence and management
quality.</div> <div>BlackRock expects companies to identify and
report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and
enhances the long-term economic value of the company. E&amp;S factors are material if they are core to how the business operates. The key performance indicators in relation to E&amp;S factors should also be disclosed and performance against them
discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the material E&amp;S factors relevant to the business. Any generally recognized best practices
and reporting standards adopted by the company should also be discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and
regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where local laws or regulations that significantly impact the company’s operations are contradictory or ambiguous to global norms.</div>
<div>Given that E&amp;S factors are often not issues on which a
shareholder votes, we will engage directly with the board or management. Engagement on a particular E&amp;S factor is based on our assessment that there are potential material economic ramifications for shareholders over the long-term.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with material E&amp;S factors appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or
realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will assess whether the company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern and whether there is a clear
and material economic disadvantage to the company if the issue is not addressed.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters and shareholder
protections</div> <div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the
right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP
ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high standard in our investment
stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who do not have other responsibilities other than their roles
in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees
(“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with
practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees,
the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global
Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of
BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global
Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews
periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by
the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and
executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions
to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial
matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s
affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an
exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues
which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s
ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share-blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in
proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are
not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as shareblocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with shareblocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each year we publish an annual report, an annual engagement and voting statistics report, and our full voting record to our website. On a quarterly basis, we publish
regional reports which provide an overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting activities during the quarter, including market developments, speaking engagements, and engagement and voting statistics. Additionally, we make public our
market-specific voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage.</div>
<div>Appendix A4 – Supplemental BlackRock Sustainable Proxy
Voting Guidelines</div> <div>September 28, 2018</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well-managed companies will deal effectively
with the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses.</div>
<div>BIS expects companies to identify and report on the material,
business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and enhances the long-term
economic value of the company. The key performance indicators in relation to E&amp;S matters should also be disclosed and performance against them discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps
shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the material E&amp;S factors relevant to the business. Any global standards adopted should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S issues appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm
to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S matters. In deciding our course of action, we will assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div>

taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>

<td>The company is in the
process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>

 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BIS may vote against shareholder proposals that, in our
assessment, are too prescriptive or narrowly focused, deal with issues we consider to be the purview of the board or management, or where the company is already reporting in the spirit of the shareholder proposals even if not in its exact
format.</div> <div>In certain instances, BIS may instruct E&amp;S
shareholder proposals differently for different funds. This “split vote” will be based on BIS’ assessment of the materiality of the underlying issues in conjunction with an assessment that clients invested in the ESG funds may
expect more urgent action be taken by the company. In our view, it is reasonable to expect that clients invested in ESG funds may be less patient with regard to evolution in corporate policies on material E&amp;S matters and therefore wish to send a
stronger signal to the company by supporting a shareholder proposal.</div>
<div>Environmental shareholder proposals:</div>
<div>Climate risks and opportunities:</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk”, we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities to many companies. We believe that the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on
Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) sector-specific disclosure standards provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on
climate-related risks and opportunities. We expect companies to help their investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate change and to convey their governance around this issue through their corporate disclosures. For companies in
sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business, and how management mitigates that risk. Shareholder proposals related to climate risk,
include, but are not limited to: the need for greater reporting on GHG emissions; how the company’s strategy would fare under a 2 degree scenario;<sup>1</sup>
the transition to a lower carbon economy (including greater integration of renewable energy etc.); and the company’s management of methane or other GHG emissions.</div>
<div>In assessing these proposals, we take into consideration the
factors laid out above, as well as the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures and our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time.</div>
<div>Sustainability Disclosures</div>
<div>As set forth above, BIS expects companies to identify and
report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This includes how the company is assessing risks to the natural environment as a result, directly, or indirectly, of its operations. This
may include impacts to forests, species, water, air, as well as the impact of waste, and of product life-cycle management. We believe that SASB’s sector-specific disclosure standards provide useful guidance to companies on identifying,
managing, and reporting on material sector-specific sustainability issues. Using SASB as a guide, where necessary, we will engage with companies to understand their oversight and management of material sustainability factors. Where there is a
shareholder proposal related to a matter of environmental sustainability, we will assess the quality of the company’s existing disclosures, the information gleaned through engagement, and the fund’s timeframe for change in reaching a
decision on how to vote.</div> <div>Social and political shareholder
proposals:</div> <div>Data Privacy and cybersecurity:</div>
<div>BIS views cybersecurity as a significant enterprise-wide risk
that can impact all levels of a company’s operational activities. Managing this risk is essential to preserving corporate value over time. We assess cybersecurity risk as one component of a company’s broader risk management and oversight
responsibility. In any engagement related to risk, we seek to understand a company’s governance and strategy around the issue; the board’s oversight of management and the company’s processes; and the company’s disclosures
regarding its preparedness to manage a risk-related event if and when one occurs. Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to cybersecurity and data privacy accountability, we will review the company’s existing disclosures and
take into account our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time.</div>

<div>A company’s approach to human capital management –
employee development, diversity and a commitment to equal employment opportunity, health and safety, labor relations, and supply chain labor standards, amongst other things – will vary across sectors but are a factor in business continuity and
success. In light of evolving market trends like shortages of skilled labor, uneven wage growth, and technology that is transforming the labor market, many companies and investors consider having a high standard of human capital management a
competitive advantage. In our engagement on these factors, we seek to ensure companies are adopting the sound business practices likely to create an engaged and stable workforce. As part of the engagement, we are interested to know if, and how,
boards oversee and work with management to improve performance in these areas. Such engagement also provides a lens into the company’s culture, long-term operational risk management practices, and, more broadly, the quality of the
board’s oversight.</div> <div>BIS is aware that disclosure of
information on HCM is still evolving and that the way HCM risks manifest themselves may vary by industry and market. We are members of the Investor Advisory Group of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which provides
industry-specific HCM metrics. We encourage companies to aim over time to go beyond commentaries and provide more transparency on their practices. Investors recognize that most companies are already in possession of HCM data on their workforce, but
are cautious of disclosing this information. We believe that both qualitative and quantifiable indicators can help effectively distinguish companies that are managing this important driver of value in their business. Where a company receives a
shareholder proposal related to reporting on Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), board diversity or pay disparity, we will take into account the company’s current disclosures as well as any insight we receive through our engagements with the
company and board members in reaching a decision on how to vote.</div> <hr noshade="noshade"/>

<div>Human Rights</div>
<div>BIS believes that companies with strong corporate governance
practices are more likely to manage the material environmental and social risks facing the company. To that end, we expect management and the board to oversee the health and safety of its workers, their working conditions, adherence to applicable
labor and anti-discrimination laws, work day length and minimum wage best practices. Companies should also understand and manage their impact on communities, including lower income and indigenous populations. We expect companies and board to be able
to explain their oversight of human rights-related issues. We expect that companies have policies in place to review their practices and supply chains and to have processes to institute corrective action where necessary. We also expect companies to
be in compliance with international standards such as the UN Global Compact, where applicable, and we will take into account any violations thereof in the context of our engagement and voting decisions.</div>
<div>Opioids:</div>
<div>Companies involved in the manufacture and distribution of
opioids have come under increasing scrutiny over their ability to manage the financial and reputational risks associated with their products. We believe financial and reputational consequences of litigation, adverse publicity, and regulatory actions
and investigations have the potential to impact these companies’ long-term financial performance. Through engagement with such companies, we assess the robustness of management’s approach to setting strategy around drug pricing, drug
access, marketing, supply chain management, and public education around controlled substances. We also evaluate board oversight of reputational and legal risks facing the company, as well as the process and frequency by which the board is informed
about corporate policies and procedures related to oversight of opioid-related risks. Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to reporting or overseeing opioid-related risk, or proposals related to reviewing drug pricing or
distribution practices, our assessment will take into account factors discussed above, and any knowledge gained from our engagement with the company and board members, as well as the time frame needed for change.</div>
<div>Product safety, supply chains and distribution channels:</div>
<div>Companies in certain industries, such as the food and
pharmaceutical sectors, may need to mitigate financial risks associated with their products, supply chains and/or their distribution channels. Where appropriate, BIS expects companies to disclose how they are addressing these risks for themselves
and for their distributors, for example, by their participation in industry groups and/or initiatives or through certification by reputable organizations. Where a company receives a shareholder proposal on topics such as: animal welfare, animal
testing, removal of antibiotic or genetically modified organism use in the supply chain or use of non-recycling packaging, we will assess the materiality of the issue to the company’s business, review</div> </div>

<div>Corporate political activities:</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder proposals requesting increased
disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view of the associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards and
management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may determine to support a shareholder proposal requesting
additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or actual harm to shareholders’ interests and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with
sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk. Finally, we believe that it is not the role of shareholders to suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting
a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Appendix B - Regular Holidays and Redemptions</div>
<div>Regular Holidays.<font>  For
every occurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the applicable non-U.S. market that are not holidays observed in the U.S. equity market, the redemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such intervening holidays. In addition
to holidays, other unforeseeable closings in a non-U.S. market due to emergencies and delivery cycles for transferring securities to redeeming investors may also prevent the Trust from delivering securities within the normal settlement
period.</font></div> <div>The securities delivery cycles
currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming investors, coupled with non-U.S. market holiday schedules, will require a delivery process longer than seven calendar days, in certain circumstances. The holidays
applicable to each Fund during such periods are listed below, as are instances where more than seven days will be needed to deliver redemption proceeds. Although certain holidays may occur on different dates in subsequent years, the number of days
required to deliver redemption proceeds in any given year is not expected to exceed the maximum number of days listed below for each Fund. The proclamation of new holidays, the treatment by market participants of certain days as “informal
holidays” (<font>e.g.</font>, days on which no or limited securities transactions occur, as a result of substantially shortened trading hours), the elimination of existing holidays, or changes in
local securities delivery practices, could affect the information set forth herein in the future.</div>
<div>In calendar years 2018 and 2019 (the only years for which
holidays are known at the time of filing of this SAI), the dates of regular holidays affecting the relevant securities markets in which a Fund invests are as follows (please note that these holiday schedules are subject to potential changes in the
relevant securities markets):</div> </div> <div type="Block">

cycles are based on information regarding regular holidays available as of January 18, 2019, which may be out of date as of the date of this SAI. Based on changes in holidays, longer (worse) redemption cycles are possible. Further, regional
holidays, the treatment by market participants of certain days as unofficial holidays (including days on which no or limited securities transactions occur as a result of substantially shortened trading hours), the elimination of existing holidays,
or changes in local securities delivery practices, could affect the information set forth herein. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
