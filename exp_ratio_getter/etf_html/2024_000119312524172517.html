Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for </span><span>investment purposes) in securities or other instruments that provide exposure to securities of large capitalization companies or that provide </span><span>for the upside limit on gains or the downside protection against the losses of securities of large capitalization companies. For purposes of the </span><span>Fund’s 80% policy, </span><span>“</span><span>large capitalization companies</span><span>”</span><span> are those within the range of capitalization of the Underlying ETF’s underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund principally buys shares of the Underlying ETF and customized put options thereon and sells call options that reference the </span><span>Underlying ETF. The options in which the Fund transacts (typically, equity or index exchange-traded options contracts) are referred to </span><span>generally as Flexible Exchange Options (</span><span>“</span><span>FLEX Options</span><span>”</span><span>). The Fund may transact in other listed options that reference the price performance </span><span>of the Underlying ETF, the Underlying ETF’s underlying index, or other exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) that track the Underlying ETF’s </span><span>underlying index (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>exchange-traded options</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund intends to maximize protection against loss through the Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2% minimum Approximate Cap as </span><span>further described below. While the Fund typically seeks to provide against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses for each applicable </span><span>Hedge Period, the Fund will reduce the Approximate Buffer below 100% to provide an Approximate Cap of at least 2% during each Hedge </span><span>Period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Underlying ETF is an ETF that seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying ETF’s Index, which measures the performance of </span><span>the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>SPDJI</span><span>”</span><span>). The securities in the </span><span>Underlying ETF’s Index are weighted based on the float-adjusted market value of their outstanding shares. The Underlying ETF’s Index </span><span>consists of securities from a broad range of industries. The components of the Underlying ETF’s Index are likely to change over time. BFA is </span><span>the investment adviser to the Underlying ETF and receives a management fee from the Underlying ETF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Underlying ETF is managed using a representative sampling indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Representative sampling</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy that </span><span>involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable </span><span>underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market </span><span>capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to </span><span>those of an applicable underlying index. The Underlying ETF may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying ETF’s Index, which may </span><span>cause the performance of the Underlying ETF to diverge from that of the Underlying ETF's Index. Representative sampling may subject the </span><span>Underlying ETF to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error</span><span>”</span><span>, which is the divergence of the Underlying ETF’s performance from that of the Underlying ETF’s Index. This </span><span>risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. The prospectus and other reports of </span><span>the Underlying ETF (Ticker: IVV) are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at </span><span>www.sec.gov</span><span>.

Like traditional exchange-traded options, FLEX Options are </span><span>guaranteed for settlement by the Options Clearing Corporation (the </span><span>“</span><span>OCC</span><span>”</span><span>), a market clearinghouse that guarantees performance by </span><span>counterparties to certain derivatives contracts by becoming the </span><span>“</span><span>buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer</span><span>”</span><span>. The OCC may make </span><span>adjustments to FLEX Options for certain significant events. The FLEX Options in which the Fund invests are European style, which are </span><span>exercisable at the strike price only on the expiration date. The FLEX Options traded by the Fund are listed on an exchange, including the </span><span>Chicago Board Options Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>CBOE</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Options positions are marked to market daily by the Fund. The value of the FLEX Options in which the Fund invests is affected by changes in </span><span>the value and dividend rates of the securities held by the Underlying ETF, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived </span><span>volatility of the Underlying ETF’s Index and the remaining time to such options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. </span><span>The Fund will typically trade options that expire at or around the end of each annual period or </span><span>“</span><span>Hedge Period</span><span>”</span><span> (April 1 through March 31), </span><span>subject to the annual rebalancing process described below. The Fund will be indefinitely offered and is not intended to terminate after one or </span><span>more Hedge Periods.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For each Hedge Period, the Fund obtains exposure to the share price return of the Underlying ETF by purchasing shares of the Underlying ETF </span><span>and futures that reference the price performance of the Underlying ETF’s Index, and creates the Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap by </span><span>trading a combination of put and call exchange-traded options. Specifically, the Fund typically creates the Approximate Buffer by buying a put </span><span>option with the strike price approximately at-the-money relative to the Underlying ETF’s share price. The Fund simultaneously writes a call </span><span>option with a higher strike price relative to the Underlying ETF’s share price to collect a premium that it uses to offset the premium paid to </span><span>buy the put option. The call subjects the Fund to the Approximate Cap as it limits the Fund’s ability to realize any increase in the value of the </span><span>Underlying ETF above the strike price. The Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period is based on the strike price of the capped call for that </span><span>Hedge Period. The Fund’s market value and NAV may not correlate with the Underlying ETF and Underlying ETF’s Index, especially during </span><span>each Hedge Period. The strike prices for the capped calls will change for each Hedge Period depending on the prevailing market conditions </span><span>and the cost of the put option for that Hedge Period, resulting in a different Approximate Cap for each Hedge Period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund will typically buy Underlying ETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF’s Index and seek to enter into the combination of options </span><span>transactions described above if there are any inflows, or creation transactions, during a Hedge Period. This will occur even in circumstances </span><span>where the Fund would receive a negligible premium for writing an out-of-the-money call which may potentially give up more sizable returns to </span><span>the extent that the option later becomes in the money. Because the Fund will effectively use distributions from the Underlying ETF to </span><span>purchase the downside protection, the Fund’s performance is likely to be less than the Underlying ETF’s performance when (1) distributions </span><span>are considered and (2) the Underlying ETF’s performance is positive.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to obtain economic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in lieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and futures on the Underlying ETF’s </span><span>Index for a Hedge Period, the Fund may instead, among other things: purchase call options with a strike price that is very low (approximately </span><span>1% or less) relative to the Underlying ETF’s share price on the day of purchase (a </span><span>“</span><span>zero strike call</span><span>”</span><span>); purchase one or more other ETFs that </span><span>seek to track the Underlying ETF’s Index; purchase equity securities (e.g., component securities of the Underlying ETF’s Index) in seeking to </span><span>track the share price return of the Underlying ETF; or invest in U.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or other cash equivalents and </span><span>purchase or sell a combination of call and put options that seek to synthesize the economic characteristics of the Underlying ETF. If the Fund </span><span>invests in equity securities (other than the Underlying ETF), the Fund’s equity security investments will be primarily in common stocks of </span><span>companies held by the Underlying ETF that BFA believes will provide a risk/ return profile similar to that of the Underlying ETF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the current Hedge Period of April 1 through March 31, the Approximate Cap is [__]% prior to taking into account any fees or expenses </span><span>charged to or transaction costs incurred by the Fund or Underlying ETF. When the Fund’s annualized management fee of 0.50% of the Fund’s </span><span>average daily net assets is taken into account, the Approximate Cap for the current Hedge Period is reduced to [__]%. The returns that the </span><span>Fund seeks to provide also do not include the costs associated with purchasing shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Approximate Buffer that the Fund typically seeks to provide is against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses for the applicable </span><span>Hedge Period; however, there is no guarantee that the Approximate Buffer will succeed in providing the intended protection. The </span><span>Approximate Buffer is provided prior to taking into account any fees or expenses charged to the Fund. These fees and any expenses will </span><span>reduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund shareholders for a Hedge Period. When the Fund’s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of </span><span>the Fund’s daily net assets is taken into account for a Hedge Period, the net Approximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is 99.5%. While the </span><span>Fund typically seeks to provide against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge Period and will maximize the </span><span>Approximate Buffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate Buffer, including below 100%, to provide an Approximate Cap of at least 2%.

Information on the Approximate </span><span>Cap and Approximate Buffer will be provided shortly before each Hedge Period.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.</span><span> </span><span>An investor that purchases Fund shares after the beginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund shares before the end of a Hedge Period, may </span><span>not fully realize the Approximate Buffer or Approximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may be exposed to greater risk of loss and less </span><span>potential gain. This is because while the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the Hedge Period are fixed levels that are calculated in </span><span>relation to the Underlying ETF price and the Fund’s NAV at the start of each Hedge Period and generally remain constant throughout the </span><span>Hedge Period, an investor purchasing Fund shares at market price during the Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares at a price that is </span><span>different from the Fund’s NAV at the start of the Hedge Period (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the NAV that the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer reference). </span><span>For example, if an investor purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has increased from </span><span>its price at the beginning of the Hedge Period, the investor’s upside limit may be lower than the Approximate Cap and the investor may </span><span>experience losses prior to reaching the downside protection offered by the Approximate Buffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases Fund </span><span>shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has decreased from its price at the beginning of the Hedge </span><span>Period, the Fund may require a larger increase in the Underlying ETF’s share price before it reaches the Approximate Cap. The Approximate </span><span>Cap and Approximate Buffer, and the Fund’s position relative to each, which are typically available on iShares.com daily, should be </span><span>considered before investing in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return may be subject to an upside limit significantly below the Approximate Cap and </span><span>downside protection significantly lower than the Approximate Buffer. An investor may lose their entire investment and an investment in the </span><span>Fund is only appropriate for investors willing to bear those losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Following the close of business on the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund will file a prospectus supplement that discloses the Fund’s </span><span>Approximate Cap (gross and net of the unitary management fee) for the next Hedge Period.

The returns </span><span>that the Fund seeks to provide also do not include the costs associated with purchasing shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>The Approximate Buffer that the Fund typically seeks to provide is against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses for the applicable </span><span>Hedge Period; however, there is no guarantee that the Approximate Buffer will succeed in providing the intended protection. The </span><span>Approximate Buffer is provided prior to taking into account any fees or expenses charged to the Fund. These fees and any expenses will </span><span>reduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund shareholders for a Hedge Period. When the Fund’s annual management fee equal to 0.50% of </span><span>the Fund’s daily net assets is taken into account for a Hedge Period, the net Approximate Buffer for the Hedge Period is 99.5%. While the </span><span>Fund typically seeks to provide against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses for the applicable Hedge Period and will maximize the </span><span>Approximate Buffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate Buffer, including below 100%, to provide an Approximate Cap of at least 2%. For </span><span>example, if interest rates are low enough that providing against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses would result in an Approximate </span><span>Cap of less than 2%, the Fund would decrease the protection such that the Approximate Cap is at least 2%. Information on the Approximate </span><span>Cap and Approximate Buffer will be provided shortly before each Hedge Period.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap for a Hedge Period only apply to Fund shares held over the entire Hedge Period.</span><span> </span><span>An investor that purchases Fund shares after the beginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund shares before the end of a Hedge Period, may </span><span>not fully realize the Approximate Buffer or Approximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may be exposed to greater risk of loss and less </span><span>potential gain. This is because while the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for the Hedge Period are fixed levels that are calculated in </span><span>relation to the Underlying ETF price and the Fund’s NAV at the start of each Hedge Period and generally remain constant throughout the </span><span>Hedge Period, an investor purchasing Fund shares at market price during the Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares at a price that is </span><span>different from the Fund’s NAV at the start of the Hedge Period (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the NAV that the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer reference). </span><span>For example, if an investor purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has increased from </span><span>its price at the beginning of the Hedge Period, the investor’s upside limit may be lower than the Approximate Cap and the investor may </span><span>experience losses prior to reaching the downside protection offered by the Approximate Buffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases Fund </span><span>shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has decreased from its price at the beginning of the Hedge </span><span>Period, the Fund may require a larger increase in the Underlying ETF’s share price before it reaches the Approximate Cap. The Approximate </span><span>Cap and Approximate Buffer, and the Fund’s position relative to each, which are typically available on iShares.com daily, should be </span><span>considered before investing in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return may be subject to an upside limit significantly below the Approximate Cap and </span><span>downside protection significantly lower than the Approximate Buffer. An investor may lose their entire investment and an investment in the </span><span>Fund is only appropriate for investors willing to bear those losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Following the close of business on the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund will file a prospectus supplement that discloses the Fund’s </span><span>Approximate Cap (gross and net of the unitary management fee) for the next Hedge Period. The Fund’s Approximate Cap (net of the unitary </span><span>management fee) for the current Hedge Period, along with Fund’s position relative to the Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap, will be </span><span>available on the Fund’s website, </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading </span><span>price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. Each Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or indirectly through </span><span>the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Funds, and the Funds could underperform </span><span>other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.  Each Fund discloses its </span><span>portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Affiliated Fund Risk.</span><span> In managing the Funds, BFA has the ability to select Underlying Funds and substitute Underlying Funds with other ETFs </span><span>that it believes will achieve each Fund’s objective. BFA may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in selecting Underlying Funds and </span><span>substituting Underlying Funds with other ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs managed by BFA may </span><span>be higher than the fees paid by other Underlying Funds.</span><span> </span><span>This risk may be reduced to the extent BFA has agreed to waive Acquired Fund Fees </span><span>and Expenses with respect to the Underlying Fund. If an Underlying Fund or other ETF holds interests in an affiliated fund, the Funds may be </span><span>prohibited from purchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or other ETF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap Change Risk.</span><span> The Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap are dependent on prevailing </span><span>market conditions (</span><span>e.g.</span><span> volatility, interest rates, dividends, and other factors). As such, the Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap may rise </span><span>or fall from one Hedge Period to the next, sometimes to a significant extent, and are unlikely to remain the same for consecutive Hedge </span><span>Periods.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities and other assets in a Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to indexes that track, or assets that </span><span>represent, other countries or geographic units, industries, markets, market segments, or asset classes. Various types of securities, other </span><span>assets and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to financial markets generally. This </span><span>divergence may be due to a number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local </span><span>products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause a Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, a Fund’s adviser, an affiliate </span><span>of a Fund’s adviser, or another fund may invest in a Fund and hold its investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve </span><span>size or scale. There can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly </span><span>with a Fund. There are a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants for the Fund, including on an agency basis on </span><span>behalf of other market participants. No Authorized Participant is obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. To the extent </span><span>that Authorized Participants exit the business or do not place creation or redemption orders for a Fund and no other Authorized Participant </span><span>places orders, Fund shares are more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized </span><span>Participant concentration risk may be heightened for a Fund that invests in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or instruments with lower </span><span>trading volume. Such assets often entail greater settlement and operational complexity and higher capital costs for Authorized Participants, </span><span>which may limit the number of Authorized Participants that engage with the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buffered Loss Risk.</span><span>There can be no guarantee that the Fund will be successful in its strategy to provide downside protection against </span><span>Underlying ETF losses. The Fund does not provide principal protection or non-principal protection, and, despite the Approximate Buffer, an </span><span>investor may experience significant losses on their investment, including the loss of their entire investment. In the event an investor </span><span>purchases Fund shares after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to the end of the Hedge Period, the Approximate Buffer that </span><span>the Fund seeks to provide may not be available. In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return may be subject to downside </span><span>protection significantly lower than the Approximate Buffer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capped Upside Return Risk.</span><span>The Fund’s strategy seeks to provide returns that are subject to an Approximate Cap. The Approximate Cap </span><span>represents an approximate maximum percentage return that an investor can achieve from an investment in the Fund held over an entire </span><span>Hedge Period. In the event that the Underlying ETF experiences gains in excess of the upside limit to which the Fund is subject as a result of </span><span>the capped call for a Hedge Period, the Fund will not participate in those gains beyond the upside limit. In the event an investor purchases </span><span>Fund shares after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to the end of a Hedge Period, there may be little or no ability for that </span><span>investor to experience an investment gain on their Fund shares. In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return may be subject to </span><span>an upside limit significantly below the Approximate Cap.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Clearing Member Default Risk. </span><span>Transactions in some types of derivatives, including FLEX Options and futures, are required to be centrally </span><span>cleared (</span><span>“</span><span>cleared derivatives</span><span>”</span><span>). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house, such as the OCC, </span><span>rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (</span><span>“</span><span>clearing members</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. In cleared </span><span>derivatives positions, the Fund will make payments (including margin payments) to and receive payments from a clearing house through their </span><span>accounts at clearing members. Customer funds held at a clearing organization in connection with any options contracts are held in a </span><span>commingled omnibus account and are not identified to the name of the clearing member’s individual customers. As a result, assets </span><span>deposited by the Fund with any clearing member as margin for FLEX Options or futures may, in certain circumstances, be used to satisfy </span><span>losses of other clients of the Fund’s clearing member. In addition, although clearing members guarantee performance of their clients’ </span><span>obligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's or the Underlying ETF's clearing house, there is a risk that the assets of the Fund might not be </span><span>fully protected in the event of the clearing member’s bankruptcy, as the Fund would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all </span><span>available funds segregated on behalf of the clearing member’s customers for the relevant account class. The Fund is also subject to the risk </span><span>that a limited number of clearing members are willing to transact on the Fund’s behalf, which heightens the risks associated with a clearing </span><span>member’s default. If a clearing member defaults, the Fund could lose some or all of the benefits of a transaction entered into by the Fund </span><span>with the clearing member. If the Fund cannot find a clearing member to transact with on the Fund’s behalf, the Fund may be unable to </span><span>effectively implement its investment strategy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> A Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s </span><span>investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund’s investments are concentrated in the securities or other assets of </span><span>one or more issuers, countries or other geographic units, markets, industries, project types, or asset classes. A Fund with investment </span><span>concentration may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those assets, may experience greater price volatility and may be </span><span>more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory impacts on those assets compared to a fund that does not concentrate </span><span>its investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Counterparty Risk. </span><span>Derivatives are subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will be unable or </span><span>unwilling to fulfill its contractual obligation, and the related risks of having concentrated exposure to such a counterparty. The OCC acts as </span><span>guarantor and central counterparty with respect to the FLEX Options. As a result, the ability of the Fund to meet its objective depends on the </span><span>OCC being able to meet its obligations. In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement </span><span>obligations, the Fund could suffer significant losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> A Fund and entities that interact with the Fund are susceptible to operational, information security and related </span><span>cybersecurity risks, both directly and through their service providers. These entities include, but are not limited to, a Fund’s adviser, </span><span>distributor, other service providers (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., index and benchmark providers, accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), </span><span>counterparties, market makers, Authorized Participants, listing exchanges, other financial market operators, and governmental authorities. </span><span>Cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities or other assets in which a Fund invests, which could result in material adverse </span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate </span><span>attacks or unintentional events. They include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to systems, misappropriating assets or </span><span>sensitive information, corrupting or destroying data, and causing operational disruption. Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions and impact business operations and may result in any of the following: financial losses, </span><span>interference with a Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of a Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations </span><span>of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and </span><span>other legal and compliance expenses. In addition, cyber incidents may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder </span><span>ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to a Fund’s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. A Fund may incur </span><span>substantial costs in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, cyber incidents. However, </span><span>there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention </span><span>and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyber incidents will go undetected. Furthermore, a Fund cannot control the </span><span>cybersecurity plans and systems of its service providers, counterparties, and other third parties whose activities affect the Fund. A Fund and </span><span>its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Derivatives Risk. </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset such </span><span>as a security or an index. Each Fund</span><span> </span><span>and Underlying Fund may invest in certain types of derivatives contracts, including futures, options and </span><span>swaps. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in </span><span>market prices and thus a Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in </span><span>conventional securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> Equity securities are subject to changes in value due to general market or economic conditions, perceptions about </span><span>the markets in which issuers participate or a number of factors relating to a specific issuer. Investments in equity securities may be more </span><span>volatile than investments in other asset classes. Equity securities (both common and preferred stock) are subordinated to debt securities in a </span><span>company’s capital structure, and so equity holders are generally subject to more risks, particularly in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy. </span><span>Common stock has the lowest priority and the greatest risks, including with respect to dividends and any liquidation payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>FLEX Options Risk</span><span>. In addition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options are subject to the risk that they may be less liquid than certain other </span><span>securities, such as standardized options. In less liquid markets for the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX Options may require the payment </span><span>of a premium or acceptance of a discounted price and may take longer to complete. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the </span><span>liquidation of a large number of options may significantly impact the price of the options and may adversely impact the value of your </span><span>investment. Additionally, to the extent market participants are not willing or able to enter into FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at </span><span>prices that reflect the market price of the Fund shares, the Fund’s NAV and, in turn the share price of the Fund, could be negatively impacted.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FLEX Options held by the Fund will be exercisable at the strike price only on their expiration date. As an in-the-money FLEX Option </span><span>approaches its expiration date, its value typically will increasingly move with the value of the Underlying ETF. However, the value of the FLEX </span><span>Options prior to the expiration date may vary because of related factors other than the value of the Underlying ETF. The value of the FLEX </span><span>Options will be determined based upon market quotations or using other recognized pricing methods. Factors that may influence the value of </span><span>the FLEX Options generally include interest rate changes, dividends, the actual and implied volatility levels of the Underlying ETF’s share </span><span>price, and the remaining time until the FLEX Options expire, among others. The value of the FLEX Options held by the Fund typically do not </span><span>increase or decrease at the same rate as the Underlying ETF’s share price on a day-to-day basis due to these factors (although they generally </span><span>move in the same direction), and, as a result, the Fund’s NAV may not increase or decrease at the same rate as the Underlying ETF’s share </span><span>price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures Contract Risk. </span><span>Futures are standardized, exchange-traded contracts that obligate a purchaser to take delivery, and a seller to make </span><span>delivery, of a specific amount of an asset at a specified future date at a specified price. Unlike equities, which typically entitle the holder to a </span><span>continuing ownership stake in an issuer, futures contracts normally specify a certain date for settlement in cash based on the level of the </span><span>reference rate. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are: (i) the imperfect correlation between the change in market </span><span>value of the instruments  held by the Fund and the price of the futures contract; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures </span><span>contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired; (iii) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which </span><span>are potentially unlimited; (iv) BFA's inability to predict correctly the direction of prices and other economic factors; and (v) the possibility that </span><span>the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hedge Period Risk. </span><span>The Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap for a Hedge Period apply to Fund shares held over the entire Hedge </span><span>Period. In the event an investor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to the end of the Hedge Period, </span><span>the returns realized by the investor will not match those that the Fund seeks to provide.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Objective Risk. </span><span>Certain circumstances under which the Fund might not achieve its objective include, but are not limited, to (i) if </span><span>the Fund disposes of exchange-traded options, (ii) if the Fund is unable to maintain the proportional relationship based on the number of </span><span>exchange-traded options in the Fund’s portfolio, (iii) significant accrual of Fund expenses in connection with effecting the Fund’s principal </span><span>investment strategy or (iv) adverse tax law changes affecting the treatment of FLEX Options.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Investment in the Underlying Fund Risk.</span><span> Each Fund invests substantially all of its assets in</span><span> </span><span>the Underlying Fund, so each Fund’s </span><span>investment performance is related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. Each Fund may also invest in other funds, including money </span><span>market funds. Each Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which each Fund </span><span>invests based on their market valuations. An investment in a Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct </span><span>investment in the Underlying Fund. For example, in addition to the expenses of a Fund, a Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses </span><span>(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee </span><span>waiver by BFA.</span></div> <div> <div><span>An investor in a Fund may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from </span><span>transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of a Fund depends on the performance of individual securities or other assets to which the Fund has </span><span>exposure. The value of securities or other assets may decline, or perform differently from the market as a whole, due to changes in the </span><span>financial condition or credit rating of the issuer or counterparty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller-capitalization companies to adapt to </span><span>changing market conditions and competitive challenges. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller-capitalization companies. The performance of large-capitalization companies could trail the overall </span><span>performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders of a Fund, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party </span><span>investor, the Fund’s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time own or manage a </span><span>substantial amount of Fund shares or may hold their investment in the Fund for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares becoming concentrated in another party. There can be </span><span>no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that the size of a Fund would </span><span>be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares may adversely affect a Fund’s liquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund </span><span>permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the Fund to sell portfolio securities or other assets when it might not otherwise </span><span>do so, which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of Fund shares, increase the Fund’s brokerage </span><span>costs, accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains, and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders </span><span>earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as </span><span>receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. A Fund also may be required to sell its more </span><span>liquid investments to meet a large redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more volatile, and more difficult </span><span>to price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent these large shareholders transact in Fund shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for Fund shares and may, therefore, have a material upward or downward effect on the market price of the </span><span>shares. In addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in </span><span>investing new cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> An active Fund is subject to management risk because it does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified </span><span>index. BFA and the portfolio managers will utilize a proprietary investment process, techniques and risk analyses in making investment </span><span>decisions for a Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these decisions will produce the desired results. In addition, legislative, regulatory, </span><span>or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to BFA in connection with managing a Fund and may also adversely </span><span>affect the ability of a Fund to achieve its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> A Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more </span><span>prolonged market downturns. The value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general market conditions, </span><span>economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries or other geographic units, markets, industries, or asset classes. Local, regional or global events such as </span><span>war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or other </span><span>financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or </span><span>discounts to a Fund’s NAV. Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on all types of instruments </span><span>and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk. </span><span>A Fund faces numerous market trading risks, any of which may lead to its shares trading in the secondary market at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV or to the intraday value of the Fund’s portfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time when the market price </span><span>is at a premium to NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the market price is at a discount to the NAV, you may pay significantly more or </span><span>receive significantly less than the underlying value of the Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of an Active Primary Market.</span><span> Although Fund shares are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance </span><span>that an active primary trading market for Fund shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Listing Risks. </span><span>A Fund’s shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange </span><span>where the Fund’s primary listing is maintained. Fund shares also may be available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured </span><span>investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that a Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>exchange or in any market or that a Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for exchange listing or market trading. A Fund’s </span><span>shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and </span><span>market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information that is available to investors </span><span>who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other </span><span>markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of a Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to create </span><span>or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts to NAV than might </span><span>be experienced at times when the Fund accepts creation and redemption orders. Securities held by a Fund may be traded in markets that </span><span>close at a different time than an exchange on which Fund shares are traded. Liquidity in those securities may be reduced after the applicable </span><span>closing time. As a result, during the time when the exchange is open but after the applicable market closing, fixing or settlement time, there </span><span>may be wider bid/ask spreads on the exchange and a greater premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In stressed market conditions, the market for a Fund’s shares may become less liquid in response to deteriorating liquidity in the markets for </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio holdings, and an investor may be unable to sell their Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In times of </span><span>extraordinary market volatility, Fund shares may be subject to trading halts pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules of a stock exchange or market. </span><span>If there is a trading halt or unanticipated closure of an exchange or market, an investor may be unable to purchase or sell Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, if trading in certain securities or financial instruments is restricted, this may disrupt a Fund’s creation/redemption process, affect </span><span>the price at which Fund shares trade in the secondary market, and result in a Fund being unable to trade certain securities or financial </span><span>instruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may be unable to rebalance its portfolio or accurately price its portfolio holdings and may incur </span><span>substantial trading losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of </span><span>increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative products based on a Fund </span><span>may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund Shares May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV</span><span>. Shares of a Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most </span><span>recent NAV. A Fund’s NAV is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Fund’s </span><span>portfolio holdings. The trading price of a Fund’s shares fluctuates throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for </span><span>Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund’s portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of a Fund’s shares may deviate </span><span>significantly from NAV during times of market volatility, significant redemption requests, or other unusual market conditions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, because Fund shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to a </span><span>Fund’s NAV are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable </span><span>discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that a </span><span>Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to </span><span>correlate exactly with the Fund’s NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to </span><span>creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods </span><span>of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of a Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants </span><span>may be less willing to create or redeem a Fund’s shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or the Fund’s underlying </span><span>investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities </span><span>transactions. When buying or selling Fund shares through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> price). The spread varies over time for Fund shares based on </span><span>trading volume and market liquidity. It is generally narrower if a Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if a Fund has </span><span>less trading volume and market liquidity. Increased market volatility also may cause wider spreads. In addition, there may be regulatory and </span><span>other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading </span><span>may detract significantly from investment results, and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate </span><span>regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-Diversification Risk.</span><span> A Fund that is classified as </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified</span><span>”</span><span> may invest a greater percentage of its assets in securities or other </span><span>instruments representing a small number of issuers or counterparties, compared with funds that are classified as </span><span>“</span><span>diversified.</span><span>”</span><span> A non-diversified</span><span> Fund thus may be more susceptible to the risks associated with these particular issuers or counterparties. The gains and losses </span><span>on such holdings may have a greater impact on a non-diversified Fund’s performance than they would on the performance of a diversified </span><span>Fund, and a non-diversified Fund’s NAV may be more volatile.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> Each Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, </span><span>processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate </span><span>processes and technology or systems failures. Each Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. </span><span>However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Options Risk. </span><span>Investments in options are considered speculative. When the Fund purchases an option, it may lose the total premium paid for </span><span>it if the price of the underlying security or other assets decreased, remained the same or failed to increase to a level at or beyond the </span><span>exercise price (in the case of a call option) or increased, remained the same or failed to decrease to a level at or below the exercise price (in </span><span>the case of a put option). If a put or call option purchased by the Fund were permitted to expire without being sold or exercised, its premium </span><span>would represent a loss to the Fund. To the extent that the Fund writes or sells an option, if the decline or increase in the underlying asset is </span><span>significantly below or above the exercise price of the written option, the Fund could experience a substantial loss.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers will subject a Fund or the Underlying Fund to </span><span>regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more </span><span>services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed </span><span>countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some </span><span>geographic areas in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial </span><span>disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial </span><span>markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. </span><span>Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily </span><span>indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting </span><span>the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> Investing in U.S. issuers involves legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks that are </span><span>specific to the U.S. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations, inflation, an economic recession, financial system stress, </span><span>or political turmoil, among other risks, may have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The U.S. </span><span>is also subject to the risk of natural disasters, such as droughts, earthquakes, fires and floods. U.S. security risks include acts of terrorism, </span><span>internal unrest and a deterioration in relations between the U.S. and certain countries. Any of these may adversely affect the U.S. economy, </span><span>financial markets or issuers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, the costs of servicing such debt may constrain future economic growth. </span><span>Circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the </span><span>legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose money because </span><span>the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could also lose money in the event of a </span><span>decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These </span><span>events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), which is the securities </span><span>lending agent for the iShares/BlackRock ETFs, will take into account the tax impact to Fund shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When a Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund </span><span>may face the risk of being delisted if it does not meet certain requirements set by the listing exchange. If a Fund were required to delist from </span><span>the listing exchange, the Fund’s value may rapidly decline and its performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation of the </span><span>Fund could lead to elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Risk. </span><span>The Fund intends to elect and to qualify each year to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As a </span><span>RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its net investment income and net capital gain that it distributes </span><span>to shareholders, provided that it satisfies certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the federal income tax treatment of </span><span>certain aspects of the proposed operations of the Fund are not entirely clear. This includes the tax aspects of the Fund’s options strategy, its </span><span>hedging strategy, the possible application of the </span><span>“</span><span>straddle</span><span>”</span><span> rules, and various loss limitation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To </span><span>qualify and maintain its status as a RIC, the Fund must meet certain income, diversification and distributions tests. For purposes of the </span><span>diversification test, the identification of the issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a particular Fund investment can depend on the terms and </span><span>conditions of that investment. There is no published Internal Revenue Service (the </span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) guidance or case law on how to determine the </span><span>“</span><span>issuer</span><span>”</span><span> of certain derivatives that the Fund will enter into. Therefore, there is a risk that the Fund will not meet the Internal Revenue Code’s </span><span>diversification requirements and will not qualify, or will be disqualified, as a RIC. The Fund intends to treat the issuer of the FLEX Options as </span><span>the referenced asset, which, assuming the referenced asset qualifies as a RIC, would allow the Fund to count the FLEX Options as </span><span>automatically diversified investments under the Internal Revenue Code’s diversification requirements. In addition, the Fund intends to treat </span><span>any income it may derive from the FLEX Options as </span><span>“</span><span>qualifying income</span><span>”</span><span> under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to RICs. </span><span>If the income is not qualifying income or if the FLEX Options are not treated as issued by the reference asset for diversification test purposes, </span><span>there is a risk that the Fund could lose its RIC status. If the Fund did not qualify as a RIC for any taxable year and certain relief provisions </span><span>were not available, the Fund’s taxable income would be subject to tax at the Fund level and to a further tax at the shareholder level when </span><span>such income is distributed. In such event, in order to re-qualify for taxation as a RIC, the Fund might be required to recognize unrealized </span><span>gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make certain distributions. This would cause investors to incur higher tax liabilities than they </span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>otherwise would have incurred and would have a negative impact on Fund returns. In such event, the Fund may reorganize, close or </span><span>materially change its investment objective and strategies.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund’s investments in offsetting positions with respect to the Underlying ETF may affect the character of gains or losses realized by the </span><span>Fund under the Internal Revenue Code’s </span><span>“</span><span>straddle</span><span>”</span><span> rules and may increase the amount of short-term capital gain realized by the Fund. Such </span><span>short-term capital gain is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to U.S. shareholders in a non-liquidating distribution. As a result, if the </span><span>Fund makes a non-liquidating distribution of its short-term capital gain, the amount which U.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary income </span><span>may be increased substantially as compared to the Fund that did not engage in such transactions. Accordingly, shareholders could have a </span><span>lower after-tax return from investing in the Fund than investing directly in the Underlying ETF.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FLEX Options included in the Fund’s portfolio are exchange-traded options. The tax treatment of certain derivatives contracts including </span><span>listed non-equity options written or purchased by the Fund on U.S. exchanges (such as options on futures contracts, broad-based equity </span><span>indices and debt securities) may be governed by Section 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 1256 Contracts</span><span>”</span><span>). Section 1256 </span><span>Contracts are treated as if they were sold (i.e., </span><span>“</span><span>marked to market</span><span>”</span><span>) at the end of each year. Gain or loss is recognized on this deemed sale. </span><span>Such treatment could cause the Fund to recognize taxable income without receiving cash. In order to maintain its RIC qualification, the Fund </span><span>must distribute at least 90% of its income annually. If FLEX Options held by the Fund are subject to Section 1256 of the Internal Revenue </span><span>Code, and the Fund is unable to distribute marked-to-market gains to its shareholders, the Fund may lose its RIC qualification and be taxed </span><span>as a regular corporation. BFA believes that the FLEX Options typically held in its portfolio (i.e., FLEX Options that reference the iShares Core </span><span>S&amp;P 500 ETF) will not be subject to Section 1256, and disposition of such options will likely result in short-term capital gains or losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, buying securities shortly before the record date for a taxable dividend or capital gain distribution is commonly known as </span><span>“</span><span>buying </span><span>a dividend.</span><span>”</span><span> If a shareholder purchases Fund shares after the Hedge Period has begun and shortly thereafter the Fund issues a dividend, the </span><span>entire distribution may be taxable to the shareholder even though a portion of the distribution effectively represents a return of the purchase </span><span>price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Technology Companies Risk.</span><span> Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances may have limited product </span><span>lines, markets, financial resources and personnel. These companies may face rapid product obsolescence as well as unexpected risks and </span><span>costs related to new product introduction and technological developments, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Technology </span><span>companies may be adversely affected by disruptions to supply chains and distribution networks as well as issues at third-party partners. They </span><span>are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property rights, and the loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect their </span><span>profitability. Technology companies may face increased government scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or legal action. </span><span>These companies also may be adversely affected by, among other things, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities or other defects in their </span><span>products and services, which may result in lawsuits, government enforcement actions and other remediation costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Upside Participation Risk. </span><span>There can be no guarantee that the Fund will be successful in its strategy to match the increase, if any, of the </span><span>share price return of the Underlying ETF over a Hedge Period, subject to an Approximate Cap. In the event an investor purchases Fund shares </span><span>after the beginning of a Hedge Period or does not stay invested in a Fund for the entirety of the Hedge Period, the returns realized by the </span><span>investor may not match those that the Fund seeks to achieve.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price that a Fund could receive upon the sale (or other disposition) of a security or other asset may differ from the </span><span>Fund’s valuation of the security or other asset, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that </span><span>are valued using a fair value methodology. Because non-U.S. exchanges or markets may be open on days or during time periods when a Fund </span><span>does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other assets in a Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when </span><span>investors are not able to purchase or sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participants that create or redeem Fund shares on days when a Fund is holding fair-valued securities or other assets may receive </span><span>fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the securities or other assets not been fair </span><span>valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by </span><span>pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part </span><span>of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in </span><span>agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund from closing out </span><span>a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit a Fund </span><span>from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase </span><span>credit risk and other risks to a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Communication Services Sector Risk.</span><span> The communication services sector consists of both companies in the telecommunication services </span><span>industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication services industry group </span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment </span><span>industry group encompass a variety of services and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking </span><span>platforms, online classifieds, online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be </span><span>affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications products </span><span>and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting demographics and often </span><span>unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services company's profitability. In addition, while all </span><span>companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the communication services sector may be particular </span><span>targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse </span><span>effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with </span><span>governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may </span><span>negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing </span><span>clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The communications services industry can also be significantly </span><span>affected by intense competition for market share, including competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, </span><span>product compatibility and standardization, consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, </span><span>lack of standardization or compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the </span><span>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing </span><span>competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products </span><span>and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in </span><span>a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain </span><span>participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to </span><span>consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future. </span><span>Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to </span><span>competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. </span><span>markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in </span><span>formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary </span><span>income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in government regulation. Companies in </span><span>the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media </span><span>and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and </span><span>entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of </span><span>domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, consumer confidence, changes in </span><span>demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income </span><span>and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product </span><span>components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. </span><span>Tobacco and tobacco-related companies, in particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the </span><span>consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by </span><span>unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and </span><span>underperform other types of stocks or the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or continue </span><span>paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of dividend-paying stocks will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or </span><span>eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or increases in the payment of dividends), </span><span>which may adversely affect a Fund with such holdings. In addition, the value of dividend-paying stocks can decline when interest rates rise, </span><span>as fixed-income investments become more attractive to investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they must maintain and, </span><span>potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by financial companies may also result in greater </span><span>overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various </span><span>countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, </span><span>including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through </span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>swaps and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to </span><span>companies with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the </span><span>availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related </span><span>markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse </span><span>impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target </span><span>for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused </span><span>significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact a Fund. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company </span><span>that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among </span><span>others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products </span><span>and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are </span><span>heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many </span><span>healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to </span><span>competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of </span><span>2022 allows for the negotiation of prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced prescription prices. </span><span>This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory </span><span>approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in </span><span>the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of legislative </span><span>proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be </span><span>enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>A Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, a Fund would have invested </span><span>more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be </span><span>sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by a Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by a </span><span>Fund, and any security or instrument held by a Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to a Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent a Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of a Fund because a Fund may be </span><span>unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and </span><span>capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or insolvency of local governments. To the extent that a Fund </span><span>invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, a Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks </span><span>associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although each Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of a Fund on an in-kind basis, if a Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under </span><span>unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, a Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising </span><span>interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from a Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as a Fund, causing increased supply of a Fund’s underlying investments in the </span><span>market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, a Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of a Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for </span><span>a Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by a Fund, which could lead </span><span>to a Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and </span><span>demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing </span><span>companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade </span><span>disputes and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of </span><span>companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and </span><span>product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be </span><span>influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be </span><span>adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government </span><span>demand for their products and services.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Advisor Risk. </span><span>The Fund is dependent upon services and resources provided by BFA, and therefore BFA’s parent, BlackRock, Inc. </span><span>BFA is not required to devote its full time to the business of the Fund and there is no guarantee or requirement that any investment </span><span>professional or other employee of BFA will allocate a substantial portion of his or her time to the Fund. The loss of, or changes in, BFA’s </span><span>personnel could have a negative effect on the performance or the continued operation of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions </span><span>undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and </span><span>its affiliates on behalf of clients (including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, exercise rights or undertake business transactions </span><span>may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of a Fund to invest in certain securities or other assets may be affected </span><span>by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>holdings. To the extent a Fund tracks an index, such limits may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested in an asset relative to its </span><span>Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div> <div><span>For example, ownership limits may apply to securities whose issuers operate in certain regulated industries or in certain international </span><span>markets. Such limits also may apply where the investing entity (such as a Fund) is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions </span><span>or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions. In certain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-level amounts invested or </span><span>voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including a Fund) may not exceed the relevant limits </span><span>without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent. In other cases, exceeding such thresholds may cause BFA and its </span><span>affiliates, a Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of each Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Funds' </span><span>combined SAI.

BFA </span><span>provides an investment program for each Fund and manages the investment of each Fund’s assets. In managing the Funds, BFA may draw </span><span>upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve a Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach </span><span>brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Funds), BFA is responsible for </span><span>substantially all expenses of the Funds, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the </span><span>acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution </span><span>fees or expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust). Operating expenses paid by BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired Fund Fees </span><span>and Expenses, if any.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to each Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund, as a percentage of each Fund’s average </span><span>daily net assets, at the annual rate set forth in the table below. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating </span><span>expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any).

BFA and its Affiliates </span><span>provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar </span><span>to that of the Funds. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict </span><span>with those of the Funds. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity </span><span>pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have </span><span>other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Funds may directly </span><span>or indirectly invests. The Funds may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Funds may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for </span><span>which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The </span><span>Funds also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or </span><span>to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Funds or who engage in transactions with or for the Funds, and may receive </span><span>compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have </span><span>investment objectives similar to those of the Funds and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, </span><span>currencies and other instruments as the Funds. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end </span><span>investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Funds and BFA, to the extent permitted under </span><span>the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without </span><span>reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Funds and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that </span><span>are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Funds. As a result, </span><span>an Affiliate may compete with the Funds for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Funds' investment activities, therefore, </span><span>may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Funds could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other </span><span>accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Funds may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees </span><span>or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its Affiliates may </span><span>adversely impact the Funds. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have </span><span>the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Funds.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>The Funds' activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal </span><span>policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, each Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending </span><span>agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent </span><span>will receive a fee from the Fund based on the returns earned on the Fund’s lending activities, including investment of the cash received as </span><span>collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio </span><span>securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds have retained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to </span><span>perform certain order processing, Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from </span><span>Authorized Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank may have, or </span><span>from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) </span><span>may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Funds. The price, availability, liquidity, and (in some cases) </span><span>expense ratio of the Funds may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Funds by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that </span><span>could disadvantage the Funds and their shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts </span><span>of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Funds, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares</span><span> (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Funds may be acquired or redeemed directly from a Fund only in Creation Units or multiples </span><span>thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or </span><span>redemption transactions directly with a Fund. Once created, shares of the Funds generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less </span><span>than a Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold </span><span>throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of </span><span>a Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Funds' shares trade under the ticker symbols listed on the front </span><span>cover page of this Prospectus.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities </span><span>transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Funds through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The </span><span>commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of </span><span>shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies </span><span>over time for shares of each Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are </span><span>newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the </span><span>Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board </span><span>determined not to adopt policies and procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares </span><span>because each Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for </span><span>placing cash-related transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities. However, each Fund has </span><span>taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential consequences of frequent cash purchases and </span><span>redemptions by Authorized Participants, such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the Fund, and/or </span><span>increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve </span><span>each Fund directly, and such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund </span><span>shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which each Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on </span><span>weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, </span><span>Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Each Fund’s primary listing </span><span>exchange is Cboe BZX.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment </span><span>companies, in the securities of other investment companies.  For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as </span><span>the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition: (i) more than </span><span>3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by </span><span>the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other </span><span>investment companies and companies controlled by them. Although SEC rules may permit registered investment companies and unit </span><span>investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>Investing Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) that enter into an investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set </span><span>forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, </span><span>Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund. In addition, foreign </span><span>investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC </span><span>no-action relief.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Funds are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust </span><span>Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of each Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Funds are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities </span><span>depository for shares of the Funds. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations </span><span>and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not </span><span>entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered </span><span>owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These </span><span>procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of a Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by </span><span>market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the Funds, economic conditions </span><span>and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of each Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the </span><span>close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is </span><span>open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the </span><span>U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service </span><span>providers. The NAV of each Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets, which </span><span>includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of </span><span>the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by each Fund is determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and </span><span>procedures. BFA has been designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally </span><span>determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or </span><span>market on which the security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money </span><span>market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most </span><span>recent closing price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the </span><span>close of regular trading hours of the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Funds are determined as of such </span><span>times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund’s investments in </span><span>accordance with its policies and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or </span><span>other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from </span><span>recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when </span><span>there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is </span><span>suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in </span><span>its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material </span><span>change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by a Fund is the </span><span>amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length</span><span> transaction. Valuing a Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations </span><span>and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were </span><span>used.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by each Fund. Each Fund </span><span>generally distributes its net capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are </span><span>declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for each Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a RIC or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of each Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend </span><span>payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received from a </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry</span><span> Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of a Fund for reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners </span><span>should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require </span><span>beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income </span><span>and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of a Fund purchased in the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in </span><span>the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. </span><span>Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of the Funds will be taxed. The tax information in this </span><span>Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax </span><span>consequences of an investment in shares of the Funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which </span><span>case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when a Fund makes </span><span>distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from a Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of </span><span>income from securities lending and distributions out of a Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to </span><span>you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held a Fund’s shares. Distributions by a Fund that qualify as qualified </span><span>dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally </span><span>eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not </span><span>limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) </span><span>and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by a Fund. Generally, qualified </span><span>dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that a Fund satisfies </span><span>certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by a Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this </span><span>purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax </span><span>treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily </span><span>tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends received by a Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out </span><span>of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. The Funds do not expect that a significant portion of their distributions will consist of </span><span>qualified dividend income or be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by a Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years </span><span>beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being </span><span>hedged by a Fund, and with respect to a share of a Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning </span><span>at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, </span><span>however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Short term capital gains earned by an Underlying Fund will be ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the </span><span>Fund's capital losses. Because each Fund is expected to invest in its respective Underlying Funds, each Fund’s realized losses on sales of </span><span>shares of an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales</span><span>”</span><span>. Capital loss carryforwards of an Underlying Fund, </span><span>if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If a Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year </span><span>may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not </span><span>in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of </span><span>capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital </span><span>loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further </span><span>distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of a Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by an Underlying Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to </span><span>withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate </span><span>such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of an Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities </span><span>(generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>) (and 50% of the </span><span>total assets of a Fund at the close of the year consists of foreign securities, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of Underlying Funds), a </span><span>Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or an Underlying Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of each Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source </span><span>income, thereby limiting a U.S. person’s ability to use such credits. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. corporation (other than a pass-through entity to the extent </span><span>owned by U.S. persons), a Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be </span><span>subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or </span><span>income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of </span><span>shares of a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial </span><span>institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and </span><span>indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect </span><span>U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, </span><span>comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to </span><span>U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the </span><span>event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with </span><span>similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while </span><span>the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed </span><span>through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have </span><span>not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain </span><span>or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one year or </span><span>less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as </span><span>long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from </span><span>sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare </span><span>contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Treatment of the FLEX Options.</span><span> A Fund’s investments in offsetting positions with respect to the Underlying ETF may be </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> for U.S. </span><span>federal income tax purposes. The straddle rules may affect the character of gains (or losses) realized by a Fund, and losses realized by a Fund </span><span>on positions that are part of a straddle may be deferred under the straddle rules, rather than being taken into account in calculating taxable </span><span>income for the taxable year in which the losses are realized. In addition, certain carrying charges (including interest expense) associated with </span><span>positions in a straddle may be required to be capitalized rather than deducted currently. Certain elections that a Fund may make with respect </span><span>to its straddle positions may also affect the amount, character and timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the affected positions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The tax consequences of straddle transactions to a Fund are not entirely clear in all situations under currently available authority. The </span><span>straddle rules may increase the amount of short-term capital gain realized by a Fund, which is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to </span><span>U.S. shareholders in a non-liquidating distribution. Because application of the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses, defer </span><span>losses and/or accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions, if a Fund makes a non-liquidating </span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>distribution of its short-term capital gain, the amount which U.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary income may be increased or decreased </span><span>substantially as compared to a Fund that did not engage in such transactions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The FLEX Options included in the portfolio are exchange-traded options. Under Section 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain types of </span><span>exchange-traded options are treated as if they were sold (i.e., </span><span>“</span><span>marked to market</span><span>”</span><span>) at the end of each year. The Funds do not believe that the </span><span>positions held by the Funds will be subject to Section 1256, which means that the positions will not be marked to market, but the positions </span><span>will be subject to the straddle rules.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in a Fund. It is not a </span><span>substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your </span><span>personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of a Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Funds are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large </span><span>investors and institutions only in block size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant (an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized </span><span>Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Funds’ Distributor. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing </span><span>agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with each Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or </span><span>participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and a Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant </span><span>deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and an amount of cash (including </span><span>any cash representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the </span><span>Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any </span><span>portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). Each Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by </span><span>a Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may differ and a Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is </span><span>contained in the Funds’ SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is </span><span>received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with a Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation </span><span>Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or </span><span>redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to a Fund’s instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be </span><span>able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent a Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities </span><span>for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit </span><span>and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 </span><span>Act. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, </span><span>will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National </span><span>Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and </span><span>redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including </span><span>the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Funds’ SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of a Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is </span><span>used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on </span><span>the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into </span><span>account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary </span><span>secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the </span><span>1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery </span><span>of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to </span><span>transactions on a national securities exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference </span><span>of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same address, </span><span>even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding </span><span>and wish to change your householding status.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for each Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary </span><span>market in shares of the Funds. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of any Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold </span><span>by any Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of </span><span>technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Funds and certain other iShares funds </span><span>available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are </span><span>not made by the Funds. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in </span><span>part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial </span><span>intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its </span><span>customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives </span><span>offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary </span><span>to recommend the Funds or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the </span><span>Funds' SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments </span><span>his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial highlights for the Funds are not available because, as of the effective date of this Prospectus, the Funds have not commenced </span><span>operations and therefore have no financial highlights to report.</span></div> </div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span> </span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span> </span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Want to know more?</span></div> <div> <div><span>iShares.com  | 1-800-474-2737 (1-800-iShares)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Information on the Funds' net asset value, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads can be found at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.

Shares of each Fund are listed for trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>), a national securities exchange. Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at </span><span>market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund’s NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units, and, generally, in </span><span>exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the Redemption of Creation Units section of this SAI). </span><span>Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally 40,000 or multiples thereof.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash </span><span>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash.

The Trust may use </span><span>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation and Redemption of Creation Units section of this </span><span>SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher </span><span>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with </span><span>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and </span><span>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the Prospectus.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary </span><span>markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the </span><span>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The </span><span>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </span><span>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or </span><span>beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </span><span>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall </span><span>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </span><span>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks of the Funds</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Mar ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund seeks to provide exposure to the share price return of the Underlying ETF up to an approximate upside limit (the </span><span>“</span><span>Approximate Cap</span><span>”</span><span>), while seeking to maximize the downside protection against Underlying ETF losses (the </span><span>“</span><span>Approximate </span><span>Buffer</span><span>”</span><span>) over each annual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% </span><span>of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities or other instruments that provide exposure to </span><span>securities of large capitalization companies or that provide for the upside limit on gains or the downside protection against </span><span>the losses of securities of large capitalization companies. For purposes of the Fund’s 80% policy, </span><span>“</span><span>large capitalization </span><span>companies</span><span>”</span><span> are those within the range of capitalization of the Underlying ETF’s underlying index.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund principally buys shares of the Underlying ETF and customized put options thereon and sells call options that </span><span>reference the Underlying ETF.

This is because while the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for </span><span>the Hedge Period are fixed levels that are calculated in relation to the Underlying ETF price and the Fund’s NAV at the start of </span><span>each Hedge Period and generally remain constant throughout the Hedge Period, an investor purchasing Fund shares at </span><span>market price during the Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares at a price that is different from the Fund’s NAV at the start </span><span>of the Hedge Period (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the NAV that the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer reference). For example, if an investor </span><span>purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has increased from its price at </span><span>the beginning of the Hedge Period, the investor’s upside limit may be lower than the Approximate Cap and the investor may </span><span>experience losses prior to reaching the downside protection offered by the Approximate Buffer. Conversely, if an investor </span><span>purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has decreased from its price </span><span>at the beginning of the Hedge Period, the Fund may require a larger increase in the Underlying ETF’s share price before it </span><span>reaches the Approximate Cap.

This is because while the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for </span><span>the Hedge Period are fixed levels that are calculated in relation to the Underlying ETF price and the Fund’s NAV at the start of </span><span>each Hedge Period and generally remain constant throughout the Hedge Period, an investor purchasing Fund shares at </span><span>market price during the Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares at a price that is different from the Fund’s NAV at the start </span><span>of the Hedge Period (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the NAV that the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer reference).

Conversely, if an investor </span><span>purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has decreased from its price </span><span>at the beginning of the Hedge Period, the Fund may require a larger increase in the Underlying ETF’s share price before it </span><span>reaches the Approximate Cap.

This is because while the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for </span><span>the Hedge Period are fixed levels that are calculated in relation to the Underlying ETF price and the Fund’s NAV at the start of </span><span>each Hedge Period and generally remain constant throughout the Hedge Period, an investor purchasing Fund shares at </span><span>market price during the Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares at a price that is different from the Fund’s NAV at the start </span><span>of the Hedge Period (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the NAV that the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer reference). For example, if an investor </span><span>purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has increased from its price at </span><span>the beginning of the Hedge Period, the investor’s upside limit may be lower than the Approximate Cap and the investor may </span><span>experience losses prior to reaching the downside protection offered by the Approximate Buffer. Conversely, if an investor </span><span>purchases Fund shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s share price has decreased from its price </span><span>at the beginning of the Hedge Period, the Fund may require a larger increase in the Underlying ETF’s share price before it </span><span>reaches the Approximate Cap. The Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer, and the Fund’s position relative to each, which </span><span>are typically available on iShares.com daily, should be considered before investing in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return may be subject to an upside limit significantly below the </span><span>Approximate Cap and downside protection significantly lower than the Approximate Buffer. An investor may lose their entire </span><span>investment and an investment in the Fund is only appropriate for investors willing to bear those losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Following the close of business on the last day of each Hedge Period, the Fund will file a prospectus supplement that </span><span>discloses the Fund’s Approximate Cap (gross and net of the unitary management fee) for the next Hedge Period. The Fund’s </span><span>Approximate Cap (net of the unitary management fee) for the current Hedge Period, along with Fund’s position relative to </span><span>the Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap, will be available on the Fund’s website, </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additional Information Regarding FLEX Options.</span><span>  </span><span>FLEX Options are customized option contracts available through national </span><span>securities exchanges that are guaranteed for settlement by the OCC. FLEX Options are listed on a U.S. national securities </span><span>exchange. FLEX Options provide investors with the ability to customize assets referenced by the options, exercise prices, </span><span>exercise styles (i.e., American- style, exercisable any time prior to the expiration date, or European-style, exercisable only on </span><span>the option expiration date) and expiration dates, while achieving price discovery in competitive, transparent auctions markets </span><span>and avoiding the counterparty exposure of over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) options positions. Each option contract entitles the </span><span>holder thereof to purchase (for the call options) or sell (for the put options) shares of the reference asset at the strike price. </span><span>Each Fund’s portfolio includes several types of FLEX Options, including both purchased and written put and call options (as </span><span>further described below). The FLEX Options are all European style options, which means that they are exercisable at a </span><span>predetermined specified price (the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price</span><span>”</span><span>) only on the FLEX Option’s expiration date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The OCC guarantees performance by each of the counterparties to the FLEX Options, becoming the </span><span>“</span><span>buyer for every seller </span><span>and the seller for every buyer</span><span>”</span><span>, reducing counterparty risk for clearing members and options traders. Although guaranteed </span><span>for settlement by the OCC, FLEX Options are still subject to counterparty risk with the OCC and subject to the risk that the </span><span>OCC may fail to perform the settlement of the FLEX Options due to bankruptcy or other adverse reasons. Each Fund bears </span><span>the risk that the OCC will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the FLEX Options contracts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to determination by the Securities Committee of the OCC, adjustments may be made to the FLEX Options for certain </span><span>events (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Corporate Actions</span><span>”</span><span>) specified in the OCC’s by-laws and rules: certain stock dividends or distributions, </span><span>stock splits, reverse stock splits, rights offerings, distributions, reorganizations, recapitalizations, or reclassifications with </span><span>respect to an underlying security, or a merger, consolidation, dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of the underlying security. </span><span>According to the OCC’s by-laws, the nature and extent of any such adjustment is to be determined by the OCC’s Securities </span><span>Committee, in light of the circumstances known to it at the time such determination is made, based on its judgment as to </span><span>what is appropriate for the protection of investors and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to </span><span>holders and writers (or purchasers and sellers) of the affected options, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The FLEX Options in which each Fund invests will be options on an ETF or the S&amp;P </span><span>500 Index (together with such ETF, a </span><span>“</span><span>Reference Asset</span><span>”</span><span>) or the S&amp;P 500 Index. As such, the value of a Fund’s FLEX Options </span><span>will fluctuate with changes in the value of the securities held by the ETF, and thus the ETF’s share price. In addition to the </span><span>value of the ETF, the value of an option, in general, will reflect, among other things, the time remaining until expiration (the </span><span>end of the Outcome Period), the relationship of the exercise price to the market price of the Reference Asset, and general </span><span>market conditions. Options that expire unexercised have no value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each of the options exchanges has established limitations governing the maximum number of call or put options on the </span><span>same asset that may be bought or written by a single investor, whether acting alone or in concert with others (regardless of </span><span>whether such options are written on the same or different exchanges or are held or written on one or more accounts or </span><span>through one or more brokers). Under these limitations, option positions of all investment companies advised by BFA are </span><span>combined for purposes of these limits. Pursuant to these limitations, an exchange may order the liquidation of positions and </span><span>may impose other sanctions or restrictions. These position limits may restrict the number of listed options that a Fund may </span><span>buy or sell. Currently, the relevant national securities exchanges have no position limits for the instruments in which the </span><span>Funds expect to invest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The puts and calls on the Reference Asset entitle the purchaser of the option the right to purchase (for a call option) or sell </span><span>(for a put option) the Reference Asset at a predetermined specified price (the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price</span><span>”</span><span>). When a Fund writes a call on the </span><span>Reference Asset, it receives a premium and agrees that the purchaser of the call, upon exercise of the call, will receive from </span><span>the Fund the delivery of a specified number of shares of the ETF in exchange for the strike price. When a Fund buys a call on </span><span>the Reference Asset, it pays a premium and has the same rights to such call as indicated above. When a Fund buys a put on </span><span>the Reference Asset, it pays a premium and has the right to require the seller of the put, upon the Fund’s exercise of the put, </span><span>to deliver the specified number of shares of the ETF in exchange for the strike price. When a Fund writes a put on the </span><span>Reference Asset, it receives a premium and the purchaser of the put has the right to require the Fund to deliver the specified </span><span>number of shares of the ETF in exchange for the strike price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although each Fund will generally utilize FLEX Options that are physically settled, a Fund may also utilize FLEX Options that </span><span>are cash-settled. Cash-settled options give the holder the right to receive an amount (or owe an amount) of cash upon the </span><span>exercise of the option. Gain or loss depends on changes in the value of the ETF’s share price relative to the strike price for a </span><span>given option contract. The amount of cash is equal to the difference between the closing price of the ETF’s share price and </span><span>the exercise price of the option contract times a specified multiple (</span><span>“</span><span>multiplier</span><span>”</span><span>), which determines the total value for each </span><span>point of such difference.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risks of Options on the Reference Assets.</span><span> </span><span>If a Fund has purchased an option and exercises it before the closing value for that </span><span>day is available, it runs the risk that the level of the Reference Asset may subsequently change. If such a change causes the </span><span>exercised option to fall out of the money, the applicable Fund will be required to pay the difference between the closing </span><span>Reference Asset value and the exercise price of the option (times the applicable multiplier) to the assigned writer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The securities </span><span>of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant percentage of a fund’s </span><span>investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility </span><span>than that experienced by more diversified investment companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a </span><span>regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal </span><span>Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are </span><span>distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the </span><span>diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it </span><span>less likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed-income securities. The market price of </span><span>equity securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities may decline in value due to </span><span>factors affecting equity securities markets generally; particular industries, sectors or geographic regions represented in those </span><span>markets; or individual issuers. The types of developments that may affect an issuer of an equity security include management </span><span>performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services. Common and preferred stock </span><span>represent equity or ownership interests in an issuer. Preferred stock, however, pays dividends at a specified rate and has </span><span>precedence over common stock in the payment of dividends. In the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy, the </span><span>claims of owners of bonds and preferred stock take precedence over the claims of those who own common stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by a Fund and the Underlying Fund to access its investable universe, simulate investments that would otherwise be </span><span>eligible, facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund or the Underlying Fund may enter into futures contracts </span><span>and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund or the Underlying Fund will not use </span><span>futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund and the Underlying Fund intend to use </span><span>futures and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to the Underlying Fund, has claimed an </span><span>exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to </span><span>such Funds or the Underlying Fund, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. </span><span>See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of this SAI for more information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund or the Underlying Fund may </span><span>enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and </span><span>believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is </span><span>similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund or the Underlying Fund upon </span><span>termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the futures </span><span>contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund or the Underlying Fund may elect to </span><span>close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund or the Underlying Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call </span><span>options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also </span><span>known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> less the premium received from writing the put. The Funds or the Underlying Fund may purchase </span><span>and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of </span><span>their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect </span><span>to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to or dispose of securities that are otherwise eligible investments </span><span>at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that being sought by the Fund or </span><span>otherwise to achieve the Fund's objective.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified </span><span>price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder the right to sell a specific security at an </span><span>exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is </span><span>paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such option is exercised. Each Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities </span><span>held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed to purchase. Each </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to </span><span>hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund may purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market </span><span>through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the </span><span>appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or </span><span>physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable </span><span>only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in </span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investments in Underlying Funds. </span><span> </span><span>Each Underlying Fund is a type of investment company referred to as an exchange-traded </span><span>fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF</span><span>”</span><span>). Each Underlying Fund is designed to track a particular index and is advised by BFA. Shares of the Underlying </span><span>Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges and trade throughout the day on those exchanges and other </span><span>secondary markets. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the national securities exchanges necessary to </span><span>maintain the listing of shares of the Underlying Funds will continue to be met. A national securities exchange may, but is not </span><span>required to, remove the shares of the Underlying Funds from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month </span><span>period beginning upon the commencement of trading of an Underlying Fund, there are fewer than 50 record and/or </span><span>beneficial holders of the shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of an Underlying Fund's underlying </span><span>index is no longer calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition exist that, in the opinion of the </span><span>national securities exchange, makes further dealings on the national securities exchange inadvisable. A national securities </span><span>exchange will remove the shares of an Underlying Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Underlying Fund. </span><span>Shares of each Underlying Fund trade on exchanges at prices at, above or below their most recent NAV. The per share NAV of </span><span>each Underlying Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of such </span><span>Underlying Fund's holdings since the most recent calculation. The trading prices of an Underlying Fund's shares fluctuate </span><span>continuously throughout trading hours based on market supply and demand rather than NAV. The trading prices of an </span><span>Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. Any of these factors may </span><span>lead to an Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span><span>exactly with an Underlying Fund's NAV due to timing reasons as well as market supply and demand factors. In addition, </span><span>disruptions to an Underlying Fund's creations and redemptions or the existence of extreme market volatility may result in </span><span>trading prices of Underlying Fund shares that differ significantly from NAV. If the Funds purchase shares of the Underlying </span><span>Funds at a time when the market price of the Underlying Fund's shares are at a premium to the NAV or sells at a time when </span><span>the market price of the Underlying Fund is at a discount to the NAV, then the Funds may sustain losses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, brokers' commissions on buying or selling shares of the Underlying Funds </span><span>will be based on negotiated commission rates at customary levels. An investment in an ETF generally presents the same </span><span>primary risks as an investment in an open-end investment company that is not exchange-traded and that has the same </span><span>investment objectives, strategies, and policies. However, ETFs are subject to the following risks that do not apply to an open-end</span><span> investment company that is not exchange-traded: (i) the market price of the ETF's shares may trade at a discount to their </span><span>net asset value; (ii) an active trading market for an ETF's shares may not develop or be maintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in </span><span>an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a </span><span>Fund or Underlying Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund or Underlying Fund </span><span>exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund’s or Underlying Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral </span><span>received). A Fund or Underlying Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each </span><span>Fund or Underlying Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions </span><span>paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund or Underlying Fund is </span><span>compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash </span><span>collateral received by the Fund or Underlying Fund for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term</span><span> instruments either directly on behalf of each Fund or Underlying Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money </span><span>market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk. Other investment </span><span>companies in which a Fund or the Underlying Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such </span><span>as investment advisory and administration fees, that would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund and Underlying Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to </span><span>lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund or Underlying Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund or Underlying Fund engages in securities </span><span>lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA.

If a Fund were to lend out securities that are subject to a corporate </span><span>action and commit to the borrower a particular election as determined by the Funds' investment adviser, the benefit the Fund </span><span>would receive in respect of committing to such election may or may not be less than the benefit the Fund would have </span><span>received from making a different election in such corporate action. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund </span><span>or Underlying Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned </span><span>securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s or Underlying </span><span>Fund's securities as agreed, the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span><span>impacted, or the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do </span><span>not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in </span><span>purchasing replacement securities.

Under the 1940 Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) </span><span>3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to </span><span>any one investment company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. </span><span>Other investment companies in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses </span><span>for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used </span><span>for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which </span><span>reflect a Fund's </span><span>pro rata </span><span>share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies</span><span> </span><span>(as disclosed in </span><span>the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund or the Underlying Fund may purchase ETF shares for the same reason it would purchase (and as an alternative to </span><span>purchasing) futures contracts – to obtain relatively low-cost exposure to the stock market while maintaining flexibility to </span><span>meet the liquidity needs of the Underlying Fund. ETF shares enjoy several advantages over futures contracts. Depending on </span><span>the market, the holding period, and other factors, ETF shares can be less costly than futures contracts. In addition, ETF shares </span><span>can be purchased for smaller sums and offer exposure to market sectors and styles for which there is no suitable or liquid </span><span>futures contract. The Underlying Fund may also purchase ETF shares for other purposes, including improving its ability to </span><span>track its underlying index.

The </span><span>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </span><span>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the </span><span>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The board of each Fund or the Underlying Fund may, in the future, authorize each Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the </span><span>Underlying Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the Prospectus, </span><span>provided they are consistent with each Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investment objective and do not violate any of its </span><span>investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the Prospectus. Because </span><span>each Fund expects to obtain its exposure to the securities substantially through its investment in the Underlying Fund, </span><span>shareholders should be aware that the risks of investment in particular types of securities, economic sectors and geographic </span><span>locations discussed below may be borne by the Fund through its investment in the Underlying Fund. Through its investment </span><span>in the Underlying Fund, each Fund will also bear the risks described below associated with the Underlying Fund's use of </span><span>portfolio management techniques, such as borrowing arrangements and use of derivatives, in addition to the risks associated </span><span>with those activities if the Funds engage in them directly.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities, including its </span><span>investment in the Underlying Fund, may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the </span><span>portfolio securities, the value of stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors </span><span>does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect </span><span>the economies of many nations and the global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international borders, disruption of </span><span>healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, temporary and permanent business </span><span>closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, credit defaults and other significant economic, social and </span><span>political impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social </span><span>and economic risks in certain countries or globally. These impacts, which could adversely affect a Fund and its investments, </span><span>could be present for an extended period of time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased </span><span>trading costs. Such events may adversely affect a Fund and its investments and may impact a Fund’s ability to purchase or </span><span>sell securities or other assets. Market or economic disruptions could cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a Fund could be adversely impacted if an outbreak impairs the operations of its </span><span>service providers, including BFA. Governmental and quasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak and any resulting </span><span>disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as changes in interest rates. A reversal of these </span><span>policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market volatility, which could adversely affect a Fund’s </span><span>investments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund or the Underlying Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money </span><span>market instruments may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other </span><span>things. If a significant amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the </span><span>Fund to achieve its investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal </span><span>Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market </span><span>fund. Money market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV </span><span>instead of using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's or Underlying Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating </span><span>errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or </span><span>technology failures, that could negatively impact the Funds or Underlying Fund. While service providers are required to have </span><span>appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ </span><span>from a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's in the setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of </span><span>relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take </span><span>appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not </span><span>possible for BFA or the other Fund or Underlying Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect </span><span>a Fund or Underlying Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or </span><span>effects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reference Rate Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently </span><span>transitioned from, or continue to be tied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, </span><span>financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>FCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which </span><span>regulates LIBOR, has ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR </span><span>settings will continue to be published under a synthetic methodology until September 30, 2024 for certain legacy contracts. </span><span>The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight </span><span>collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis </span><span>in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory fallback mechanism to replace </span><span>LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to </span><span>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </span><span>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </span><span>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </span><span>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </span><span>or the Underlying Fund may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in </span><span>the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives. </span><span> </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). The Funds and the Underlying Fund may invest in stock index futures </span><span>contracts, securities options and other derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in </span><span>interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's losses may be greater if it </span><span>invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which </span><span>is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the </span><span>incurrence of leverage.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </span><span>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </span><span>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </span><span>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging </span><span>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risks of Equity Securities. </span><span> </span><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Underlying </span><span>Fund's portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio </span><span>securities, the value of preferred or common stocks in general and other factors that affect the market. An investment in a </span><span>Fund should also be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk </span><span>that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may </span><span>deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of the </span><span>Underlying Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and </span><span>decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on </span><span>various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, </span><span>inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. </span><span>Holders of common stocks incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common </span><span>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from the issuer inferior to the rights of creditors or holders of debt </span><span>obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at </span><span>maturity (whose value, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have </span><span>a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have </span><span>neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's underlying instrument. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make </span><span>daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell </span><span>portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund </span><span>may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </span><span>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </span><span>invest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of loss of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy </span><span>of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will </span><span>be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>The Underlying Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a fund’s performance </span><span>from that of its underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </span><span>instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Fund’s underlying index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Underlying Fund, Underlying Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the </span><span>accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest received by the Underlying Fund or distributions paid to the Underlying </span><span>Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Fund’s underlying </span><span>index or the costs to the Underlying Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may </span><span>be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result </span><span>because a fund incurs fees and expenses, while such a fund’s underlying index does not. When an issuer is introduced by an </span><span>index provider into an index tracked by the Underlying Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such issuer’s securities to </span><span>identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not appear to be supported </span><span>by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short interest or lending </span><span>activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be indicators of possible </span><span>irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud).</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider </span><span>has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to continue to include the issuer’s securities in the re-balancing of its </span><span>index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from the </span><span>Underlying Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to increased tracking error due to the divergence in </span><span>the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s under-weighting or excluding such securities may </span><span>result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the above-mentioned analysis and screening to the </span><span>Underlying Fund and its underlying index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates (without any guarantees). The </span><span>analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from the Underlying Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion </span><span>of such securities will result in an adverse impact to such a Fund’s net asset value if one or more such securities declines in </span><span>value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the changes in and volatility </span><span>of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </span><span>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot </span><span>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </span><span>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in an Underlying Fund's portfolio </span><span>becomes distressed, an Underlying Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical </span><span>and is highly dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long </span><span>periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting </span><span>Countries (</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, </span><span>the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical </span><span>conflicts, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected </span><span>by terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability </span><span>from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and </span><span>gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition </span><span>to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </span><span>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </span><span>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </span><span>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </span><span>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental </span><span>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </span><span>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </span><span>their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. </span><span>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance costs and may </span><span>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to </span><span>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. </span><span>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions </span><span>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </span><span>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to </span><span>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </span><span>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Underlying Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </span><span>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </span><span>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which the Underlying Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government </span><span>regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any </span><span>individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies </span><span>has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including </span><span>interest rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, </span><span>including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and </span><span>general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include </span><span>taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices </span><span>and restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and </span><span>potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on </span><span>their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </span><span>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </span><span>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </span><span>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </span><span>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors.</span><span> </span><span>Aerospace and defense </span><span>companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because </span><span>companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, </span><span>the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental </span><span>defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation </span><span>stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, </span><span>labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant </span><span>government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines </span><span>and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the </span><span>sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product </span><span>liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </span><span>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, </span><span>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </span><span>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. </span><span>Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. </span><span>Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor </span><span>investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </span><span>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in </span><span>senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior claims </span><span>to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary </span><span>considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, an Underlying Fund may at </span><span>times need to request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the </span><span>information otherwise provided to you.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Technology Companies. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological </span><span>advances may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources and personnel. These companies may face rapid </span><span>product obsolescence as well as unexpected risks and costs related to new product introduction and technological </span><span>developments, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Technology companies may be adversely affected by </span><span>disruptions to supply chains and distribution networks as well as issues at third-party partners. They are heavily dependent </span><span>on patent and other intellectual property rights, and the loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect their </span><span>profitability. Technology companies may face increased government scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>legal action. These companies also may be adversely affected by, among other things, actual or perceived security </span><span>vulnerabilities or other defects in their products and services, which may result in lawsuits, government enforcement actions </span><span>and other remediation costs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often </span><span>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </span><span>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </span><span>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience </span><span>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </span><span>of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </span><span>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in the Underlying Funds' portfolio may own or </span><span>operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose </span><span>additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in </span><span>climate conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the </span><span>expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>) governing </span><span>proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </span><span>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures </span><span>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </span><span>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </span><span>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </span><span>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident </span><span>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </span><span>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further </span><span>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Information with respect to how proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period </span><span>ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' </span><span>website at www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On each Business Day (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI), prior to the opening </span><span>of regular trading on the Fund’s primary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on its website (</span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>) certain </span><span>information relating to the portfolio holdings that will form the basis of a Fund’s next net asset value per share calculation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain information may also be made available to certain parties:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Communications of Data Files: </span><span>A Fund may make available through the facilities of the National Securities Clearing </span><span>Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>NSCC</span><span>”</span><span>) or through posting on the </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>, prior to the opening of trading on each business </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund’s industry classifications, </span><span>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </span><span>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give </span><span>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (Each Fund’s total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f- </span><span>4 under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </span><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </span><span>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </span><span>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward </span><span>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </span><span>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies of the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds are subject to the following investment restrictions, all of which are non-fundamental policies:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund may invest in shares of other open-end management investment companies, subject to the limitations of </span><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, including the rules, regulations and exemptive orders obtained thereunder.

For purposes of restriction 3 above, each Fund's transactions will comply as </span><span>of the dates required by amended Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act upon the amended Rule's compliance date. Any change in </span><span>the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or </span><span>other changes in each Fund's total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it </span><span>is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax consequences.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Notwithstanding any other investment policy or restriction (whether or not fundamental), the Underlying Funds in which </span><span>each Fund may invest have adopted certain investment restrictions that may be different from those listed above, thereby </span><span>permitting each Fund to engage indirectly in investment strategies that are prohibited under the restrictions listed above. The </span><span>investment restrictions of each Underlying Fund are set forth in its respective statement of additional information.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </span><span>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Trustees and Officers. </span><span> </span><span>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </span><span>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </span><span>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and </span><span>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</span><span>“</span><span>Independent Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock-advised Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) are organized into the </span><span>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the BlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares Complex (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fund </span><span>Complex</span><span>”</span><span>). Each Fund is included in the iShares Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee </span><span>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the iShares Complex, which consists of 417 funds as </span><span>of June 17, 2024. With the exception of Stephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron Wasserman, the address of each Trustee </span><span>and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman </span><span>is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o BlackRock, Inc., Drapers </span><span>Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United Kingdom. The Board has designated John E. Kerrigan as its </span><span>Independent Board Chair.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </span><span>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</span><span>  </span><span>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L.

(collectively </span><span>referred to in this section as </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </span><span>and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also </span><span>a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed-income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients </span><span>and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>45</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the </span><span>securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>46</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>47</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to, among other things, increase </span><span>or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted </span><span>revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans </span><span>to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this </span><span>conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>allocation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e</span><span>., indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>48</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>49</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>50</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> <div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>51</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and redemption of Creation </span><span>Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized </span><span>Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services </span><span>platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by </span><span>BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to defray transaction expenses and protect against possible shareholder dilution, the Funds may collect certain fees </span><span>from Authorized Participants in connection with creation and redemption transactions. While BlackRock uses good faith </span><span>estimates of the expected costs to the Funds in determining the rates for fees collected by the Funds related to creation and </span><span>redemption activity, BlackRock may have incentives to improve Fund performance through the collection of these fees. As </span><span>these charges are based on estimates, where the charges exceed actual transaction- related costs and/or expenses incurred </span><span>by a Fund, Fund performance could improve as a result. BlackRock has established processes to oversee the determination of </span><span>these estimates in an effort to mitigate this conflict.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. In instances where BlackRock </span><span>charges a unitary management fee, BlackRock may have a financial incentive to use a BlackRock index that is less costly to </span><span>BlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing </span><span>acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are </span><span>under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured </span><span>that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying service providers out of its fees that it receives </span><span>from the Funds, the benefits of lower fees, including any fee discounts or concessions, or any additional savings, may accrue, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>52</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service </span><span>providers to a Fund. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to contractual arrangements with third-party </span><span>service providers to a Fund, or the selection of such providers, particularly in circumstances where BlackRock is negotiating </span><span>on behalf of both funds that have a unitary management fee and those that do not or different service providers have </span><span>different fee structures.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts of interest may arise as a result of simultaneous investment management of multiple client accounts by the </span><span>BlackRock’s investment professionals. For example, differences in the advisory fee structure may create the appearance of </span><span>actual or potential conflicts of interest because such differences could create pecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor one </span><span>client account over another.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </span><span>Distribution Services</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Adviser. </span><span> </span><span>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between </span><span>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </span><span>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory </span><span>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </span><span>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and </span><span>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </span><span>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </span><span>advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </span><span>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may </span><span>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </span><span>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost </span><span>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </span><span>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of </span><span>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </span><span>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund Operating </span><span>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be </span><span>eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>53</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to each Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund, as a percentage of each </span><span>Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.50%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its </span><span>management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the </span><span>Funds in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The contractual waiver may be terminated </span><span>prior to November 30, 2029 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The investment advisory agreement with respect to each Fund continues in effect for two years from its effective date, and </span><span>thereafter is subject to annual approval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as </span><span>defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided that in either event such continuance also is approved by a majority of the </span><span>Board members who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, by a vote cast in person at a </span><span>meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The investment advisory agreement with respect to each Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60 days’ notice, by the Board </span><span>or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act). </span><span>The investment advisory agreement is also terminable upon 60 days’ notice by BFA and will terminate automatically in the </span><span>event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers. </span><span> </span><span>As of April 30, 2024, the individuals named as Portfolio Managers in the Funds' Prospectus were also </span><span>primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of other iShares funds and certain other types of portfolios and/or </span><span>accounts as follows:</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and </span><span>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </span><span>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds (including, if applicable, any underlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-traded</span><span> products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of </span><span>owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ </span><span>participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors </span><span>more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, </span><span>such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development </span><span>of technology platforms and reporting systems (</span><span>“</span><span>Education Costs</span><span>”</span><span>).

In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission </span><span>rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares </span><span>funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other </span><span>iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own </span><span>assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may </span><span>benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </span><span>Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </span><span>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </span><span>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </span><span>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </span><span>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </span><span>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its </span><span>customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and </span><span>BlackRock mutual funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education </span><span>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>FBS</span><span>”</span><span>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span><span>Management, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan </span><span>Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public </span><span>Holdings, Inc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, </span><span>TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial </span><span>Network, LLC.

BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </span><span>Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </span><span>by a Fund is as follows:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>59</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>60</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span><span>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </span><span>other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>61</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>62</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be combined with those of other investment companies, clients or </span><span>accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other </span><span>accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are </span><span>allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this </span><span>procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, </span><span>in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will </span><span>be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the </span><span>Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers </span><span>or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless </span><span>permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year.

Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of </span><span>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </span><span>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </span><span>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a </span><span>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </span><span>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </span><span>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</span></div> <div> <div><span>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </span><span> </span><span>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </span><span>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of securities between its participants (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC Participants</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central </span><span>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </span><span>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>DTCC</span><span>”</span><span>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </span><span>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </span><span>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants.

Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span><span>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </span><span>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any </span><span>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </span><span>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </span><span>cost.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </span><span>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors.

These sales may be effected through </span><span>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or </span><span>through any other means authorized by applicable law.

The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of a </span><span>Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of </span><span>shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Cash Component is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </span><span>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </span><span>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </span><span>Participant purchasing the Creation Unit. Each Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind.

The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to </span><span>adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting a Fund’s portfolio.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities </span><span>portion of the Fund Deposit through </span><span>“</span><span>systematic rounding.</span><span>”</span><span> The rounding methodology </span><span>“</span><span>rounds up</span><span>”</span><span> position sizes of </span><span>securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion).

In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must </span><span>pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus </span><span>the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units. </span><span> </span><span>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </span><span>a Fund, an entity must be: (i) a </span><span>“</span><span>Participating Party,</span><span>”</span><span> i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through </span><span>the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Clearing Process</span><span>”</span><span>), a clearing agency that is registered with the </span><span>SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and </span><span>redemptions of Creation Units (</span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>) (discussed below). A member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with a Fund or one of its service providers that allows </span><span>such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant.</span><span>”</span><span> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede </span><span>&amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Role of the Authorized Participant. </span><span> </span><span>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with a Fund or one of its service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Such Authorized </span><span>Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor </span><span>on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of </span><span>each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next </span><span>determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An </span><span>Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such </span><span>Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not </span><span>Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that </span><span>orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor’s broker through an Authorized Participant. As a </span><span>result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust </span><span>does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list </span><span>of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding </span><span>Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines </span><span>set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection </span><span>with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized </span><span>Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Placement of Creation Orders. </span><span> </span><span>Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. </span><span>government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such </span><span>as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by BNY Mellon or a sub-custodian (a </span><span>“</span><span>Central Depository Account</span><span>”</span><span>). Any portion of the </span><span>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central </span><span>Depository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely </span><span>fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of a Fund </span><span>generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve </span><span>System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite </span><span>number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of a Fund generally </span><span>before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account </span><span>must be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository </span><span>Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The </span><span>“</span><span>Settlement Date</span><span>”</span><span> for all funds is generally the </span><span>first business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the </span><span>validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the </span><span>Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred </span><span>directly to BNY Mellon through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by BNY </span><span>Mellon generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities </span><span>are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice </span><span>to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using the Fund Deposit as newly </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>67</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </span><span>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </span><span>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time </span><span>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </span><span>such Business Day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to a </span><span>Fund, immediately available or same day funds estimated by a Fund to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span><span>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary </span><span>institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff </span><span>Time of a Fund.

Creation Orders must be </span><span>transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by a Fund to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures </span><span>set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other </span><span>communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. A Fund’s </span><span>deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as the Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The Distributor or </span><span>its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant </span><span>at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the </span><span>facilities of the Distributor’s or its agent’s proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption </span><span>requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance </span><span>with a Fund’s Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units. </span><span> </span><span>Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor’s behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>a Fund are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, a Fund will accept </span><span>the order, subject to the Fund’s right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set </span><span>forth below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </span><span>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (e.g., jeopardize the Fund’s tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>68</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, BNY Mellon, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </span><span>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them </span><span>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit. </span><span> </span><span>Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to a </span><span>Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has </span><span>confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered </span><span>to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such </span><span>delivery and a Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+1 basis</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(i.e., one Business Day after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other </span><span>than T+1, including a shorter settlement period, as applicable. For example, a Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+1 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for different </span><span>treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (i.e., the last day the holder of a </span><span>security can sell the security and still receive dividend (payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances. To the </span><span>extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to </span><span>such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part </span><span>or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as </span><span>possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </span><span>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>a Fund. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning a Fund’s current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit a Fund to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Fund of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, each Fund reserves the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by such Fund and the Fund’s determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions. </span><span> </span><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and </span><span>other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. Under an ETF Services Agreement, a Fund has </span><span>retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard </span><span>transaction fee on each creation order, which consists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF Services (the </span><span>“</span><span>ETF Servicing Fee</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>and (2) transfer, processing and other transaction costs charged by a Fund custodian in connection with the issuance of </span><span>Creation Units for such creation order (</span><span>“</span><span>Custody Transaction Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant </span><span>to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to a Fund custodian according to the </span></div> </div> <div><span>amounts invoiced by such custodian.</span><span>  </span><span>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units </span><span>being purchased, which amount will vary among different BlackRock-advised funds based on a number of factors, including </span><span>the complexity of the order and the types of securities or instruments included in a fund’s Creation Basket, among other </span><span>variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per order based on the number of trades, underlying markets and </span><span>settlement locations associated with the issuance of a Creation Unit. The following table sets forth a Fund’s standard creation </span><span>transaction fee that would have been charged as of May 31, 2024, although the actual fee charged to an Authorized </span><span>Participant in connection with a creation order will vary depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than </span></div> <div><span>the fee set forth below.</span><span>  </span><span>If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to </span><span>cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and </span><span>other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, </span><span>be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the </span><span>Deposit Securities to a Fund. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain </span><span>circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be </span></div> <div><span>charged a fee for such services.</span><span>  </span><span>The following table sets forth the Fund’s standard creation transaction fee that would have </span><span>been charged as of May 31, 2024 and maximum additional charge (as described above):</span><span> </span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>69</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until </span><span>such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund </span><span>Securities and Cash Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Procedures and requirements governing </span><span>redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </span><span>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the </span><span>shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund </span><span>Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The Funds generally </span><span>redeem Creation Units for Fund Securities, but the Funds reserve the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation </span><span>Units. A Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs </span><span>from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified </span><span>to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through </span><span>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded </span><span>up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the </span><span>Redemption Basket.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>70</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

However, each </span><span>Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+1, including a shorter settlement period, if </span><span>necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a </span><span>number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled </span><span>market closings, an effort to link distribution to dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the </span><span>extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of </span><span>the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, the Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than </span><span>seven days if the Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.

In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares </span><span>based on the NAV of a Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption </span><span>transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset a Fund’s brokerage and other transaction costs associated </span><span>with the disposition of Fund Securities).

Each Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for a Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for a Fund, as set forth in each Fund’s policies and procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. </span><span> </span><span>An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </span><span>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local </span><span>and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. </span><span>References to the Funds will also generally apply to the Underlying Funds as well.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under </span><span>Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least </span><span>90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and </span><span>meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual </span><span>gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or </span><span>other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, </span><span>futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net </span><span>income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> partnerships that are traded on an established </span><span>securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their income from </span><span>interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each </span><span>Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by cash and cash </span><span>items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>73</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not </span><span>greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's </span><span>total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any </span><span>one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the </span><span>same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </span><span>partnerships.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax</span><span> </span><span>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, </span><span>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, </span><span>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital </span><span>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </span><span>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </span><span>or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </span><span>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the </span><span>Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> the excess of the aggregate </span><span>gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund </span><span>had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excise Tax.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </span><span>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax. Long-term capital distributions from the Underlying Funds paid in December or, in certain cases, January </span><span>in satisfaction of this rule will be subject to potential distribution by the Funds in the following calendar year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.</span><span>  </span><span> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </span><span>Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or distribution </span><span>declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>74</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar </span><span>year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund </span><span>during January of the following calendar year.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income and </span><span>any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss </span><span>carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in </span><span>excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat </span><span>rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital </span><span>gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as </span><span>long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their </span><span>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </span><span>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </span><span>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </span><span>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be </span><span>entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </span><span>with the IRS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term</span><span> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </span><span>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings </span><span>and profits (</span><span>“</span><span>regular dividends</span><span>”</span><span>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified </span><span>dividend income below. Because the Funds are expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales </span><span>of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales.</span><span>”</span><span> Distributions of short-term </span><span>capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by a Fund and would not be offset by a Fund’s </span><span>capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains </span><span>of a Fund. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate </span><span>shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </span><span>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>75</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sales of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of </span><span>mutual funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </span><span>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Treatment of the FLEX Options.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s investments in offsetting positions with respect to the Underlying ETF may be </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The straddle rules may affect the character of gains (or losses) realized by a </span><span>Fund, and losses realized by a Fund on positions that are part of a straddle may be deferred under the straddle rules, rather </span><span>than being taken into account in calculating taxable income for the taxable year in which the losses are realized. In addition, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>76</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>certain carrying charges (including interest expense) associated with positions in a straddle may be required to be capitalized </span><span>rather than deducted currently. Certain elections that a Fund may make with respect to its straddle positions may also affect </span><span>the amount, character and timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the affected positions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The tax consequences of straddle transactions to a Fund are not entirely clear in all situations under currently available </span><span>authority. The straddle rules may increase the amount of short-term capital gain realized by a Fund, which is taxed as </span><span>ordinary income when distributed to U.S. shareholders in a non-liquidating distribution. Because application of the straddle </span><span>rules may affect the character of gains or losses, defer losses and/or accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the </span><span>affected straddle positions, if a Fund makes a non-liquidating distribution of its short-term capital gain, the amount which </span><span>U.S. shareholders must treat as ordinary income may be increased or decreased substantially as compared to a Fund that did </span><span>not engage in such transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The FLEX Options included in the portfolio are exchange-traded options. Under Section 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code, </span><span>certain types of exchange-traded options are treated as if they were sold (i.e., </span><span>“</span><span>marked to market</span><span>”</span><span>) at the end of each year. </span><span>The Funds do not believe that the positions held by the Funds will be subject to Section 1256, which means that the positions </span><span>will not be marked to market, but the positions will be subject to the straddle rules.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (i.e., may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any </span><span>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </span><span>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a </span><span>Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital </span><span>assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be </span><span>treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, </span><span>regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </span><span>more than one year). The cost of any payments made by a Fund on a swap transaction will be netted pro rata against both </span><span>tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize </span><span>income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps </span><span>to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Qualified Dividend Income. </span><span> </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </span><span>capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </span><span>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the </span><span>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. The Funds do not expect that a significant </span><span>portion of their distributions will consist of qualified dividend income or be eligible for the dividends received deduction. </span><span>Qualified dividend income is, in general, dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) </span><span>and certain non-U.S. corporations (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, non-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>77</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Under current IRS </span><span>guidance, the U.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, </span><span>Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate </span><span>jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, </span><span>Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, </span><span>Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Slovak Republic, </span><span>Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, </span><span>Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela.</span><span> </span><span>Substitute payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified </span><span>dividend income.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held </span><span>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </span><span>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those </span><span>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </span><span>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date </span><span>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the </span><span>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to </span><span>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </span><span>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </span><span>as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </span><span>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December </span><span>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified </span><span>business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </span><span>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </span><span>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a </span><span>Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.</span><span>  </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from the Underlying Funds and that are attributable to dividends paid by U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal </span><span>dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 </span><span>days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend</span><span> date for certain preference dividends) during which risk of loss may not be diminished is required for the applicable </span><span>shares, at the Fund level, the Underlying Fund level and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to the investment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excess Inclusion Income. </span><span> </span><span>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</span><span>“</span><span>UBTI</span><span>”</span><span>) from </span><span>being realized by their tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could realize UBTI </span><span>by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt </span><span>shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received by the </span><span>Underlying Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may </span><span>cause the Fund to report some or all of its distributions as </span><span>“</span><span>excess inclusion income.</span><span>”</span><span> To Fund shareholders, such excess </span><span>inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt </span><span>such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not </span><span>be offset by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. </span><span>shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund or Underlying Fund to be subject to tax if certain </span><span>“</span><span>disqualified organizations,</span><span>”</span><span> as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder </span><span>annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a </span><span>taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be </span><span>successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT </span><span>may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </span><span>Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </span><span>investment opportunities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>78</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reporting. </span><span> </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of the </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </span><span>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </span><span>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of the Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term </span><span>capital gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such </span><span>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, the Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </span><span>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole </span><span>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or </span><span>qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of </span><span>these rules to their accounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held more than 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as </span><span>income effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to </span><span>withholding tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A foreign shareholder also may be subject to certain </span><span>“</span><span>wash sale</span><span>”</span><span> rules to prevent the avoidance of the tax filing and payment </span><span>obligations discussed above through the sale and repurchase of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>79</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the responsibility of the BlackRock Investment </span><span>Stewardship (BIS) team.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, sound governance is critical to the success of a company, the protection of investors’ interests, and long-term</span><span> financial value creation. We take a constructive, long-term approach with companies and seek to understand how they </span><span>are managing the drivers of risk and financial value creation in their business models. We have observed that well-managed </span><span>companies will effectively evaluate and address risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses, which supports durable, </span><span>long-term financial value creation. As one of many minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot – and does not try to – direct a </span><span>company’s strategy or its implementation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Shareholders should have the right to:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Elect, remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-</span><span>laws.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes </span><span>to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital </span><span>structure.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Access sufficient and timely information on material governance, strategic, and business matters to make informed </span><span>decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps to achieve this balance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock monitors and provides feedback to companies in our role as stewards of </span><span>our clients’ assets. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>and business practices that support the ability of companies to deliver long-term financial performance for our clients. We do </span><span>this through engagement with companies, proxy voting on behalf of those clients who have given us authority, and </span><span>participating in market-level dialogue to improve corporate governance standards.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and disclosures, particularly where </span><span>our observations indicate that they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial performance. </span><span>Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how they believe </span><span>their actions are aligned with the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Engagement with companies may also </span><span>inform our proxy voting decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a fiduciary, we vote in the long-term economic interests of our clients. Generally, we support the recommendations of the </span><span>board of directors and management. However, there may be instances where we vote against the election of directors or </span><span>other management proposals, or support shareholder proposals. For instance, we may vote against management </span><span>recommendations where we are concerned that the board may not be acting in the long-term economic interests of </span><span>shareholders, or disclosures do not provide sufficient information to assess how material, strategic risks and opportunities </span><span>are being managed. Our regional proxy voting guidelines are informed by our market-specific approach and standards of </span><span>corporate governance best practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets, in our experience, there are </span><span>certain globally-applicable fundamental elements of governance that contribute to a company’s ability to create long-term </span><span>financial value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the </span><span>“</span><span>Principles</span><span>”</span><span>), which </span><span>are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the accepted </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>corporate governance standards in their domestic market and we ask that, if they do not, they explain how their approach </span><span>better supports durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> <div> <div><span>These Principles cover seven key subjects:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Our regional and market-specific </span><span>voting guidelines</span><span> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </span><span>common ballot items for shareholder meetings in those markets. Alongside the Principles and regional voting guidelines, BIS </span><span>publishes our </span><span>engagement priorities</span><span> which reflect the </span><span>five themes</span><span> on which we most frequently engage companies, where </span><span>they are relevant, as these can be a source of material business risk or opportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies set out the </span><span>core elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, </span><span>including when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case </span><span>basis, taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that an effective and well-functioning board that has appropriate governance structures to facilitate oversight of a </span><span>company's management and strategic initiatives is critical to the long-term financial success of a company and the </span><span>protection of shareholders’ economic interests. In our view, a strong board can be a competitive advantage to a company, </span><span>providing valuable oversight of and perspectives to management on the most important decisions in support of long-term </span><span>financial performance. As part of their responsibilities, board members have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the </span><span>strategic direction, operations, and risk management of a company. For this reason, BIS sees engagement with and the </span><span>election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities. Disclosure of material risks that may affect a company’s </span><span>long-term strategy and financial value creation, including material sustainability-related factors when relevant, is essential for </span><span>shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively management is identifying, managing, and mitigating </span><span>such risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms to support its </span><span>oversight of the company’s strategy and operations consistent with the long-term economic interests of investors. There </span><span>should be clear descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how directors engage with and </span><span>oversee management. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these mechanisms in overseeing the </span><span>management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s purpose and strategy.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that its board has fulfilled these corporate governance </span><span>and risk oversight responsibilities, we will consider voting against the election of directors who, on our assessment, have </span><span>particular responsibility for the issues. We assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each </span><span>company’s circumstances, taking into consideration their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term </span><span>financial value creation, and performance. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a </span><span>commitment to acting in the long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular accountability through director elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual director </span><span>elections allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members and/or hold them accountable for their decisions in </span><span>a timely manner. When board members are not elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect </span><span>developments in the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking, while supporting both continuity and appropriate </span><span>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, and seek a balance between the knowledge and </span><span>experience of longer-serving directors and the fresh perspectives of directors who joined more recently. We encourage </span><span>companies to regularly review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated for election </span><span>in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. In our view, the company’s assessment should consider a number </span><span>of factors, including each director’s independence and time commitments, as well as the diversity and relevance of director </span><span>experiences and skillsets, and how these factors may contribute to the financial performance of the company.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Similarly, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence from </span><span>connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. Common </span><span>impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or a subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior, independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to meet with shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to </span><span>explain and contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors, or require additional focus. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board </span><span>forms committees comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in </span><span>audit, director nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special </span><span>transaction, particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual candidates </span><span>so that shareholders can assess the capabilities and suitability of each individual nominee and their fit within overall board </span><span>composition. These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board, as </span><span>well as the particular skill-sets of individual directors, aligns with the company’s long-term strategy and business model. </span><span>Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business and strategy enhance </span><span>the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> when the board advises and oversees management. This position is based on our view </span><span>that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team, and throughout the company – </span><span>leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research has revealed correlations between specific </span><span>dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>1</span><span> In our experience, greater diversity in the </span><span>board room can contribute to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient decisions. Over time, greater </span><span>diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership team, and the workforce more </span><span>broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that better address the needs of the customers and </span><span>communities they serve.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a </span><span>director’s industry experience, specialist areas of expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics </span><span>such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see the most effective boards nominating directors from diverse backgrounds which helps ensure </span><span>boards can more effectively understand the company's customers, employees, and communities. We note that in many </span><span>markets, policymakers have set board gender diversity goals which we may discuss with companies, particularly if there is a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: </span><span>McKinsey</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters,</span><span>”</span><span> May 2022; </span><span>Harvard Business Review</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better,</span><span>”</span><span> September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We encourage boards to aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, while </span><span>recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can take time.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low-carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and note that international </span><span>standards setters, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the International Auditing and </span><span>Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), continue to develop their guidance to companies.</span><span>2</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information and internal control frameworks. Moreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, these committees can </span><span>provide oversight of Enterprise Risk Management systems.</span><span>3</span><span> In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the </span><span>quality and reliability of a company’s financial statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit, and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee the audit process and related activities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit or risk committee, should periodically review the </span><span>company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks and exposures identified by management, </span><span>the internal auditors or the independent auditors and management’s steps to address them. In the absence of detailed </span><span>disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>IFRS, </span><span>“</span><span>IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</span><span>”</span><span>, June 2023, and IAASB, </span><span>“</span><span>IAASB Launches Public </span><span>Consultation on Landmark Proposed Global Sustainability Assurance Standard</span><span>”</span><span>, August 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership and a core principle of effective governance. Shareholders, as the </span><span>residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting the financial value of the company, and voting rights should </span><span>match economic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, </span><span>they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal at the </span><span>company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current </span><span>structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs </span><span>to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction should clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We find long-term investors like our clients typically benefit when proposed transactions have the </span><span>unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that </span><span>the financial interests of executives and/or board members in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to </span><span>place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to </span><span>support should come from the independent directors, a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have </span><span>been assessed through an independent appraisal process. In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate </span><span>vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our view, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria in compensation structures, but in </span><span>our view, where companies choose to include these components, they should be adequately disclosed, material to the </span><span>company’s strategy, and as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans should encompass </span><span>timeframes that 1) are distinct from annual executive compensation structures and metrics, and 2) encourage the delivery of </span><span>strong financial results over a period of years. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements </span><span>that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their employment. Finally, pension </span><span>contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable, in light of market practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>performance.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We encourage boards to consider building clawback provisions into incentive plans such that companies could clawback </span><span>compensation or require executives to forgo awards when compensation was based on faulty financial statements or </span><span>deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from or the foregoing of the grant of any awards by any senior </span><span>executive whose behavior caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or </span><span>resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. BIS </span><span>may signal concerns through not supporting management’s proposals to approve compensation, where they are on the </span><span>agenda. We may also vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor </span><span>compensation practices or structures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. As with all risks and opportunities in a company's business model, appropriate </span><span>oversight of material sustainability considerations is a core component of having an effective governance framework, which </span><span>supports durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Long-term investors like our clients can benefit when companies </span><span>demonstrate that they have a resilient business model through disclosures that cover governance, strategy, risk </span><span>management, and metrics and targets, including industry-specific metrics. The International Sustainability Standards Board </span><span>(ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2,</span><span>4 </span><span>provide companies with a useful guide to preparing this disclosure. The standards build on </span><span>the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics developed by the </span><span>Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which have converged under the ISSB. We recognize that companies may </span><span>phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB standards over several years. We also recognize that some companies may report </span><span>using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we </span><span>ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We note that climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from </span><span>various internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data collection and reporting may not line up </span><span>with financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, </span><span>analyze, and report this data to investors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>That said, to give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and other sustainability-related</span><span> disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting, to the best of their abilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies may also choose to adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by </span><span>supranational organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. </span><span>Further, industry initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best </span><span>practices and disclosures. We find it helpful to our understanding of investment risk when companies disclose any relevant </span><span>global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer </span><span>group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their approach to sustainable </span><span>and responsible business practices. We will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures do not seem adequate in light of the materiality of the business risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate and nature-related risk</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While companies in various sectors and geographies may be affected differently by climate-related risks and opportunities, </span><span>the low-carbon transition is an investment factor that can be material for many companies and economies around the globe.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>The objective of </span><span>IFRS S1</span><span> General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information is to require an entity to disclose </span><span>information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making </span><span>decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. The objective of </span><span>IFRS S2</span><span> Climate-related Disclosures is to require an entity to disclose </span><span>information about its climate-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions </span><span>relating to providing resources to the entity.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We seek to understand, from company disclosures and engagement, the strategies companies have in place to manage </span><span>material risks to, and opportunities for, their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, </span><span>including a scenario in which global warming is limited to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of </span><span>1.5°C. As one of many shareholders, and typically a minority one, BlackRock does not tell companies what to do. It is the role </span><span>of the board and management to set and implement a company's long-term strategy to deliver long-term financial returns.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Our research shows that the low-carbon transition is a structural shift in the global economy that will be shaped by changes </span><span>in government policies, technology, and consumer preferences, which may be material for many companies.</span><span>5</span><span> Yet the path to </span><span>a low-carbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different speeds. BIS </span><span>recognizes that it can be challenging for companies to predict the impact of climate-related risk and opportunity on their </span><span>businesses and operating environments. Many companies are assessing how to navigate the low-carbon transition while </span><span>delivering long-term value to investors. In this context, we encourage companies to publicly disclose, consistent with their </span><span>business model and sector, how they intend to deliver long-term financial performance through the transition to a low-carbon</span><span> economy. Where available, we appreciate companies publishing their transition plan.</span><span>6</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with the ISSB standards, we are better able to assess preparedness for the low-carbon transition when companies </span><span>disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based where these are available for their sector, for scope 1 </span><span>and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their targets are consistent with the long-term </span><span>financial interests of their investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we recognize that regulators in some markets are moving to mandate certain disclosures, at this stage, we view scope </span><span>3 emissions differently from scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns about </span><span>double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. We welcome disclosures and commitments companies choose to </span><span>make regarding scope 3 emissions and recognize these are provided on a good-faith basis as methodology develops. Our </span><span>publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to climate-related risks and opportunities, the management of nature-related factors is increasingly a component </span><span>of some companies’ ability to generate durable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s </span><span>strategy is heavily reliant on the availability of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related</span><span> risks. We look for such companies to disclose how they manage any reliance and impact on, as well as use of, natural </span><span>capital, including appropriate risk oversight and relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated </span><span>into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related </span><span>risks and opportunities, as well as in our assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary </span><span>provides more information on our approach to natural capital.</span><span>7</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. For many companies, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. In addition to understanding broader </span><span>stakeholder relationships, BIS finds it helpful when companies consider the needs of their workforce today, and the skills </span><span>required for their future business strategy. We are also interested to understand the role of the board, which is well positioned </span><span>to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s strategy and purpose.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock Investment Institute, </span><span>“</span><span>Tracking the low-carbon transition</span><span>”</span><span>, July 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> <div><span>We have observed that more companies are developing such plans, and public policy makers in a number of markets are signaling their intentions to </span><span>require them. We view transition plans (TPs) as a method for a company to both internally assess and externally communicate long-term strategy, </span><span>ambition, objectives, and actions to create financial value through the global transition towards a low-carbon economy. While many initiatives across </span><span>jurisdictions outline a framework for TPs, there is no consensus on the key elements these plans should contain. We view useful disclosure as that </span><span>which communicates a company’s approach to managing financially material, business relevant risks and opportunities – including climate-related </span><span>risks – to deliver long-term financial performance, thus enabling investors to make more informed decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> <div><span>Given the growing awareness of the materiality of these issues for certain businesses, enhanced reporting on a company's natural capital </span><span>dependencies and impacts would aid investors’ understanding. In our view, the final recommendations of the </span><span>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures</span><span> may prove useful to some companies. We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may be required </span><span>by regulation, or one of a number of other private sector standards.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies should articulate how they address material adverse impacts that could arise from their business practices and </span><span>affect critical relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the extent appropriate, </span><span>monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse impacts and grievance </span><span>mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within these relationships can </span><span>contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of the </span><span>companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess the effectiveness of the board’s oversight of management and whether investors’ economic interests </span><span>have been protected. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate form</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>8</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or similar </span><span>entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting documentation </span><span>from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate how the interests </span><span>of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting mechanisms that </span><span>would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management proposals if our </span><span>analysis indicates that shareholders’ economic interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock </span><span>can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder </span><span>proposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by others.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term financial value creation by that company. We believe it is helpful for companies to disclose the names of the </span><span>proponent or organization that has submitted or advised on the proposal. We consider the business and economic relevance </span><span>of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which our experience indicates it should be addressed. We </span><span>would not support proposals that we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company. </span><span>We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding </span><span>depending on the jurisdiction, while others may make requests that would be deemed illegal in a given jurisdiction.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material business risk that we agree needs to be addressed and the intended outcome is </span><span>consistent with long-term financial value creation, we will look to the board and management to demonstrate that the </span><span>company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis and/or engagement </span><span>indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support shareholder proposals that </span><span>are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that some shareholder proposals bundle topics and/or specific requests and include supporting statements </span><span>that explain the reasoning or objectives of the proponent. In voting on behalf of clients, we do not submit or edit proposals or </span><span>the supporting statements – we must vote yes or no on the proposal as phrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we vote </span><span>in support of a proposal, we are not necessarily endorsing every element of the proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or </span><span>supporting statement of the proponent. We may support a proposal for different reasons from those put forth by the </span><span>proponent, when we believe that, overall, it can advance our clients' long-term financial interests. We would normally explain </span><span>to the company our rationale for supporting such proposals.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Alternatively, or in addition, we may vote against the election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has </span><span>not responded sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. We may also support a proposal if management is on </span><span>track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate efforts to address a material risk.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or </span><span>senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on </span><span>amendments to BIS regional proxy voting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering markets within each respective region. The </span><span>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </span><span>(Global Oversight Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock </span><span>investment teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior </span><span>executives with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </span><span>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the Guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS carries out engagement with companies, executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining </span><span>records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate </span><span>governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important developments in </span><span>the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of </span><span>those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant </span><span>investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote execution</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock votes on proxy issues when our clients authorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been authorized to vote on </span><span>behalf of our clients, we carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for </span><span>which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting </span><span>authority based on our evaluation of the alignment of the voting items with the long-term economic interests of our clients, </span><span>in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or </span><span>any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s </span><span>affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </span><span>“</span><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures,</span><span>”</span><span> below).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When exercising voting rights, BIS will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </span><span>relevant market, as well as the Global Principles. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with </span><span>changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by </span><span>the applicable Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude </span><span>that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the </span><span>Guidelines would be in the long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on an assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BIS’ ability to vote such proxies, as well as the </span><span>desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii) </span><span>restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs (including </span><span>but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are </span><span>expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Active portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the </span><span>economic impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing </span><span>views on how to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and </span><span>sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because </span><span>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are generally cast in a uniform </span><span>manner.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Choice</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock offers a Voting Choice program, which provides eligible clients with more opportunities to participate in the proxy </span><span>voting process where legally and operationally viable. BlackRock Voting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier and more </span><span>accessible for eligible clients.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Choice is currently available for eligible clients invested in certain institutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK, Ireland, and </span><span>Canada that utilize equity index investment strategies, as well as eligible clients in certain institutional pooled funds in the </span><span>U.S., UK, and Canada that use systematic active equity (SAE) strategies. Currently, this includes over 650 pooled investment </span><span>funds, including equity index funds and SAE investment funds. In addition, institutional clients in separately managed </span><span>accounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their investment strategies.</span><span>9</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third-party policy, or have </span><span>elected to vote shares in accordance with their own policy. Agreements with our clients to allow them greater control over </span><span>their voting, including which policies they have selected, will be treated confidentially consistent with our treatment of similar </span><span>client agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </span><span>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees. The following are </span><span>examples of sources of perceived or potential conflicts of interest:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock clients who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock business partners or third parties who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock employees who may sit on the boards of public companies held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Significant BlackRock, Inc. investors who may be issuers of securities held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Securities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock investment funds held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, Inc. board members who serve as senior executives or directors of public companies held in Funds managed </span><span>by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has taken certain steps to mitigate perceived or potential conflicts including, but not limited to, the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to advance our clients’ long-term economic interests in the companies in </span><span>which BlackRock invests on their behalf</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Established a reporting structure that separates BIS from employees with sales, vendor management, or business </span><span>partnership roles.

In such circumstances, the independent third-party </span><span>voting service provider provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote </span><span>such proxies.

We may engage more than one independent third-party voting service </span><span>provider, in part to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider.

Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns while allowing fund </span><span>providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on loan and may </span><span>determine to recall them for voting, as guided by our fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ financial interests. While this </span><span>has occurred in a limited number of cases, the decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending </span><span>program in order to vote is based on an evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential </span><span>securities lending revenue alongside the potential long-term financial value to clients of voting those securities (based on the </span><span>information available at the time of recall consideration).</span><span>10</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and </span><span>Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term financial value to the Fund of voting shares would </span><span>be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in </span><span>our independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to </span><span>clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the U.S., for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting typically </span><span>falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a material </span><span>impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh independent </span><span>business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date without </span><span>knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending revenue for </span><span>the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The voting guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s general </span><span>philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we invest. The </span><span>Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the </span><span>individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate how </span><span>BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight </span><span>into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots. As previously discussed, the Guidelines </span><span>should be read in conjunction with the Principles and engagement priorities. Collectively, these </span><span>“</span><span>BIS policies</span><span>”</span><span> set out the core </span><span>elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, including </span><span>when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case basis, </span><span>taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>11</span><span> Additionally, we make public our regional </span><span>proxy voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and the companies in which we invest on their behalf. We also publish </span><span>commentaries to share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At a more granular level, on a quarterly basis, we publish our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting </span><span>during the period, showing how BIS voted on each proposal and providing our rationale for any votes against management </span><span>proposals or on shareholder proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest </span><span>to clients, we may publish a vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also </span><span>publish a quarterly list of all companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </span><span>practices that support durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> <div><span>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
