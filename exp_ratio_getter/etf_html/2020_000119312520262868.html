<p><font size="2">A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940 Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by
the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that
issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund
cannot change its classification from diversified to <font>non-diversified</font> without shareholder approval. However, while the Fund is classified as “diversified,” under applicable <font>no-action</font> relief from the SEC staff, the Fund may become <font>non-diversified,</font> as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index
weighting of one or more constituents of its Underlying Index and such a change does not require shareholder approval. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you have any questions, please
