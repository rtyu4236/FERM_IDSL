being set by taking the total outstanding index market value of each country and dividing by the total outstanding index market value of all countries included in the Underlying Index. Weightings are then adjusted to ensure that no single country
has a weight greater than 23.00%, the sum of countries with weightings greater than 5.00% is less than or equal to 48.00% and all other issuers are capped at 4.70%. Additional adjustments may be made to minimize deviations from initial market value
across countries. The weighting of each eligible bond within a given country is calculated as the market value of that bond divided by the total market value of all eligible bonds within that country. The weighting of each eligible bond in an
Underlying Index is therefore the weighting of that bond within its country multiplied by the weighting of that country within the Underlying Index. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Each Underlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced on a monthly basis. Additions, deletions and other changes to each Underlying Index arising from the rebalancing
are made provided the security’s reference information and pricing are available by designated pricing and data providers on the rebalancing reference date. Changes to each Underlying Index are published on the announcement date and become

<p><font size="2"><b>Index Description.</b> The S&amp;P International Sovereign <font>Ex-U.S.</font> Bond Index is a broad, diverse, market value-weighted
index designed to measure the performance of sovereign bonds issued in local currencies by developed market countries, as classified by SPDJI, outside the U.S. The weight of each country in the Underlying Index is based on the total outstanding
index market value of the country. The Underlying Index methodology is designed to limit the weights of the countries above a predetermined threshold. </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2"><b>Index Methodology.</b> In order for a bond to be considered for inclusion in the Underlying Index, it must be
issued in its local currency by a country that is outside of the U.S. and considered a developed market, as classified by SPDJI, and that represents a certain minimum weight of the eligible universe. For a country to be included in the Underlying
Index at inception, that country’s outstanding bond issuance must have a market value greater than or equal to 25 basis points of the total eligible universe of developed markets. The Underlying Index is reviewed annually, and a country may
only be added at that time if it has a market value outstanding greater than or equal to 50 basis points of the total eligible universe. Any country currently in the Underlying Index is removed at any subsequent annual review in which it has a
market weight of less than 10 basis points of the total eligible universe. Country composition as well as addition and deletion thresholds are reviewed by SPDJI on an annual basis. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Component Selection Criteria.</b> In order to be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, a security must (i) be issued by the government of an eligible country as noted above, (ii) be issued in
the currency of the country of domicile, (iii) have a maturity of greater than one year, (iv) be included and priced in the Thomson Reuters database and (v) have a current minimum face amount outstanding based on the following
minimums by country: Australia (1 bn – Australian Dollar), Austria (2.5 bn – Euro), Belgium (2.5 bn – Euro), Canada (2.5 bn – Canadian Dollar), Denmark (20 bn – Danish Krone), Finland (2.5 bn – Euro), France (2.5
bn – Euro), Germany (2.5 bn – Euro), Ireland (2.5 bn – Euro), Italy (2.5 bn – Euro), Japan (500 bn – Japanese Yen), the Netherlands (2.5 bn – Euro), New Zealand (1 bn – New Zealand Dollar), Norway (20 bn
– Norwegian Krone), Portugal (2.5 bn – Euro), Singapore (1.5 bn – Singapore Dollar), Spain (2.5 bn – Euro), Sweden (25 bn – Swedish Krona), Switzerland (4 bn – Swiss Franc) and U.K. (2 bn – Pound Sterling).
