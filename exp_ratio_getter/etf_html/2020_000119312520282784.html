<p><font size="2"><b>The first two paragraphs of the section of the iShares Emerging Markets Dividend ETF’s SAI entitled
“Diversification Status” are hereby restated as follows: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund is classified as a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This means that
the Fund may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total
assets, (a) more than 5% of the Fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total
assets, the Fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its classification from diversified to nondiversified without shareholder approval. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Fund intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company for
purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided
that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it less likely that the Fund will meet its
investment objective. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you have any questions, please call 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737). </font></p>
