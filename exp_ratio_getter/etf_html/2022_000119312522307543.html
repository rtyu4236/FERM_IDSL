The Underlying Index is designed to provide exposure to U.S.-based companies that return capital to shareholders through either dividend payments or share buybacks. The Underlying Index consists of companies with the largest dividend and buyback programs in the market measured by adjusted shareholder yield, as determined by Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar” or the “Index Provider”). The Index Provider’s adjusted shareholder yield calculation gives a 75% weighting to dividend yields and 25% weighting to net buyback yields.

The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <div><span></span><span><span>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” </span></span></div> <div>The section entitled “Communication Services Sector Risk” on pages 11‑12 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.</div> <div>The following section is added to the section “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” of the Prospectus:</div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk.</span> The success of companies in the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions; war or other geopolitical conflicts; and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. There may also be increased impacts on the value of the investments in the Fund as a result of geographic concentration in locations where the value of the investments in the Fund may be more susceptible to adverse physical climate events, as well as social and governance factors. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political strife or natural disasters. Any such</div> <div></div> <hr/> <div>event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (<span>e.g.</span>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</div> <div>In the context of the COVID‑19 outbreak and disputes among oil‑producing countries regarding potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front month WTI crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time. Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the U.S. announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect of the U.S. ban and any similar bans by other countries, as well as the extent and duration of the Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Fund.</div> <div><span></span><span><span>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes” </span></span></div> <div>The section entitled “Morningstar<sup>®</sup> US Dividend and Buyback Index<sup>SM</sup>” on page 34 of the SAI is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</div> <div>Morningstar<sup>®</sup> US Dividend and Buyback Index<sup>SM</sup></div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 388 </span></div> <div><span>Index Description.</span> The Morningstar<sup>®</sup> US Dividend and Buyback Index<sup>SM</sup> is designed to provide exposure to U.S.- based companies that return capital to shareholders through either dividend payments or share buybacks.
