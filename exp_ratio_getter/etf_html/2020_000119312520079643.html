<p><font size="2"><b>for the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) (the “Fund”) </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>The information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus for the Fund. </i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Effective immediately, the Fund’s Summary Prospectus and Prospectus are amended as follows: </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Summary of Principal Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The “Index-Related Risk”
section of the Summary Prospectus is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Index-Related Risk. </b>There is no guarantee that
the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the
Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index or may cause the Fund to temporarily invest less than 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index, particularly around
any time the Underlying Index rebalances. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index
Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The “Index-Related Risk”
section of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Index-Related Risk.</b> The Fund seeks to achieve a return
that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index or may cause the Fund to temporarily invest less than 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index, particularly around any time
the Underlying Index rebalances. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying
Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents
provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s
methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or
any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or
at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains
incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by
the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Apart from
scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and
the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by
the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund. </font></p>
