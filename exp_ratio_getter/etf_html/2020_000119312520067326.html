prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other instrument may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the
issuer of the security or other instrument, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset

This coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines,
cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The impact of <font>COVID-19,</font> and other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future,
could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. In addition, the impact of infectious illnesses in emerging market countries may
be greater due to generally less established healthcare systems. Public health crises caused by the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries
or globally. The duration of the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak and its effects cannot be determined with certainty. </font></p> <p><font size="1"> </font></p>
