methodology. Underlying Index constituents are drawn from the pool of stocks issued by U.S. based companies that trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NYSE Amex Equities or The NASDAQ Stock Market
(“NASDAQ”). The Morningstar index methodology defines <font>“mid-capitalization”</font> stocks as those stocks that generally fall between the 70th and 90th percentile of the market capitalization of
the stocks eligible to be included in the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Market Extended Index</font><font size="1"><sup>SM</sup></font><font size="2"> (a diversified broad market index that represents approximately 99.5% of the market

“growth” or “value” based on their style orientations.

<p><font size="2"><b><i>Healthcare Sector Risk.</i></b><b> </b>The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among
others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical
products and services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of

competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The
process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of
legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector. </font></p>

changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global
events, trade disputes and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by
liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector,
particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services. </font></p>
