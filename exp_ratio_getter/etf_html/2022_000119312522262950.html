<p><b>Supplement dated October 14, 2022 (the “Supplement”) </b></p>
<p><b>to the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus, each dated March 1, 2022 (as revised June 1, 2022), and the Statement of Additional Information
(the “SAI”), dated March 1, 2022 (as revised October 7, 2022), for the iShares<sup>®</sup> iBonds<sup>®</sup> 2022 Term High Yield and
Income ETF (IBHB) (the “Fund”) </b></p> <p><b></b><b><i>The information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, the
Summary Prospectus, Prospectus, and the SAI for the Fund. </i></b></p> <p>On March 12, 2019, in connection with the establishment of the Fund, the Board of Trustees of
the Trust approved the planned liquidation, dissolution and termination of the Fund. As a result, the last day of trading in the Fund on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”) will be December 15, 2022. Cboe BZX will suspend trading in
the Fund before the open of trading on December 16, 2022 and shares of the Fund will no longer be available for new investments as of this date. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on December 21,
2022. The Fund’s final net asset value, as calculated on December 15, 2022, will include any costs associated with the liquidation expected to be borne by the Fund. </p>
<p>Because shares of the Fund will not be traded on Cboe BZX during the period between December 16, 2022 and December 21, 2022, we cannot assure you that there
will be a trading market for your shares. Further, during this period, the Fund will be in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio, which may result in the Fund not being able to track its Underlying Index (by December 16,
2022, the Underlying Index value will be represented almost entirely by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying Index). After December 15, 2022, shareholders that remain invested in the Fund will receive the entire amount of their
pro rata share of the liquidation proceeds on or about December 21, 2022, subject to their brokerage firm’s processes. </p> <p>Shareholders may sell their
holdings of the Fund prior to December 16, 2022 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. If you still hold shares of the Fund on December 21, 2022, the Fund will automatically
redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value as of the close of business on December 15, 2022, which will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date. </p>

<p>If you are subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A
sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare tax exempt or taxable distributions of its
investment income and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss
depending on your tax basis. Please refer to the “Taxes” disclosure beginning on page 122 of the SAI and consult your own tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of the Fund’s liquidation, including any state, local, foreign
or other tax consequences. </p> <p>If you have any questions, please call <font><font>1-800-iShares</font></font> <font><font><font>(1-800-474-2737).</font></font></font> </p> <p> </p>
