<div>The iShares Adaptive Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization equities from developed market countries which use the euro as their official currency while dynamically hedging currency risk for a U.S.
dollar based investor.</div> <div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Eurozone ETF (“EZU” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EZU, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written
agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also incur usual
and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate
for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 7% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI EMU
Adaptive Hedge to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”) as an equity benchmark for the</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Economic and Monetary Union (the “EMU”) countries with the foreign
currency exposure of the securities included in the Underlying Index dynamically hedged against the U.S. dollar determined systematically by four currency risk indicators: carry, momentum, value, and volatility. As of August 31, 2018, the Underlying
Index consisted of securities from the following 10 countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August
31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> </div>

<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities
not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable)
designed to hedge against non-U.S. currency fluctuations. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, which attempts to mitigate currency risk, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s holdings in component securities denominated in a non-U.S. dollar currency. A foreign
currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund’s exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the
exposure of the Fund to the component securities and a hedge ratio (“Hedge Ratio”), as calculated by MSCI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index applies a methodology, based on the Hedge
Ratio, that sells the total value or a portion of the total value of each non-U.S. dollar currency in which the securities of the Underlying Index are denominated in the form of a one-month currency contract to create a “hedge” against
fluctuations in the relative value of the euro in relation to the U.S. dollar. The Hedge Ratio is based on four commonly used indicators for measuring currency risk, which are equally weighted and include: value (relative purchasing power</div>

<div>between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar based on exchange rates over
a long-term average), momentum (relative price momentum of the foreign currency compared against the U.S. dollar over the previous six months), carry (differences in short-term interest rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar over a
long-term average), and volatility (relative price volatility of the foreign currency based on the currency’s one-month average against its six-month average). The overall effect, since the four indicators are equally weighted, is that each
foreign currency represented by constituent weights in the Underlying Index can be unhedged, 25% hedged, 50% hedged, 75% hedged or fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The hedge (based on the Hedge Ratio) is reset on a monthly
basis by MSCI and will not be adjusted intra-month based on movement in the value of the underlying equity securities and/or currencies, or based on the four indicators. The Underlying Index may therefore be slightly “over-hedged” (if
equity values decline) or “under-hedged” (if the equity values increase) between the month-end rebalances. The Underlying Index is therefore intended to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is
weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is therefore intended to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is strengthening relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>While the use of foreign currency forward contracts, based on
the Hedge Ratio, is designed to minimize the impact of the strengthening or weakening of a foreign currency on Fund returns, it does not necessarily</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the euro. The return of the foreign
currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may use non-deliverable forward (“NDF”)
contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash
settlement will be made by one party to the other.</div> <div>The
Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by the Index Provider, which
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to
proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds
(“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance

<div>effective.</div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation
where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may
not be fully hedged to the extent indicated by the Hedge Ratio, as determined by the indicators described in the Fund's principal investment strategies. In addition, the hedge is reset on a monthly basis and</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>will not be adjusted during the month based on movement in the value of the
component securities or currency. As a result, the Underlying Index may be “over-hedged” or “under-hedged” between month-end rebalances. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is
possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully
reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the
Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy as calculated by MSCI. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates.
Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar and the depreciation of one currency is
not offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro will reduce the value of a security denominated
in the euro. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing
an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency
exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations,
potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such
plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of
securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the euro as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a
derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could</font></div> </div>

<div>also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of
unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could
cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more
costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the
Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by
applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology
malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific
geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct investment in
the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO
NAV.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities
may be more volatile and less liquid.</font></div> <div>Model Risk<font>.</font><font> Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the allocation and hedging model used to calculate the Underlying Index will achieve its intended
results.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>price for the underlying security
(<font>i.e</font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be
greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small
number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade
a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to
</font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in
this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic
Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic
and other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed
countries have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments. In addition, developed</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of
certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Europe<font>.</font><font> The Fund is more exposed to the economic and political risks of Europe and of the European countries in which it invests than funds whose investments
are more geographically diversified. Adverse economic and political events in Europe may cause the Fund’s investments to decline in value. The economies and markets of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and
events in one country in Europe can have an adverse impact on other European countries. The Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have significant operations in, member states of the European Union (the
“EU”) that are subject to economic and monetary controls that can adversely affect the Fund’s investments. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years and these events have
adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect other European countries.  In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU. The referendum may
introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in France. <font>The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in French issuers subjects the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to
France. Recently, new concerns emerged with respect to the economic outlook for</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>certain EU countries, including France. External demand for French exports is
expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K.'s resolution to leave the EU. As a result, the French economy may experience adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn, potential weakness in exports, high rates of unemployment
and rising government debt levels. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the French economy. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports,
and as a result, is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products. France has experienced several terrorist attacks over the past several years, creating a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Germany. <font>The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments in German issuers may subject the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks
specific to Germany. Recently, new concerns have emerged in relation to the economic health of the EU, which have led to downward pressure on the earnings of certain financial institutions, including German financial services companies. Secessionist
movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the German economy. Germany has an export dependent economy and therefore relies heavily on trade with key trading partners,
including the Netherlands, China, the U.S., the U.K., France, Italy and other European countries. Germany is dependent on the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>economies of these other countries, and any change in the price or demand for
German exports may have an adverse impact on its economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's
or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social
instability.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or
permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any.
Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders
being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal
income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income
the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps
is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”).</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the
Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment
portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the
New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts
included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security, instrument
or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for
other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's or the
Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they
would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by
pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or
redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater
settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions, if
implemented, will be effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge
the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to
post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek
to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may
not be fully hedged to the extent indicated by the Hedge Ratio, as determined by the indicators described in the Fund's principal investment strategies or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments
from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>influence prices and may adopt policies designed to influence foreign exchange
rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is
possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully
reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with
respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number
of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>There is no assurance that the Fund’s strategy will be
effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the
U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy as calculated by MSCI. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency
hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging
strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the
local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
euro or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the Fund’s
attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities comprising the Underlying
Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange
rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s
investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a
fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to
hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to
hedge its foreign currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or</font></div> </div>

<div>inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or the
Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are
inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans
and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively
impacted as a result.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging
strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk,
which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly
with the currency or currencies being hedged. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the
Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated
market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the
Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives
may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>

<div>and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in
Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default
or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets
have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,
Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The
outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty
and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to
instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and
the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal
consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and
investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks
to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div> <div>Secessionist
movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics
of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political</div> </div>

<div>unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in
sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the
value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div> <div>Financials
Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can
charge, the amount of capital they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may
change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory
burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater
overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks
may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials
sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in
particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also
a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to
companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and
are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the
Fund.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the
Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the

<div>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or
accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s
mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s
errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all,
particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be
underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its
shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div> </div>

<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from

<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to
be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to
mitigate the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through
Creation Unit transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more
likely that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the
NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of
significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund
shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</div>
<div>Model Risk.<font> Neither the Fund
nor BFA can offer assurances that the allocation and hedging model used to calculate the Underlying Index will achieve its intended results.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk.<font> The
Fund is classified as “non-diversified.” This means that the Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to the risks
associated with these particular issuers or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting these issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

<div>providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address
significant operational risks.</div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or
representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economies of some countries or regions in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of these
countries or regions, institution of tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of their key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such countries or regions
and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund or the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary
means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in
other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes,
historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund or
the Underlying Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of
recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed
country economies.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Europe. <font>The Fund is more exposed to the economic and political risks of Europe and of the European countries in which it invests than are funds whose investments are more geographically diversified. Adverse economic and
political events in Europe may cause the Fund’s investments to decline in value. The economies and markets of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one country in Europe can have an adverse impact on
other European countries. The Fund and Underlying Fund make investments in securities of issuers</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>that are domiciled in, or have significant operations in, member states of the
EU. The EU requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those
countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by
an EU member state on its sovereign debt, or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have experienced
volatility and adverse trends in recent years due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect other European countries. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including
austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other
entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions,
especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (Brexit). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and
instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K.
businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European
or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent
national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has
exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe,
but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a
period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>

strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such
as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout
Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value of the Fund. The Fund’s investments could be negatively impacted by any economic
or political instability in any European country.</div> <div>Risk of
Investing in France.<font> Investment in French issuers subjects the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to France. Recently, new concerns
emerged in relation to the economic health of the EU. These concerns have led to downward pressure on certain EU member states, including France. Interest rates on France’s debt may rise to levels that make it difficult for it to service high
debt levels without significant financial help from, among others, the European Central Bank and could potentially result in default. In addition, the French economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of certain key trading
partners, including Germany and other Western European countries. External demand for French exports is expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K.'s resolution to leave the EU. Reduction in spending on French products and services, or changes in
any of the economies may cause an adverse impact on the French economy. In addition, France has been subject to acts of terrorism, which has created a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism and may lead to further adverse
economic consequences. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the French economy. The French economy is dependent on exports from the agricultural
sector. Leading agricultural exports include dairy products, meat, wine, fruit and vegetables, and fish. As a result, the French economy is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Germany.<font>
Investment in German issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to Germany. Recently, new concerns have emerged in relation to the economic health of the
EU. These concerns have led to downward pressure on the earnings of certain financial institutions, including German financial services companies. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the German economy. The German economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of certain key trading partners, including the Netherlands, China, the U.S., the U.K., France, Italy and other
European countries. Reduction in spending on German products and services, or changes in any of the economies may have an adverse impact on the German economy. In addition, heavy regulation of labor, energy and product markets in Germany may have an
adverse impact on German issuers. Such regulations may negatively impact economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities</font></div>

<div>in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also
lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the
Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending
program.</div> <div>Security Risk.
<font>Some geographic areas in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns
and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies and the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
political, economic, legal and currency risks could contribute to a high degree of price volatility in the equity markets of some of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest and could adversely affect investments in the Fund
or the Underlying Fund.</font></div> <div>Political and Social Risk<font>. Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence and labor unrest in some of the countries in
which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses.</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. Some countries
in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest may experience economic instability, including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a
negative effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available
currency hedging instruments.</font></div> <div>Expropriation Risk<font>. Investments in certain countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign
investments and repatriation of capital.</font></div> <div>Large
Government Debt Risk<font>. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the Fund or the Underlying
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative
pronouncements issued by the IRS.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error
Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected
securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between
which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may
experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things,
differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is
a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, certain country or countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be particularly
affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the
economic conditions of such countries and, as a result, securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because
non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing
market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could
result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares,
or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors
by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other
derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings
and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment;
and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit
the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a
material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or
other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a
risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (<font>e.g.</font>, oil and natural gas) and services,
exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if
there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be
unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction,</font></div>

<div>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of
qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font>
Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater competition and may adversely affect their profitability. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of
business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities
industry may have difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; face restrictions on operations and increased cost and
delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels
or the effects of man-made or natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore
may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that regulatory
authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks issued by a utility company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a significant
adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in foreign
currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations, inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index, based on MSCI’s calculation methodology. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to
brokers, dealers and financial institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus and in the Fund’s
SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to invest the Fund’s
assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund achieves its investment
objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund  and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI EMU Index. The MSCI EMU Index is a servicemark of the Index Provider and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The Underlying Fund
is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by the Index Provider and the Index Provider makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment
profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental
characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold
certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EZU, after taking into account any fee waivers by EZU, plus 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances
(such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in
other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase, or distribute or sell services or products
from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection
with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and
compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies
that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference
to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are
owned by the Fund.</div> <div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is
under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may
differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary
or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>

<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “DEZU.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe BZX.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current
market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other
instruments held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day.
The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of
certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to
its accuracy.</div> <div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not
readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer
appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or
closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities,
that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or
highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair
valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation
of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an
arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during
the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying
Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received

distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a
corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends
received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes

an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income

<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund or to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use
foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div> </div>

<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>

including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be
executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</div>
<div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the
Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any securities used
to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified
institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are</font></div> </div>

<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,

reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Japan ETF (“EWJ” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWJ through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of
the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also incur usual and customary

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate for
the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 5% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Japan Adaptive Hedge to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”) as an equity benchmark for</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>stocks traded primarily on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with the foreign currency
exposure of the securities included in the Underlying Index dynamically hedged against the U.S. dollar determined systematically by four currency risk indicators: carry, momentum, value, and volatility. The Underlying Index may include large- and
mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary and industrials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index
are likely to change over time.</div> <div>Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>of the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward
contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge against non-U.S. currency fluctuations. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, which attempts to mitigate currency risk, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s holdings in component securities denominated in a non-U.S. dollar currency. A foreign
currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund’s exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the
exposure of the Fund to the component securities and a hedge ratio (“Hedge Ratio”), as calculated by MSCI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index applies a methodology, based on the Hedge
Ratio, that sells the total value or a portion of the total value of each non-U.S. dollar currency in which the securities of the Underlying Index are denominated in the form of a one-month currency contract to create a “hedge” against
fluctuations in the relative value of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar. The Hedge Ratio is based on four commonly used indicators for measuring currency risk, which are equally weighted and include: value (relative purchasing power
between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar based on exchange rates over a long-term average), momentum (relative price momentum of the foreign currency compared against the U.S.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>dollar over the previous six months), carry (differences in short-term
interest rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar over a long-term average), and volatility (relative price volatility of the foreign currency based on the currency’s one-month average against its six-month average). The overall
effect, since the four indicators are equally weighted, is that each foreign currency represented by constituent weights in the Underlying Index can be unhedged, 25% hedged, 50% hedged, 75% hedged or fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The hedge (based on the Hedge Ratio) is reset on a monthly
basis by MSCI and will not be adjusted intra-month based on movement in the value of the underlying equity securities and/or currencies, or based on the four indicators. The Underlying Index may therefore be slightly “over-hedged” (if
equity values decline) or “under-hedged” (if the equity values increase) between the month-end rebalances. The Underlying Index is therefore intended to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Japanese yen is
weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is therefore intended to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Japanese yen is strengthening relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>While the use of foreign currency forward contracts, based on
the Hedge Ratio, is designed to minimize the impact of the strengthening or weakening of a foreign currency on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese yen. The return of the foreign currency forward
contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>in value between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may use non-deliverable forward (“NDF”)
contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash
settlement will be made by one party to the other.</div> <div>The
Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by the Index Provider, which
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>

ability to meet its investment objective.</div> <div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed

Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading
volumes.</div> <div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's

<div>derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the
calculation methodology for the currency hedging or the Fund’s hedging transactions, if implemented, will be effective.</div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation
where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese
yen may not be fully</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>hedged to the extent indicated by the Hedge Ratio, as determined by the
indicators described in the Fund's principal investment strategies. In addition, the hedge is reset on a monthly basis and will not be adjusted during the month based on movement in the value of the component securities or currency. As a result, the
Underlying Index may be “over-hedged” or “under-hedged” between month-end rebalances. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may
remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the
Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity
exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the
U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy as calculated by MSCI. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy</div> </div>

<div>may also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences
between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Japanese yen may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Japanese yen depreciates against the U.S. dollar and the depreciation of one
currency is not offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Japanese yen is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against Japanese yen will reduce the value of
a security denominated in the Japanese yen. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the
Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend
to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and
negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system
breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized
Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the Japanese yen as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or
otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses
related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates,
interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs.
Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in
losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in Japan, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in Japan, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments in Japan.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Lack of Natural Resources

negative impact on Japanese securities, which could reduce the possibility of appreciation or a positive impact on the currency, which in turn could reduce the benefit of the currency hedge entered into by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the</font></div> </div>

<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO

number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade
a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to
</font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>communication errors, errors of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's
service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these
measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in
this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Japan<font>.</font><font> The Japanese economy may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability, which could have a negative impact on
Japanese securities. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. In addition, Japan is subject to the risk of natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, which could negatively affect the Fund or the Underlying Fund. Japan’s</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>relations with its neighbors have at times been strained, and strained
relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's
or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently
deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and
would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in
the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments
comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized
gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains.
In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or
decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or
administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between
a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of
uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of
capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual
market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and
redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in
the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying
Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the
timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the
securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as
a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to
purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or
higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be
impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing</font></div> </div>

<div>campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may
have an adverse impact on their profitability.</div> <div>Currency
Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions, if implemented, will be effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both
physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid
than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to
structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency
hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese
yen may not be fully hedged to the extent indicated by the Hedge Ratio, as determined by the indicators described in the Fund's principal investment strategies or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise.
Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly
basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is
implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the
Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity
exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may
involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate from the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility
of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy as calculated by MSCI. The effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Japanese yen may impact the effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked
by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
Japanese yen or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the Japanese yen depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Japanese yen is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
or partially hedged from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of
the Fund’s currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge its foreign currency exposure. Currency exchange
rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such
cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control
the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its
shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency or currencies being
hedged. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives
more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are
potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose
value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may
delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Japan is
located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as droughts, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis or volcanic eruptions, and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event
may adversely impact Japan's economy or business operations of companies in Japan, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider</font></div> </div>

<div>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index
Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for
a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to
such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors
will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund,
including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses (including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such
fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</div> <div>An investor
in the Fund may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio
securities.</div> <div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying
Fund changes from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Lack of Natural Resources Risk.
<font>Japan is an island state with few natural resources and limited land area and is reliant on imports for its commodity needs. Any fluctuations or shortages in the commodity markets could have a negative impact on the
Japanese economy.</font></div> <div>Large-Capitalization Companies
Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited
growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit
transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant
market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if
there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may
also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund
shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Model Risk.<font> Neither the Fund
nor BFA can offer assurances that the allocation and hedging model used to calculate the Underlying Index will achieve its intended results.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk.<font> The
Fund is classified as “non-diversified.” This means that the Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to the risks
associated with these particular issuers or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting these issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures and rising commodity prices. Japanese economic growth has generally been
dependent on the U.S. and Chinese economies, with trade increasing with China in recent years.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Japan.<font>
Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, and labor risks, among others. Any of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. The growth of
Japan's economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future.
The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected in the past by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners.
Japan is also heavily dependent on oil and other commodity imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the Japanese economy.</font></div>

Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political developments may lead to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>changes in policy that might adversely affect the Fund’s or the

Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</div>
<div>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk<font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations, a changing
corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>. The Japanese
yen has fluctuated widely at times, and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. The Japanese government has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce
the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</font></div>
<div>Nuclear Energy Risk.<font> The
nuclear power plant catastrophe in Japan in March 2011 may have long-term effects on the Japanese economy and its nuclear energy industry, the extent of which are currently unknown.</font></div>
<div>Labor Risk<font>. Japan has an aging
workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the
need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk. <font>Natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Japan's
relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has shown concern
over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy and the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's investments in
times of crisis.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative
pronouncements issued by the IRS.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error
Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected
securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between
which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its
investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may
result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the
Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of
each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is
a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Japan. As a result, economic conditions of Japan may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports,
new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Japan and, as a result, securities to which the Fund or the
Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security,
instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade
suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or
during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is
converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by
the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued
securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may
be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials
sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition
and/or rate regulation, which</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is
particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures
have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be
unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely
affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Telecommunications Sector Risk.<font>
The telecommunications sector of a country's economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new
regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices,
can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services
using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in
a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among
other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in foreign
currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations, inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index, based on MSCI’s calculation methodology. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to
brokers, dealers and financial institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div> </div>

<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus and in the Fund’s
SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to invest the Fund’s
assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund achieves its investment
objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund  and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Japan Index. The MSCI Japan Index is a servicemark of the Index Provider and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The Underlying
Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by the Index Provider and the Index Provider makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWJ, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWJ through December 31, 2020. The
contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund
operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>

subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in
securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions
with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in
other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The
Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest
in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase, or

Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or
more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies
and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result

share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise

<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Shareholder Information</div>
<div>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and
sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “DEWJ.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring
for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe BZX.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both
current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated
during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as
quoted by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is
calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities)
by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially
identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a
tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund
shares.</div> <div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term
capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains,
regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally
eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment
income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Japan.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund from a
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is
expected that dividends received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div> </div>

<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and
taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund or to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use
foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>

<div>block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each
“creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.

<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is

<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the

<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Australia ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization Australian equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Australia ETF (“EWA” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWA, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon
written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also
incur usual and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Australia ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate
for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Australia 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Australian Stock Exchange with the currency risk</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S.
dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials and materials
industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying
Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both
deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the Australian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. The
hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Australian dollar is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to
have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Australian dollar is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the Australian dollar. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a
specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the Australian dollar. While this approach is designed
to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the Australian dollar.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset
the actual fluctuations in value between the Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to
proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds
(“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging”</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward
contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying
Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in
the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in
an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Australian
dollar may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency
fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As
a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter
instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This
risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and
the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest
rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Australian dollar may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Australian dollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to
hedge currency exposure to the Australian dollar is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar will reduce the value of a
security denominated in the Australian dollar. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or
the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they
intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations,
potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such
plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or</font></div> </div>

<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the Australian dollar as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or
otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses
related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates,
interest rates and other economic</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose
value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and
may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and
performance of derivatives.</div> <div>Dividend Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will either remain at current
levels or increase over time.</font></div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of
common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the
bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations,
economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by
applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology
malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>

Fund's investments in Australia.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk.
<font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying

activity conducted by the Fund.</div> <div>As the Fund’s
allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>

<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO
NAV.</font></div> <div>Materials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, changes in exchange rates, depletion of resources,
over-production, litigation and changes in government regulations, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their
securities may be more volatile and less liquid.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>price for the underlying security
(<font>i.e</font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be
greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div> <div>Non-U.S.
Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as
heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Australian securities or Australian markets. In addition, non-U.S.
securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are
specifically exposed to </font><font>Australasian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading
may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, Australasian
Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Australia<font>.</font><font> Investments in Australian issuers may subject the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic
risk specific to Australia. The Australian economy is heavily dependent on exports from the energy, agricultural and mining sectors. This makes the Australian economy susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity markets. Australia is also dependent
on trading with key trading partners.</font></div> <div>Securities
Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the
loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any
investments made with cash</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund.</div> <div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently
deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss
carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher
magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment
of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes
from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of

<div>Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue
Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as
swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the
Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the
extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for
increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and
differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the
valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using</font></div> </div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Because the economies of Australasia are dependent on the economies of Asia, Europe and the U.S. as key trading partners and investors, reduction in spending by any of
these trading partners on Australasian products and services, or negative changes in any of these economies, may cause an adverse impact on some or all of the Australasian economies.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of</font></div> </div>

<div>those securities, may experience increased price volatility and may be more
susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Australian
dollar may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to
influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>There is no assurance that the Fund’s strategy will be
effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the
volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Australian dollar may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the
Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
Australian dollar or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the Australian dollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Australian dollar is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such
cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control
the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its
shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The
possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more
difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially
unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value.
Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or
restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials
sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition
and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience
technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively
impact the Fund.</div> <div>Geographic Risk.<font> Australia is located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes and droughts, and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely
impact Australia's economy or business operations of companies in Australia, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have
market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to

<div>correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any
transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the
risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error
risk of the Fund.</div> <div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying
Fund in tracking its benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div> </div>

<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>

<div>experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and
redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the
Fund may incur losses.</div> <div>Secondary market trading in Fund
or Underlying Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by
extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the Australian dollar hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit
transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant
market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if
there is a lack of an active market for such</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s
or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Materials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations,
over-production, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result
of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of
tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Australia.<font> Investment in Australian issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>specific to Australia. The Australian economy is heavily dependent on exports
from the energy, agricultural and mining sectors. As a result, the Australian economy is susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity markets. The Australian economy is also becoming increasingly dependent on its growing services industry. The
Australian economy is dependent on trading with key trading partners, including the U.S., China, Japan, Singapore and certain European countries. Reduction in spending on Australian products and services, or changes in any of the economies may cause
an adverse impact on the Australian economy.</div> <div>Securities
Lending Risk.<font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned
securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any
investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account
the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or
administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div> <div>Tracking
Error Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected
securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between
which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may
experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things,
differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency
forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency
forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div>
<div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is
a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Australia. As a result, economic conditions of Australia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or
exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Australia and, as a result, securities to which
the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons.
Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when
shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars
using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index,
which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive
fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by
technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy
supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances.
Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these
companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy
companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability
from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event
could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected
by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (<font>e.g.</font>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy
companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be
unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely
affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by
changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because
companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font>
The Fund may invest in companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), real estate holding and operating companies, or real estate management or
development companies, which expose investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general
and local economic conditions and developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk
and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate
Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund (and
indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such expenses.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>. Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high
volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>Equity
REITs Risk. <font>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These REITs are often referred to as “Equity REITs.” Equity REITs invest primarily in real properties and may earn rental income from
leasing those properties. Equity REITs may also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the properties they own. A decline in
rental income may occur because of extended vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising interest rates. Rising interest
rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase the costs of
obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>. Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in
increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</div>
<div>Leverage Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of
rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers and tenants.
Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk<font>. Investing in
Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that purchase
and sale transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability
to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition,
transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures in certain of its
properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts, changing
tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments and changes in tax law.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk<font>. Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage</font></div> </div>

<div>collection and other public services or environmental regulations also may
have a major impact on real estate income and values.</div>
<div>Repayment Risk.<font> The prices of
Real Estate Company securities may drop because of the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real Estate Companies invest do
not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of the Real
Estate Companies to make payments of interest and principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div> </div>

<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Australia Index. The “MSCI Australia Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The
Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>

<div>For its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a
management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating
expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWA, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWA, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be
terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding
Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Diane
Hsiung, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Orlando Montalvo and Greg Savage are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)) and their directors, officers and employees and of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which, through a
subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in
securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions
with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in
other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The
Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest
in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase, or
distribute or sell services</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the
Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or
more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies
and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result
in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and
sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HAUD.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring
for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both
current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated
during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as
quoted by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is
calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities)
by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially
identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a
tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund
shares.</div> <div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term
capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains,
regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally
eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment
income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Australia.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund
from a REIT or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the
Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div> </div>

<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and
taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator”

<div>authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered
into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div> </div>

<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>
<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

</td></tr></table> </div> <div>Investment Objective</div>
<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Canada ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization Canadian equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Canada ETF (“EWC” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWC, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written
agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also incur usual
and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Canada ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate for
the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 10% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Canada 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Toronto Stock Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S. dollar on a
monthly basis. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the energy and financials industries or
sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying
Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both
deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. The
hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Canadian dollar is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have
lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Canadian dollar is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the Canadian dollar. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified
amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the Canadian dollar. While this approach is designed to minimize
the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the Canadian dollar.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset
the actual fluctuations in value between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to
proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds
(“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging”</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward
contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying
Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in
the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in
an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Canadian
dollar may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency
fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As
a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter
instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This
risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the
U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates.
Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Canadian dollar may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Canadian dollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to
hedge currency exposure to the Canadian dollar is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Canadian dollar will reduce the value of a security denominated in the
Canadian dollar. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares.
Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations,
potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such
plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of
securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or
otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses
related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates,
interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and
increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund
(which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk.<font> The market value of securities in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among others, changes in energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and energy
conservation efforts.</font></div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of
common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the
bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations,
economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law.

<div>capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual
financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies
in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares,</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to ineffective currency
hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Canadian securities or Canadian markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and
may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading
may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, North American
Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Canada<font>.</font><font> Investments in Canadian issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risk specific
to Canada. Among other things, the Canadian economy is heavily dependent on relationships with certain key trading partners, including the U.S. and China.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>The Canadian economy is sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity
markets.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently
deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss
carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher
magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the
Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives
may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition,
certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative
pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the
Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other
things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the
currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally
valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as
a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to
purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or
higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be
impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will

<div>effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio
(directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A
lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a
situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Canadian
dollar may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to
influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the
Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of
the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Canadian dollar may impact the effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in
the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
Canadian dollar or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the Canadian dollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Canadian dollar is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>unauthorized access to digital systems
(<font>e.g.</font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also
be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber
security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and
administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations,
potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous
creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other
compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund
inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity
plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation
efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the
Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The
possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more
difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result</font></div> </div>

<div>of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited.
BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may
give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or restrict the
exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment;
and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit
the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a
material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or
other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a
risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's
portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to
restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials
sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition
and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience
technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively
impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the
Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the
Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not
guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA.
BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time
and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains
incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively</font></div> </div>

rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply,
labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also
cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the Canadian dollar hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit
transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange</font></div> </div>

<div>prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to timing
reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market
volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if there is a
lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

North American countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade arrangements among the
U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as
on the value of certain securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not
address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of

<div>economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on
the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Canada.<font>
The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading and investment partner, and the Canadian economy is significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total two-way
merchandise trade between the U.S. and Canada has significantly increased. Any downturn in U.S. or Mexican economic activity, which could result from the U.S. threatened exit from NAFTA, is likely to have an adverse impact on the Canadian economy.
The Canadian economy is also dependent upon external trade with other key trading partners, including China. In addition, Canada is a large supplier of natural resources (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, oil, natural gas and agricultural products). As a result, the Canadian economy is sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives,
such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition,
tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the
Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing
directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the
Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at
4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div> <div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Canada. As a result, economic conditions of Canada may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S.
economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Canada and,
as a result, securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other
asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other
reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when
shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars
using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index,
which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive
fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by
technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely
affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by
changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because
companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Canada Index. The “MSCI Canada Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The
Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWC, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWC, plus 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Diane
Hsiung, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Orlando Montalvo and Greg Savage are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not
limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of his or her portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his or
her portfolio management team that have more limited responsibilities.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)) and their directors, officers and employees and of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which, through a
subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in
securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions

or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund
also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and
purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make
brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives
similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end
investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and
these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have
interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>

restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>

<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See

Information</div> <div>Additional shareholder information, including
how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWC.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions
described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities
exchange.</div> <div>The national securities exchange on which the
Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday,
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both
current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or
other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the
IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price</div>

<div>quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the
security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative
trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a
material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Canada.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund from a
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is
expected that dividends received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences
under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about
the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is</div> </div>

<div>not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization equities from developed market countries which use the euro as their official currency while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between
the value of the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>Fees and
Expenses</div> <div>The following table describes the fees and
expenses that you will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and
Expenses are not included in the calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the
investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the
Fund’s investment in the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (“EZU” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EZU, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior
to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate
for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 11% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI EMU
100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”) as an equity benchmark for the European</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Economic and Monetary Union (the “EMU”) countries with the
currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. As of August 31, 2018, the Underlying Index consists of stocks from the following 10 developed market countries: Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by
securities of companies in the financials industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security
selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components
of the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency
forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value
of the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the euro in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge
is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar and appreciation in the euro does not exceed the aggregate
depreciation of the others. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the euro. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of
a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the euro. While
this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the euro. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the
actual fluctuations in value between the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI, which is independent
of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are
unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and
Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant
concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or
instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div> <div>Concentration
Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that
the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as
intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment
objective.</div> <div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do
not eliminate movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in
response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure
to the euro may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect
to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty
or small number of counterparties.</div> <div>The effectiveness of
the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both
of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the euro will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected
by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro will reduce the value of a security denominated in the euro. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could
affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments
in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change
quickly and without warning.</div> <div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service
providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact
the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging
counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the euro as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a
derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its
derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and
other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory
requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses),
remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset
classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of
preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this
sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific
geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>

<div>correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index
computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on
the Fund and its shareholders.</div> <div>Investment in Underlying
Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the
Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a
direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition
or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other
instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO

<div>companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and
their securities may be more volatile and less liquid.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and
may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and
communication errors, errors of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to
reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in
this trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic
Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic
and other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed

<div>experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international
relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments. In addition, developed countries may be
adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Europe<font>.</font><font> The Fund is more exposed to the economic and political risks of Europe and of the European countries in which it invests than funds whose investments
are more geographically diversified. Adverse economic and political events in Europe may cause the Fund’s investments to decline in value. The economies and markets of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and
events in one country in Europe can have an adverse impact on other European countries. The Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have significant operations in, member states of the European Union (the
“EU”) that are subject to economic and monetary controls that can adversely affect the Fund’s investments. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years and these events have
adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect other European countries.  In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU. The referendum may
introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Risk of Investing in France. <font>The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in French issuers subjects the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to
France. Recently, new concerns emerged with respect to the economic outlook for certain EU countries, including France. External demand for French exports is expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K.'s resolution to leave the EU. As a result,
the French economy may experience adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn, potential weakness in exports, high rates of unemployment and rising government debt levels. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement
in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the French economy. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports, and as a result, is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products.
France has experienced several terrorist attacks over the past several years, creating a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Germany. <font>The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments in German issuers may subject the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks
specific to Germany. Recently, new concerns have emerged in relation to the economic health of the EU, which have led to downward pressure on the earnings of certain financial institutions, including German financial services companies. Secessionist

<div>Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the German economy. Germany has an
export dependent economy and therefore relies heavily on trade with key trading partners, including the Netherlands, China, the U.S., the U.K., France, Italy and other European countries. Germany is dependent on the economies of these other
countries, and any change in the price or demand for German exports may have an adverse impact on its economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund and the Underlying Fund invest have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's
or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if
any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for
lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable
as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a
larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of
certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through</font></div> </div>

error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of
the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the
close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on
an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face
trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that</font></div> </div>

<div>are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues
and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may
not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to influence
foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency
fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions
may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or
liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single
counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate from
the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying
Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency
hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund
when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
euro or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the Fund’s
attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities comprising the Underlying
Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a
geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the value of the underlying
currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged from a currency
perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and
regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency
exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such
cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control
the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized
Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The
possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more
difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially
unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value.
Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or
restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The EU
requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries
that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU
member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced
volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries,
including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European
countries.</div> <div>Responses to financial problems by European
governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further
defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or
withdraw from the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit
from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the
potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and
could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K.
and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political,
economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been
in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial
uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>

<div>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital
they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have
significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks.
While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials
sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of
investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be
adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be
subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for
cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in
this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Some of the
companies in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, and
are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the
Fund.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the
Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the
Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not
guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA.
BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time
and may not</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at
all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and
would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the
Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div> </div>

<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution.
Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices
in such markets being less efficient.</div> <div>Secondary Market
Trading Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares
may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a
time when the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit transactions. If the

<div>elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more
likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close
to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and
redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ
significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the
Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying</font></div> </div>

Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations
caused by economic and political developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>

<div>trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of their key trading
partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such countries or regions and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund or the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary
means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in
other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes,
historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund or
the Underlying Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of
recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed
country economies.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Europe. <font>The Fund is more exposed to the economic and political risks of Europe and of the European countries in which it invests than are funds whose investments are more geographically diversified. Adverse economic and
political events in Europe may cause the Fund’s investments to decline in value. The economies and markets of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one country in Europe can have an adverse impact on
other European countries. The Fund and Underlying Fund make investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have significant operations in, member states of the EU. The EU requires compliance by member states with restrictions on
inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or
exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, or an economic
recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years due to concerns
about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the
exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect other European countries. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and</font></div> </div>

<div>reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and
may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset
valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching.
In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (Brexit). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of
negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and
consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to
instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and
the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal
consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and
investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks
to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div> <div>Certain
European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the
Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe
also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value of the Fund. The Fund’s investments could be negatively impacted by any economic or
political instability in any European country.</div> <div>Risk of
Investing in France.<font> Investment in French issuers subjects the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to France. Recently, new concerns
emerged in relation to the economic health of the EU. These concerns have led to downward pressure on certain EU member states, including France. Interest rates on France’s debt may rise to levels that make it difficult for it to service high
debt levels without significant financial help from, among others, the European Central Bank and could potentially result in default. In addition, the French economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of certain</font></div>

External demand for French exports is expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K.'s resolution to leave the EU. Reduction in spending on French products and services, or changes in any of the economies may cause an adverse impact on the French
economy. In addition, France has been subject to acts of terrorism, which has created a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism and may lead to further adverse economic consequences. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan
movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the French economy. The French economy is dependent on exports from the agricultural sector. Leading agricultural exports include dairy products, meat, wine,
fruit and vegetables, and fish. As a result, the French economy is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Germany.<font>
Investment in German issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to Germany. Recently, new concerns have emerged in relation to the economic health of the
EU. These concerns have led to downward pressure on the earnings of certain financial institutions, including German financial services companies. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the German economy. The German economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of certain key trading partners, including the Netherlands, China, the U.S., the U.K., France, Italy and other
European countries. Reduction in spending on German products and services, or changes in any of the economies may have an adverse impact on the German economy. In addition, heavy regulation of labor, energy and product markets in Germany may have an
adverse impact on German issuers. Such regulations may negatively impact economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic
areas in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may
cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies and the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk.<font> Certain
political, economic, legal and currency risks could contribute to a high degree of price volatility in the equity markets of some of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest and could adversely affect</font></div> </div>

<div>investments in the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Political and Social Risk<font>.
Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying
Fund may invest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses.</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. Some countries
in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest may experience economic instability, including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or significant devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a
negative effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available
currency hedging instruments.</font></div> <div>Expropriation Risk<font>. Investments in certain countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign
investments and repatriation of capital.</font></div> <div>Large
Government Debt Risk<font>. Chronic structural public sector deficits in some countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the Fund or the Underlying
Fund.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk.<font>
Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the
Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the
Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund
were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset.
Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may
be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or
decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or
administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable,
differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the
Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the
distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or
other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations
and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments
in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying
Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the
Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market
close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is
a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, certain country or countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be particularly
affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the
economic conditions of such countries and, as a result, securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because
non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing
market rates on the date of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may
result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.
Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued
securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment;
and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit
the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a
material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or
other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a
risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's
portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to
restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</font></div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may

<div>unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and
may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</div> <div>Industrials
Sector Risk.<font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector
products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange
rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be
adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending
policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely
affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font>

<div>companies to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their
traditional lines of business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these companies to greater risk of loss.
Companies in the utilities industry may have difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; face restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to increased costs because
of the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made or natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control utility
revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no
assurance that regulatory authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks issued by a utility company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may
also have a significant adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div> </div>

<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI EMU Index, which consists of stocks from the following 10 developed market countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain. The “MSCI EMU Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no
representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EZU, after taking into account any fee waivers by EZU, plus 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)) and their directors, officers and employees and of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which, through a
subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in
securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions
with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in

<div>or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the
Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or
more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies
and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result
in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See

<div>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and
sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEZU.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring
for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both
current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated
during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for

<div>into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as
quoted by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is
calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities)
by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially
identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a
tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund
shares.</div> <div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term
capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains,
regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally
eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment
income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends
received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div> </div>

<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and
taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>

into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in

securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div> </div>

<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>
<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Germany ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization German equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through December 31, 2020. The
contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
underlying fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Germany ETF (the “Underlying Fund”), may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios).
A higher portfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating
Expenses or in the Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 11% of the
average value of its portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Germany 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Frankfurt Stock</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the
Underlying Index hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies
in the consumer discretionary industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio</div> </div>

<div>turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying
Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S.
dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of
the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the euro in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset
on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an
equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the euro. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of
a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the euro. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of
currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the euro. The return of the foreign currency</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value
between the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>The Fund may also
use non-deliverable forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the
contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are
unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and
Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant
concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable income, consumer preferences,
social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div> <div>Currency
Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset
by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can
be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than
deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure
its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to
implement its investment objective.</div> <div>Currency forward
contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change
quickly and unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other
reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the
Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions
as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as
well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with
a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences
between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro will reduce the value of a security denominated in the euro. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could
affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments
in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a
result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>

makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations,
potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such
plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of
securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or
result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards,
like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that
the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the euro as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying
Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could
also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency
exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and
increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund
(which</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may
otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market
downturns.</div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in
secondary markets, losses due to ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT
A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market
Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange
on which the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The

<div>securities or German markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets
may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically
exposed to <font>European Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading
may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Risk of Investing in Germany. <font>The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments in German issuers subjects the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific
to Germany. Recently, new concerns have emerged in relation to the economic health of the European Union (the “EU”), which have led to downward pressure on the earnings of certain financial institutions, including German financial
services companies. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the German economy. Germany has an export dependent economy and therefore relies heavily on
trade with key trading partners, including the Netherlands, China, the U.S., the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), France, Italy and other European countries. Germany is dependent on the economies of these other countries, and any change in
the price or demand for German exports may have an adverse impact on its economy.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if
any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for
lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable
as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a
larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of
certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through</font></div> </div>

<div>investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking
error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of
the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the
close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency
forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem
Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued
securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div>

<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on
an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face
trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that</font></div> </div>

<div>are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues
and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may
not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt
policies designed to influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to
hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or
its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty
risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund
trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s
return to deviate from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no
assurance that the Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of
both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of
the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked
by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
euro or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the Fund’s
attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities comprising the Underlying
Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange
rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s
investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a
fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to
hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to
hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or</font></div> </div>

<div>inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or the
Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are
inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans
and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively
impacted as a result.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging
strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk,
which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly
with the currency being hedged. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and
could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements,
which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives
positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more
costly, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>

<div>and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in
Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default
or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets
have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,
Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The
outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty
and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to
instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and
the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal
consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and
investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks
to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div> <div>Secessionist
movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics
of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political</div> </div>

<div>unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in
sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the
value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have
market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund
invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the
Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses (including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due</font></div> </div>

downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed

<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the euro hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit transactions. If
the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant
market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if
there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>

<div>Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments
included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> Exports account for more than one-third of national output and are a key element in German macroeconomic expansion. The German economy is dependent on the economies of Europe and the U.S. Reduction in spending by these
economies on German products and services or negative changes in any of these economies may cause an adverse impact on the German economy and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Germany.<font>
Investment in German issuers subjects the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to Germany. Recently, new concerns have emerged in relation to the economic health of the
EU. These concerns have led to downward pressure on the earnings of certain financial institutions, including German financial services companies. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the German economy. The German economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of certain key trading partners, including the Netherlands, China, the U.S., the U.K., France, Italy and other
European countries. Reduction in spending on German products and services, or changes in any of the economies may have an adverse impact on the German economy. In addition, heavy regulation of labor, energy and product markets in Germany may have an
adverse impact on German issuers. Such regulations may negatively impact economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an</font></div> </div>

<div>underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized
gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains.
In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund.
Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition,
tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the
Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing
directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the
Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at
4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div> <div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Germany. As a result, economic conditions of Germany may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S.
economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material</font></div> </div>

<div>adverse effect on the economic conditions of Germany and, as a result,
securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because
non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing
market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could
result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares,
or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors
by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div> </div>

<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials
sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition
and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience
technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively
impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses,
rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the
healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration
of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces
that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such
efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The

<div>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The
products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect
the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by
changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because
companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely
affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities
may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the
risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Germany Index. The “MSCI Germany Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The
Underlying Fund is not sponsored,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation
regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.53%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount
equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon
written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such
voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

with and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the
Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt
or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the
sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have
business relationships with, and purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such
services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that
have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other
open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading
activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or
junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised
or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> <div>Shareholder

how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWG.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has
little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly
launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NASDAQ.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized
portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is
based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other
assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed
only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund.
The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation
or warranty as to its accuracy.</div> <div>Determination of Net Asset
Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE
is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of
valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the
Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the
Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div> </div>

<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities
markets may be fair valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good
faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that
liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by
the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a
corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax treaty with Germany.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are
qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment trust and
distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes

an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income

<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>

Fund shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were
paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax
mentioned above.</div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some
of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,

<div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the
Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any securities used
to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified
institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Italy ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization Italian equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the
iShares MSCI Italy ETF (“EWI” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWI, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon
written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written
agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also incur usual
and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Italy ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate for
the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 11% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Italy 25/50 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Milan Stock Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S.
dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight,
and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is
represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary, energy and</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>financials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are
likely to change over time.</div> <div>Currently, the Fund achieves
its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying
Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both
deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the euro in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset
on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is weakening relative to the U.S.
dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the euro. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of
a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the euro. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of
currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the euro. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the euro and the
U.S. dollar.</div> <div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable
forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon
exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>“MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index
Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)

facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There<font> </font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund
would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>

social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div> <div>Currency
Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset
by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can
be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of

objective.</div> <div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do
not eliminate movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in
response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure
to the euro may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect
to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty
or small number of counterparties.</div> <div>The effectiveness of
the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both
of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the euro will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected
by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro will reduce the value of a security denominated in the euro. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could
affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments
in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and</font></div> </div> <div>

<div>can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change
quickly and without warning.</div> <div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service
providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact
the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging
counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the euro as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a
derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its
derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and
other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory
requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses),
remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>

<div>decline for many reasons, including, among others, changes in energy prices,
energy supply and demand, government regulations and energy conservation efforts.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this
sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in Italy, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in Italy, causing an adverse impact on the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in Italy.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE</font></div> </div>

<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their
securities may be more volatile and less liquid.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Italian securities or Italian markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may
be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading
may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Italy<font>.</font><font> The Fund’s investments in Italian issuers subjects the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency and economic
risks specific to Italy. Among other things, Italy’s economy has been characterized by slow growth over the past few decades due to factors such as</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>a high tax rate, rigid labor market and a generous pension system. Recently,
the Italian government has experienced significant budget deficits and a high amount of public debt, causing credit agencies to lower Italy’s sovereign debt rating. The Italian economy is also heavily dependent on trade with other European
countries. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the Italian economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently

<div>Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards,
if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund
shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The
federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount
of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or
straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income
from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”).</div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur
because of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying
Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the
valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and
the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange
markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its
currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error
as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in</div> </div>

<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or
redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater
settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may
change quickly and unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other
reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence
prices and may adopt policies designed to influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the
Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions
as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is
subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the
extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause
the Fund’s return to deviate from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>There is no assurance that the Fund’s strategy will be
effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the
U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be
affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the
currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates
against the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>Investors, such as the Fund,
seeking to trade in foreign currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market
liquidity. These limitations and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into
contracts to purchase or sell the euro or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under
“Derivatives Risk.”</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the Fund’s
attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities comprising the Underlying
Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a
geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the value of the underlying
currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged from a currency
perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging
transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change
quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption
orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or
additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or
inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the
event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will
not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers
or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The
possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more
difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially
unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value.
Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or
restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy
sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and
contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental
entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less
developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other
environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and
could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products
(<font>e.g.</font>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt
and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country
in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the
default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial
markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K.
negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks
associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or
market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new
relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the
Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may
be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political,
regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the
U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk
taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with
substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse
conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to
fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly
frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Italy is
located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, flooding and volcanic eruptions, and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact Italy's economy or
business operations of companies in Italy, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have
market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by
the Fund and its shareholders.</div> <div>Apart from scheduled
rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund
in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund
and its shareholders. Unscheduled rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad
hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of
distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides,
invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such
markets being less efficient.</div> <div>Secondary Market Trading
Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may
trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time
when the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the euro hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit transactions. If
the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations
and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that
differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute
to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of
tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Italy.<font> Investment in Italian issuers subjects the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, and economic risks specific to Italy. Italy’s economy is dependent upon external trade with
other economies,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>specifically Germany, France, other Western European developed countries and
the U.S. As a result, Italy is dependent on the economies of these other countries and any change in the price or demand for Italy’s exports may have an adverse impact on its economy. Recently, the Italian economy, along with certain other
European economies, has experienced significant volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturn, political instability and rising government debt levels. Interest rates on Italy's debt may rise to levels that may make it
difficult for it to service high debt levels without significant financial help from the EU and could potentially lead to default. These events have adversely impacted the Italian economy, causing credit agencies to lower Italy’s sovereign
debt rating and could decrease outside investment in Italian companies. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the Italian economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives,
such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition,
tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the
Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing
directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the
Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at
4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div> <div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security,
instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade
suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or
during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in
non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV
and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is
holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to
value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies</font></div>

<div>in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for
their products and services.</div> <div>Threshold/Underinvestment
Risk.<font> If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on
behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain
securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may
increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font>
Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater competition and may adversely affect their profitability. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of
business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities
industry may have difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; face restrictions on operations and increased cost and
delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels
or the effects of man-made or natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore
may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that regulatory
authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks issued by a utility company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a significant
adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</font></div>

<div>allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as
determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio
securities to brokers, dealers and financial institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Italy 25/50 Index. The “MSCI Italy 25/50 Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The
Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>

<div>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management
affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many
disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWI, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWI, plus 0.03% through December
31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Diane
Hsiung, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Orlando Montalvo and Greg Savage are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not

or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund
also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and
purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make
brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives
similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end
investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and
these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have
interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>

<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their

Information</div> <div>Additional shareholder information, including
how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWI.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions
described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities
exchange.</div> <div>The national securities exchange on which the
Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday,
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both
current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or
other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the
IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price</div>

<div>quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the
security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative
trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a
material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Italy.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund from a
RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment
trust and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences
under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about
the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is</div> </div>

<div>not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization Japanese equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through December 31, 2020,
provided that the waiver be no greater than the Fund's management fee of 0.53%. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its
management fees by an additional amount such that the Fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver will be equal to the greater of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses or 0.48% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be
terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
underlying fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (the “Underlying Fund”), may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A
higher portfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating
Expenses or in the Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 9% of the
average value of its portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Japan 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S. dollar
on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary and
industrials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the
component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts,
cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of
the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward
contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value
of the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly
basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Japanese yen is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an
equivalent unhedged investment when the Japanese yen is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese yen. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified
amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the Japanese yen. While this approach is designed to minimize
the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese yen. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value
between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>The Fund
may also use non-deliverable forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the
contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to
proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds
(“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable income, consumer preferences,
social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div> <div>Currency
Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset
by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate
gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation
where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese yen may not be
fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it
is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not
successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging
transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of
counterparties.</div> <div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the
Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected
by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Japanese yen may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Japanese yen depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency exposure to the Japanese yen is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen will reduce the value of a security denominated in the Japanese yen. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange
rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can
change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations,
potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,</font></div> </div>

<div>there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the
Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the
Underlying Fund invests.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the Japanese yen as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise
close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related
to its</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which
losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives
positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of
derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect
the value and performance of derivatives.</div> <div>Equity Securities
Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is
comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities
upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in Japan, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in Japan, causing an adverse impact on
the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in Japan.</font></div>

<div>results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying
Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying
Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all,
which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses
borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure.
Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Lack of Natural Resources
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and Underlying Fund invest in Japan, which has few natural resources. Any fluctuation or shortage in the commodity markets could have a
negative impact on Japanese securities, which could reduce the possibility of appreciation or a positive impact on the currency, which in turn could reduce the benefit of the currency hedge entered into by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>

<div>short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods
during more prolonged market downturns.</div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in
secondary markets, losses due to ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT
A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization
Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and
their securities may be more volatile and less liquid.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Japanese securities or Japanese markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and
may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>

<div>heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this
trading may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to <font>Asian Economic Risk</font> and <font>U.S. Economic Risk</font>.</div> <div>Risk
of Investing in Japan<font>.</font><font> The Japanese economy may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability, which could have a negative
impact on Japanese securities. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. In addition, Japan is subject to the risk of natural disasters, such
as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, which could negatively affect the Fund or the Underlying Fund. Japan’s relations with its neighbors have at times been strained, and strained relations may cause uncertainty in
the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> The geographic area in which the Fund and the Underlying Fund invest has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or
region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if
any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for
lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable
as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a
larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the</font></div> </div>

<div>Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue
Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as
swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the
Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the
extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for
increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and
differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the
valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on
an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face
trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve
greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging
transactions will be effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge
the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to
post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek
to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese
yen may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to
influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the
Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Japanese yen may impact the effectiveness of the
Fund’s</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by
the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
Japanese yen or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the Japanese yen depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Japanese yen is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining
unauthorized access to digital systems (<font>e.g.</font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network
services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund
accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause
disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading,
submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties,
reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the
functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the
Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not
been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index
Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The
possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more
difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions
as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors,
which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the
use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Japan is
located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as droughts, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis or volcanic eruptions, and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event
may adversely impact Japan's economy or business operations of companies in Japan, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have
market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by
the Fund and its shareholders.</div> <div>Apart from scheduled
rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund
in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund
and its shareholders. Unscheduled rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad
hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div> </div>

<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Lack of Natural Resources Risk.
<font>Japan is an island state with few natural resources and limited land area and is reliant on imports for its commodity needs. Any fluctuations or shortages in the commodity markets could have a negative impact on the
Japanese economy.</font></div> <div>Large-Capitalization Companies
Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited
growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading
prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. <font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not
likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to
attempt to mitigate the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the Japanese yen hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through
Creation Unit transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more
likely that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the
NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of
significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund
shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by
large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be
less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and
are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

<div>these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these
measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures and rising commodity prices. Japanese economic growth has generally been
dependent on the U.S. and Chinese economies, with trade increasing with China in recent years.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Japan.<font>
Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, and labor risks, among others. Any of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. The growth of
Japan's economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future.
The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected in the past by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners.
Japan is also heavily dependent on oil and other commodity imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Political Risk<font>. Historically,
Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments. In
addition, China has become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan's political relationship with China, however, is strained and delicate. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the
region as a whole.</font></div> <div>Large Government and Corporate
Debt Risk<font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations,
a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>. The Japanese
yen has fluctuated widely at times, and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. The Japanese government has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce
the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</font></div> </div>

<div>Nuclear Energy Risk.<font> The
nuclear power plant catastrophe in Japan in March 2011 may have long-term effects on the Japanese economy and its nuclear energy industry, the extent of which are currently unknown.</font></div>
<div>Labor Risk<font>. Japan has an aging
workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the
need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk. <font>Natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Japan's
relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has shown concern
over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy and the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's investments in
times of crisis.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of
short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not
offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital
gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct
investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of
the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable,
there could be an increase (or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from
swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition,
tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the
Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing
directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the
Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at
4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div> <div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Japan. As a result, economic conditions of Japan may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S.
economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Japan and,
as a result, securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued
using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of
assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to
calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares
on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital
they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have
significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks.
While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials
sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of
investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be
adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be
subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for
cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in
this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be
unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>personnel. The products of information technology companies may face
obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily
dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Telecommunications Sector Risk.<font>
The telecommunications sector of a country's economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new
regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable.
Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological
innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and
franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to
consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Japan Index. The “MSCI Japan Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The Underlying
Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are</div> </div> <div type="Block">

instruments that are not included in its underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.53%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount
equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through December 31, 2020, provided that the waiver be no greater than the Fund's management fee of 0.53%.
The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount such that the Fund's total annual fund operating
expenses after fee waiver will be equal to the greater of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses or 0.48% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In
addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be
eliminated by BFA at any time.</div> <div>BFA is located at 400
Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44
trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities,
derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with
respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances
(such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in
other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase, or distribute or sell services or products
from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection
with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and
compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies
that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference
to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are
owned by the Fund.</div> <div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is
under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may
differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary
or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into
transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or
Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> <div>Shareholder
Information</div> <div>Additional shareholder information, including
how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWJ.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or
smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by
market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the
precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a
“real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may
trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the
calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not
readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer
appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or
closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities,
that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or
highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair
valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation
of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an
arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during
the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying
Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on

<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a
corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax treaty with Japan.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends
received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you</div> </div>

or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or,
subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div> </div>

<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be
executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</div>
<div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the
Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any securities used
to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified
institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are</font></div> </div>

maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Mexico ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large-, mid- and small-capitalization Mexican equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Mexico ETF (“EWW” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWW, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written
agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also incur usual
and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate for
the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Mexico IMI 25/50 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Mexican Stock Exchange with the currency risk</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S.
dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight,
and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying Index may include large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying
Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer staples, financials and telecommunications industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> </div>

<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities
not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable)
designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the
equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge
is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Mexican peso is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower
returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Mexican peso is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the Mexican peso. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified
amount of a specific currency in the</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign
currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the Mexican peso. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s
exposure to the Mexican peso. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S.
government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation
where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Mexican
peso may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency
fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions
may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the
hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of
counterparties.</div> <div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican peso, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the
Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican peso will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates.
Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Mexican peso may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Mexican peso depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency exposure to the Mexican peso is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso will reduce the value of a security denominated in the Mexican peso. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange
rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can
change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and
depositories.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser,</font></div> </div>

<div>distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations,
potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such
plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of
securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the
Mexican peso as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the
Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of
unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could
cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more
costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the
Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally

<div>stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred
stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this
sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in Mexico, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in Mexico, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments in Mexico.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the
construction</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time
to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>

<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO
NAV.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>.,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign
market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Mexican securities or Mexican markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may
be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>

an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>North American Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in emerging market issuers may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or
operating in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and
reporting requirements, less reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated with custody of securities than developed markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Mexico<font>.</font><font> Investments in Mexican issuers involve risks that are specific to Mexico, including legal, regulatory, political, currency, security and economic
risks. In the past, Mexico has experienced high interest rates, economic volatility and high unemployment rates. Recent political developments in the U.S. have</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>potential implications for the current trade arrangements between the U.S. and
Mexico, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund and the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> The geographic area in which the Fund and the Underlying Fund invest has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or
region's security may cause uncertainty in Mexican markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently

Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may
result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The
Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect
the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are
subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable
dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Telecommunications Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the telecommunications sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital</font></div> </div>

products and services due to technological advancement.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment
objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from
investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the
Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the
Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time). INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be</font></div> </div>

<div>influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe
competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Mexican
peso may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to
influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the
volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican peso, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.
The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Mexican peso may impact the
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or
in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
Mexican peso or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the Mexican peso depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Mexican peso is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>

<div>prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to complete and
settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities and other assets in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local
markets. In general, the less developed a country’s financial markets are, the greater the likelihood of custody problems.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such
cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control
the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized
Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in
the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The
possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more
difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially
unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value.
Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or
restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by
affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a
whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial
leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related
markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest
rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and
have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> Mexico is
located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought, hurricanes or tsunamis and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Mexico has recently been affected
by substantial earthquakes as well as a hurricane. Any such event may adversely impact Mexico's economy or business operations of companies in Mexico, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have
market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by
the Fund and its shareholders.</div> <div>Apart from scheduled
rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund
in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund
and its shareholders. Unscheduled rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad
hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of
distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides,
invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such
markets being less efficient.</div> <div>Secondary Market Trading
Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may
trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time
when the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the Mexican peso hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit
transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations
and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that
differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute
to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

North American countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade arrangements among the
U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as
on the value of certain securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not
address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk. <font>Mexico has
privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly
privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to
re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of
tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.<font> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater
market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found
in more developed markets. Moreover, emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. In
addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large
amounts of foreign trade and investment. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of
holdings difficult or impossible at times. Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, significant delays may occur in certain
markets in registering the transfer of securities. Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to miss
attractive investment opportunities.</font></div> <div>Investing in
emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain emerging
market countries.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in Mexico.<font> Investment in Mexican issuers will subject the Fund or Underlying Fund to risks that are specific to Mexico, including regulatory, political, and economic risks. The Mexican economy is dependent upon external trade with
other economies, specifically with the U.S. and certain Latin American countries. As a result, Mexico is dependent on, among other things, the U.S. economy and any change in the price or demand for Mexican exports may have an adverse impact on
the Mexican economy. For example, lower oil prices have negatively impacted Petróleos Mexicanos, the Mexican State-owned petroleum company, which accounts for a significant percentage of the Mexican government's tax revenue. Recently, Mexico
has experienced adverse economic impacts as a result of earthquakes and hurricanes, as well as outbreaks of violence. Incidents involving Mexico’s security may have an</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>adverse effect on the Mexican economy and cause uncertainty in its financial
markets. In the past, Mexico has experienced high interest rates, economic volatility and high unemployment rates.</div>
<div>Political and Social Risk.<font>
Mexico has been destabilized by local insurrections, social upheavals, drug related violence, and the public health crisis related to the H1N1 influenza outbreak. Recurrence of these or similar conditions may adversely impact the Mexican economy.
Recently, Mexican elections have been contentious and have been very closely decided. Changes in political parties or other Mexican political events may affect the economy and cause instability.</font></div>
<div>Currency Instability Risk.<font>
Historically, Mexico has experienced substantial economic instability resulting from, among other things, periods of very high inflation and significant devaluations of the Mexican currency, the peso.</font></div>
<div>Relations with the U.S<font>. Recent
political developments in the U.S. have raised potential implications for the current trade arrangements between the U.S. and Mexico, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund and the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Mexico has
historically experienced acts of terrorism, significant criminal activity and strained international relations related to border disputes; historical animosities; the drug trade; defense concerns; and other security concerns. Recently, criminal gang
activity related to the drug trade has been on the rise. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Mexican market and adversely affect the performance of the Mexican economy.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if</font></div> </div>

<div>any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is
caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the
securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce
taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary
income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of
taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements
issued by the IRS.</div> <div>Telecommunications Sector Risk.<font> The telecommunications sector of a country's economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals,
or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and
unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology.
Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location.
Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors,
have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the
affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods
between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund
may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things,
differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency
forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency
forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time). INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT
TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div> <div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security,
instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade
suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or
during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is
converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by
the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued
securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may
be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation</font></div>

<div>and government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials
sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font>
The Fund may invest in companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), real estate holding and operating companies, or real estate management or
development companies, which expose investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general
and local economic conditions and developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk
and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate
Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund (and
indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such expenses.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>. Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high
volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>Equity
REITs Risk. <font>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These REITs are often referred to as “Equity REITs.” Equity REITs invest primarily in real properties and may earn rental income from
leasing those properties. Equity REITs may also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the properties they own. A decline in
rental income may occur because of extended vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising interest rates. Rising interest
rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates
also increase the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>. Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of
rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers and tenants.
Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk<font>. Investing in
Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that purchase
and sale transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability
to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition,
transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures in certain of its
properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk<font>. Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts, changing
tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic
developments and changes in tax law.</div> <div>Regulatory Risk<font>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, reduced funding for schools, parks,
garbage collection and other public services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate income and values.</font></div>
<div>Repayment Risk.<font> The prices of
Real Estate Company securities may drop because of the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real Estate Companies invest do
not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of the Real
Estate Companies to make payments of interest and principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the Fund's share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their
assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of mid- or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments.
Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more
established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse
product lines than those of mid- or large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Mexico Investable Market Index (IMI) 25/50. The “MSCI Mexico Investable Market Index (IMI) 25/50” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use
for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable</div> </div> <div type="Block">

securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWW, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWW, plus 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Diane

<div>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is
likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to
perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking
relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is
compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the
future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in
transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or
Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other
instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or
an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The

may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise

<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWW.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition
of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time”
update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio
securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or
dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not
readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer
appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or
closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities,
that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or
highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair
valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation
of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an
arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during
the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying
Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font>
No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial
owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available
and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Mexico.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends received by the Fund from a REIT or another RIC
generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a REIT and
distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.

disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your

withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to

<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div> </div>

<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the

<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Householding.<font> Householding is
an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the

<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>
<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI South Korea ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization South Korean equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the South Korean won and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the
iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (“EWY” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWY, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only
upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon
written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also
incur usual and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover
rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example
(except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 11% of the average value of its portfolio. To
the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Korea 25/50 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Stock Market Division of the Korea Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying
Index hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the
Underlying Index weight, and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of
the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the information technology and technology</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to
change over time.</div> <div>Currently, the Fund achieves its
investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying
Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both
deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the South Korean won in relation to the U.S. dollar. The
hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the South Korean
won is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the South Korean won is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the South Korean won. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a
specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the South Korean won. While this approach is designed
to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the South Korean won. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual
fluctuations in value between the South Korean won and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s
investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class.</div> <div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation

investment objective.</div> <div>Currency forward contracts,
including NDFs, do not eliminate movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and
unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the
Fund’s exposure to the South Korean won may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund
is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as
anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or
liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single
counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div> <div>The

<div>Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the South
Korean won, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the South Korean won will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.
The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the South Korean won
may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the South Korean won depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to
hedge currency exposure to the South Korean won is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the South Korean won will reduce the value of a security denominated in the South Korean won. In addition, fluctuations
in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s
or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely than more developed securities markets to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local
banks, agents and depositories.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service
providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact
the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging
counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or

<div>hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security,
a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not
fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the South Korean won as compared to that of the
U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and
could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses
are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to
lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives,
and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may</div> </div> <div>

<div>otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in South Korea, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in South Korea, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's or the Underlying
Fund's investments in South Korea.</font></div> <div>Index-Related
Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the
construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely
affected by the loss or impairment of those rights.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>companies. During different market cycles, the performance of
large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO

may be more volatile and less liquid.</font></div> <div>National
Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the
securities exchange on which the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an
underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (<font>i.e</font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or
discounts to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of South Korean securities or South Korean markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of
securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> The country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be
re-nationalized.</font></div> <div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in emerging market issuers may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or
operating in more developed markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and
reporting requirements, less reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated with custody of securities than developed markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in South
Korea<font>.</font><font> Investments in South Korean issuers may subject the Fund  and the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and
economic risks that are specific to South Korea. In addition, economic and political developments of South Korea’s neighbors, including escalated tensions involving North Korea and any outbreak of hostilities involving North Korea, or even the
threat of an outbreak of hostilities, may have a severe adverse effect on the South Korean economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> The geographic area in which the Fund and the Underlying Fund invest has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or
region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if
any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for
lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable
as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a
larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of
certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Technology Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition and
potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund
incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its
hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of
the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the
index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”),
typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally
valued at 4:00 p.m., London time). INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as
a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to
purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or
higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be
impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing

underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will

<div>effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio
(directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A
lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a
situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the South
Korean won may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed
to influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the South Korean won against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the
Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the South Korean won, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of
the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the South Korean won may impact the effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in
the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
South Korean won or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the South Korean won depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the South Korean won is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk.<font> Custody risk
refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities and other assets (such as currencies) by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less
developed markets may make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities and other assets in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local
agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets. In general, the less developed a country’s financial markets are, the greater the likelihood of custody problems.</font></div>

<div>providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational,
information security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which
could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying
Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (<font>e.g.</font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be
carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber
security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and
administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations,
potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous
creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other
compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund
inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity
plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation
efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the
Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses
deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the
characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject
to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not
correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the
Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated
market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the
Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives
may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk.<font> South Korea is
located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes or tsunamis, and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact South Korea's economy or
business operations of companies in South Korea, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not</font></div> </div>

<div>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at
all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and
would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the
Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely
affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>

portfolio securities.</div> <div>As the Fund's allocation to the
Underlying Fund changes from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading
prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. <font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S
SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not
likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to
attempt to mitigate the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the South Korean won hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares
through Creation Unit transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it
more likely that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly
with the NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during
periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or
Underlying Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by
large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be
less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and
are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

<div>these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these
measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk. <font>South Korea
has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in
newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization of such
privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of
tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.<font> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater
market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found
in more developed markets. Moreover, emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. In
addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large
amounts of foreign trade and investment. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of
holdings difficult or impossible at times. Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, significant delays may occur in certain
markets in registering the transfer of securities. Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to miss
attractive investment opportunities.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk
of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain emerging market countries.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in South Korea.<font> Investments in South Korean issuers involve risks that are specific to South Korea, including legal, regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risks. Substantial political tensions exist between North Korea
and South Korea. Escalated tensions involving the two nations and the outbreak of hostilities between the two nations, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the South Korean economy. In addition,
South Korea's economic growth potential has recently been on a decline because of a rapidly aging workforce, the adverse impact of Chinese competition in connection with steel, textiles and other manufacturing, the dependence on the import of
certain key raw materials and population and structural problems, among other factors. South Korean firms are dependent upon imports. As a result, worldwide declines in energy prices may benefit the securities in the Underlying Index. Korean issuers
may also perform poorly to the extent that the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar because that may adversely affect foreign demand for their products. In this situation, investors in the Fund will be worse off than investors in a
similarly invested unhedged fund because they will share in the portion of the investments’ performance due to the fundamental business but will not share in the portion of performance that is due to currency appreciation.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>North and South
Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two continues to present the ongoing risk of war. Recent incidents involving the North Korean military have heightened tensions between North and South Korea. Any
outbreak of hostilities between the two countries could have a severe adverse effect on the South Korean economy and its securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative
pronouncements issued by the IRS.</font></div> <div>Technology Sector
Risk.<font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins.
Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these
rights may adversely affect the company’s profitability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition,
tracking error may result</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does
not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks
its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error
may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of
the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as
of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time). INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS
MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div>
<div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is
a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, South Korea. As a result, economic conditions of South Korea may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports
or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of South Korea and, as a result, securities to
which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because
non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing
market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could
result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares,
or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be</font></div> </div>

<div>impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other
third-party service providers.</div> <div>A Further Discussion of
Other Risks</div> <div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other
risks associated with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have</font></div> </div>

<div>significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector,
including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the
financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future
regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments
outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the
availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse
impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years,
cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be
unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by
changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because
companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Semiconductor Industry Risk.<font>
The Fund invests in semiconductor companies, which face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, and such competition may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets,
financial resources or personnel. The products of semiconductor companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of
qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial, and equipment generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or
impairment of these rights, would adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>

investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Korea 25/50 Index. The “MSCI Korea 25/50 Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The
Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.77%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWY, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWY, plus 0.03% through December
31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>

Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>

managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in

<div>Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage
in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of,
or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund
also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and
purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make
brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives
similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end
investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and
these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have
interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> <div>Shareholder
Information</div> <div>Additional shareholder information, including
how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWY.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change

<div>the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the
primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or
for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed
for trading on a national securities exchange.</div> <div>The
national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.
Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update
of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio
securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or
dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div> </div>

<div>BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is
unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair
value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no
appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the
event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or highly
correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with South Korea.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund
from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund</div> </div>

<div>from a real estate investment trust and distributed to a shareholder generally
will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>

<div>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the
availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div> <div>If you are
neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital
gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of
long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and
taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income”
for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</div>
<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences
under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about
the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is</div> </div>

<div>not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Spain ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization Spanish equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the euro and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Spain ETF (“EWP” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWP, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written
agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also incur usual
and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Spain ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate for
the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Spain 25/50 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Madrid Stock Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S. dollar on a
monthly basis. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight, and all
issuers with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is
represented by securities of companies in the financials and utilities industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active
management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund
track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The
notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying
Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The
Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the
euro in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the
Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the euro is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the euro. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of
a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>exposure of the Fund to the euro. While this approach is designed to minimize
the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the euro. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the
euro and the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>The Fund may also use
non-deliverable forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the
contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.</font></div>

<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>

<div>Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
Participants on an agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares
may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective.</div> <div>In seeking to track the “hedging”
component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its
portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the
Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of
a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may
not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to
hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or
its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk
with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small
number of counterparties.</div> <div>The effectiveness of the
Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of
the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the euro will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by
interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful.
Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro will reduce the value of a security denominated in the euro. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a
result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly
and without warning.</div> <div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service
providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact
the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants,</font></div>

<div>hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund
or the Underlying Fund invests.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the euro as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a
derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its
derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates,</font></div> </div>

<div>interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s
derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the
availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise
adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the
securities exchange on which the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or</font></div> </div>

<div>nationalization. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to
political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Spanish securities or Spanish markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading
volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to <font>European Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>

<div>Risk of Investing in
Spain<font>.</font><font> Investments in Spanish issuers may subject the Fund  and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic
risks specific to Spain. Among other things, Spain’s economy has been characterized by slow growth over the past few years due to factors such as low housing sales and construction declines, and the international credit crisis. Political
tensions and social conflict have escalated recently as a result of a referendum by Catalonia for independence from Spain. The secessionist movement could have a negative impact on the Spanish economy and a destabilizing effect on the
country.</font></div> <div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if
any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for
lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable
as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a
larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of
certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking
error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of
the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the
close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency
forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Deregulation, however, may subject utility companies to greater competition and may reduce their profitability.
Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of complying with regulations, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and other Financial

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or
redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater
settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the euro may
not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to influence
foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying
Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the euro may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency
hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund
when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
euro or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the euro depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the Fund’s
attempt to hedge currency exposure to the euro is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities comprising the Underlying
Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a
geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments
in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is
unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares
and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency
exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the
increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, the Underlying Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related
“cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are
not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing
operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties
to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or
their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks
may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by
the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event</font></div> </div>

<div>of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are
inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans
and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively
impacted as a result.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging
strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk,
which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly
with the currency being hedged. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and
could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements,
which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives
positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more
costly, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country
in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU
countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The
European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,
France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K.
negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks
associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or
market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new
relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the
Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may
be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political,
regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not
clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials
sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition
and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience
technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively
impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Geographic Risk.<font> Spain is located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as droughts and occasional flooding, and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely
impact Spain's economy or business operations of companies in Spain, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index
Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur
from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the
Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its
shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar
to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet
the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and
market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be
available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt
to mitigate the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the euro hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit
transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant
market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if
there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions
under any market conditions, including declining markets.</div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of
tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Spain.<font> Investment in Spanish issuers involves risks that are specific to Spain, including, legal, regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risks. The Spanish economy, along with certain other EU economies,
experienced a significant economic slowdown during the financial crisis that began in 2008. In reaction to the crisis, the Spanish government introduced austerity reforms aimed at reducing its fiscal deficit to sustainable levels. Austerity reforms
included, among other things, reduction in government employees’ salaries, freezing of pension funds, and suspension of public work projects. Such austerity reforms, while directed at stimulating the Spanish economy in the long-term, may have
a negative short-term effect on Spain’s financial markets. Due largely to outstanding bad loans to construction companies and real estate developers, Spanish banks underwent a series of mergers to increase liquidity and made efforts to shift
debt off of their balance sheets. However, reports indicate that debt levels remain high, although bank lending has contracted. In addition, unemployment rates remain high. These factors could adversely impact growth potential of Spanish stocks in
which the Fund invests. In addition, the Spanish government is engaged in a long-running campaign against terrorism. Acts of terrorism on Spanish soil or against Spanish interests abroad may cause uncertainty in the Spanish financial markets and
adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Political tensions and social conflict have escalated recently as a result of a referendum by Catalonia for independence from Spain. The secessionist movement could have
a negative impact on the Spanish economy and a destabilizing effect on the country.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any
resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative
pronouncements issued by the IRS.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error
Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected
securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between
which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may
experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other
things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the
currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the
currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font>
Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater competition and may adversely affect their profitability. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of
business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies, but may also subject these companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities
industry may have difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing large construction projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; face restrictions on operations and increased cost and
delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants, equipment or products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels
or the effects of man-made or natural disasters. Existing and future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore
may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict utility companies’ access to new markets, thereby diminishing these companies’ long-term prospects. There is no assurance that regulatory
authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks issued by a utility company. Energy conservation and changes in climate policy may also have a significant
adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because
non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing
market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could
result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding</font></div> </div>

Discussion of Other Risks</div> <div>The Fund may also be subject to
certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment;
and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit
the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a
material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or
other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a
risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying</font></div>

<div>Fund's portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be
significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (<font>e.g.</font>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general
economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely
affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Telecommunications Sector Risk.<font>
The telecommunications sector of a country's economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new
regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable.
Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological
innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and
franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other
factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information
regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA is not required to invest the Fund’s assets in any
particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Spain 25/50 Index. The “MSCI Spain 25/50 Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its affiliates. The
Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its
underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWP, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWP, plus 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon</div> </div> <div type="Block">

voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Diane
Hsiung, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Orlando Montalvo and Greg Savage are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not
limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of his or her portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his or
her portfolio management team that have more limited responsibilities.</font></div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)) and their directors, officers and employees and of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which, through a
subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in
securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions
with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in
other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The
Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest
in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase, or
distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and
other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of
the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies
(which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or
Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from
or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> <div>Shareholder

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>

market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWP.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The
Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in
the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and
redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring
for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>

maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares.
Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name”
form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The
trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the
Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each
trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to
be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best
possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations
and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if
such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a</div> </div>

generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government

not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities
markets may be fair valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good
faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that
liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by
the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax

<div>imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to,
interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Spain.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund from a
RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment
trust and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis
is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when
aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> <div>The following table shows, as of

<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the

Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Switzerland ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization Swiss equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares
MSCI Switzerland ETF (“EWL” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWL, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon
written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also
incur usual and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those
periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI Switzerland ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover
rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 14% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
Switzerland 25/50 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the Zurich Stock Exchange with the currency risk</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the U.S.
dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight,
and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is
represented by securities of companies in the consumer staples, financials and healthcare industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> </div>

<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities
not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable)
designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the
equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the Swiss franc in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge
is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Swiss franc is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower
returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the Swiss franc is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the Swiss franc. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified
amount of a specific currency in the future at an</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward
contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the Swiss franc. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the Swiss
franc. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance
that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation
where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Swiss
franc may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency
fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions
may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the
hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of
counterparties.</div> <div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the
Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates.
Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Swiss franc may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Swiss franc depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency exposure to the Swiss franc is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc will reduce the value of a security denominated in the Swiss franc. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates
of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying
Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly
and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting
in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems.
Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the
Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the Swiss franc as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or
otherwise</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to
losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements,
which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives
positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of
derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect
the value and performance of derivatives.</div> <div>Equity Securities
Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is
comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities
upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Financials Sector

<div>including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic
conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The
impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have
become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be affected by government regulations and government healthcare programs, increases or decreases in the cost of medical products and
services, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, and product liability claims, among other factors. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of a company’s patent may adversely affect that
company’s profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may result in price discounting, and may be thinly capitalized and susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to
track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a
period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more

<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Swiss securities or Swiss markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be
unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to

declining markets.</font></div> <div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk
</font><font>and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Switzerland<font>.</font><font> Investments in Swiss issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic
risks specific to Switzerland. International trade is a large component of the Swiss economy and Switzerland depends upon exports to generate economic growth. The Swiss economy relies on certain key trading partners in order to sustain continued
economic growth. Switzerland's economic growth generally mirrors slowdowns and growth spurts experienced in other countries, including the U.S. and certain Western European countries.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the
independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the Swiss economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently
deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss
carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher
magnitude</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund
were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset.
Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may
be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such
provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and
may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging
costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio
transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during
times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does
not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks
its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error
may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of
the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be</font></div> </div>

<div>influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe
competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the Swiss
franc may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to
influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the
Fund’s strategy will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of the Fund’s</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of
both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Swiss franc may impact the
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or
in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
Swiss franc or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the Swiss franc depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the Swiss franc is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>

service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s

result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (<font>e.g.</font>, through “hacking” or malicious

Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or
the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's
ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or their service
providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render
records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or
the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are
inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans
and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively
impacted as a result.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging
strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to</font></div> </div>

<div>counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction
will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The possible lack of a
liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the
Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited.
BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may
give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or restrict the
exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The
European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country
in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the
default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial
markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</font></div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or
more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant
uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European
and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect
European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically
divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the
Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K.
and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is
likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain
and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and
subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may
result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact

<div>changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various
countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector,
including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money
or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their
profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks
and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products
and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged
or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may
adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to
raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be
unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not</font></div> </div>

<div>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at
all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and
would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the
Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also
invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will
entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses
(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</font></div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div> </div>

<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security, asset or other instrument may decline due to changes in general
market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of
industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and
instruments.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in

Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution.
Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices
in such markets being less efficient.</div> <div>Secondary Market
Trading Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares
may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a
time when the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the Swiss franc hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation
Unit</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation
transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will
trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In
addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the
Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying
investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying</font></div> </div>

caused by economic and political developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div>

Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying

<div>Risk of Investing in Switzerland.<font> Investment in Swiss issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to Switzerland. Among other things, Switzerland’s economy
is heavily dependent on trading relationships with certain key trading partners, including the U.S., U.K., China, France and Germany. Future changes in the price or the demand for Swiss products or services by the U.S., U.K., China, France and
Germany or changes in these countries’ economies, trade regulations or currency exchange rates could adversely impact the Swiss economy and the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Switzerland’s economy relies heavily on the banking
sector, and in recent years, Switzerland has responded to increasing pressure from neighboring countries and trading partners to reform its banking secrecy laws. Due to the lack of natural resources, Switzerland is dependent upon imports for raw
materials. As a result, any drastic price fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials will likely have a significant impact on the Swiss economy. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the Swiss economy.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal
income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income
the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of
certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and
other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of
a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition,
tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the
Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing
directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the
Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at
4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div> <div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Switzerland. As a result, economic conditions of Switzerland may be particularly affected by changes in the
U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S.
may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Switzerland and, as a result, securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the
Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because
non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing
market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could
result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares,
or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors
by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer</font></div> </div>

<div>confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the
consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse
impact on their profitability.</div> <div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Switzerland 25/50 Index. The “MSCI Switzerland 25/50 Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its
affiliates. The Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for
the Underlying Fund are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity
measures similar to those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other
instruments that are not included in its underlying index or in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWL, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWL, plus 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Diane

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)) and their directors, officers and employees and of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which, through a
subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary

<div>Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage
in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of,
or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund
also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and
purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make
brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives
similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end
investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and
these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have
interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>

<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWL.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of
significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div> <div>The

are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of
underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated
every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other
assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular
point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update
of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio
securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or
dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when
Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Creations and Redemptions</font> section of this Prospectus) will not be able to purchase or redeem Fund shares.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div> </div>

<div>BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is
unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair
value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no
appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the
event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local markets or in related or highly
correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with Switzerland.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund
from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund</div> </div>

<div>from a real estate investment trust and distributed to a shareholder generally
will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>

availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div> <div>If you are
neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital
gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of
long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial
institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names,
addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders,
or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and
taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities
lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your
Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup
withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> <div>The prices at which
creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is</div> </div>

Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the

Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>

investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>

<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI United Kingdom ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization United Kingdom equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the
iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (“EWU” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWU, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020
only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only
upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also
incur usual and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover
rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 17% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
United Kingdom 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the London Stock Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the
U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer staples, energy
and financials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the
component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts,
cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of
the Underlying Index include equity securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward
contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value
of the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar.
The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the British pound is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to
have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the British pound is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the British pound. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified
amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the British pound. While this approach is designed to minimize
the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the British pound. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value
between the British pound and the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>The Fund
may also use non-deliverable forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the
contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a</font></div>

Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There<font> </font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such
levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div> <div>Authorized
Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act
as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the
business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the
</font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly
face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments
that have lower trading volumes.</font></div> <div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly
or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of
liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation
where the Fund is unable to</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its
investment objective.</div> <div>Currency forward contracts,
including NDFs, do not eliminate movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and
unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the
Fund’s exposure to the British pound may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is
designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as
anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or
liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single
counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div> <div>The
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the British
pound, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the British pound may
impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the British pound depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to
hedge currency exposure to the British pound is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the British pound will reduce the value of a security denominated in the British pound. In addition, fluctuations in the
exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can
change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>

distributor, or other service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause
disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to
address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers,
Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is
that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the British pound as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or
the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the
Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of
securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying
Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under
derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Dividend Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will either remain at current levels or increase over

The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures

Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their
securities may be more volatile and less liquid.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of British securities or British markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be
unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to <font>European Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading
may have an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic
Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.K.<font> Investments in U.K. issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to the U.K.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>The U.K. has one of the largest economies in Europe, and the U.S. and other
European countries are substantial trading partners of the U.K. As a result, the U.K.’s economy may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of the U.S. and other European countries. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement
in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the European Union (the “EU”) (“Brexit”). The referendum
may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash
sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the
Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less
likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative
may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its
investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In
addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in
the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time
periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the
Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential
for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and
differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the
valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or
volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on
days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding
fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s
or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a currency hedged securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in
the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing
requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new
underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or
indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asian Economic Risk.<font> Many Asian
economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency
devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, as well as economic or environmental events in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as
well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. Many Asian countries are
subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region.
Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are
subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div>

<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries,
groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of
factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
different asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management
(AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a
specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its
investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in
the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience
increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be</font></div> </div>

<div>influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe
competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a
derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be
effective. In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts, (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency
exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post
variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to
limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</font></div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the British
pound may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or otherwise. Governments from time to time may intervene in the currency markets to influence prices and may adopt policies designed to
influence foreign exchange rates with respect to their currency. Because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against
currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging
transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio in a way that tracks the Underlying Index. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well
as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a
single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In addition, the Fund’s currency hedging activities may involve frequent trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause the Fund’s return to deviate
from the Underlying Index.</div> <div>There is no assurance that the

<div>currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of
both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the British pound may impact the
effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, the currency hedging carried out by the Fund may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities comprising the Underlying Index or
in the index tracked by the Underlying Fund when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Investors, such as the Fund, seeking to trade in foreign
currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of market liquidity. These limitations
and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are necessary for the Fund to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If the Fund’s ability to enter into contracts to purchase or sell the
British pound or the Underlying Fund is impaired, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. In addition, investments in currency forwards expose the Fund to the risks described under “Derivatives Risk.”</div>
<div>Currency Risk.<font> Because the
Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the British pound depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency and/or the
Fund’s attempt to hedge currency exposure to the British pound is unsuccessful. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors may not share in appreciation in the securities
comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the value of the underlying currency. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business
operations of companies in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. that is separate from the
value of the underlying currency and, therefore, unmitigated by the hedging strategy used by the Fund. If this is the case, investors may experience better performance with a fund that is unhedged from a currency perspective than one that is hedged
from a currency perspective, as is the case with the Fund. As a result, investors in the Fund have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares and regardless of the effectiveness of the Fund’s
currency hedging transactions. The performance of the Fund may be materially better or worse than the performance of the Underlying Fund due primarily to the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>

<div>security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their
service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s
or the Underlying Fund's investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund and the Underlying Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can
result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (<font>e.g.</font>, through “hacking” or malicious
software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as
causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (<font>i.e.</font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s or the Underlying
Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or
the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's
ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the Underlying Fund or their service
providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render
records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund or
the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are
inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans
and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, hedging counterparties to the Fund, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively
impacted as a result.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk.<font> The Fund uses deliverable currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s or
the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging
strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to</font></div> </div>

<div>counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction
will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the currency being hedged. The possible lack of a
liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the
Fund or the Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited.
BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may
give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements affecting the use of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, and may delay or restrict the
exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses).</div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font> There is no
guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, such dividends will remain at current levels or increase over time.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success
of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among
other reasons: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment;
and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit
the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a
material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or
other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a
risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's
portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund each invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in
equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>European Economic Risk. <font>The EU
requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries
that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU
member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically experienced
volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and
Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries.</font></div>
<div>Responses to financial problems by European governments,
central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or
restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (Brexit). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of
negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and
consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to
instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and
the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal
consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and
investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks
to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div> <div>Secessionist
movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics
of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated
or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be
significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, including non-U.S. financials sector companies, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials
sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition
and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience
technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively
impact the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Geographic Risk.<font> The U.K. is
located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event
may adversely impact the U.K.'s economy or business operations of companies in the U.K., causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund or the Underlying Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have
market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from
Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Fund in tracking its
benchmark, which may result in the Fund's performance deviating from the return of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may also

<div>other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change
with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the
Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund. For example, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses (including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund,
although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</div>
<div>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from
portfolio transactions by the Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common portfolio securities.</div>
<div>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from
time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to hedge the currency exposure of the
instruments held by the Underlying Fund. The indirect nature of the holdings may make the hedging more difficult to achieve, and the Fund may be unable to accurately hedge currency exposure inherent in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities or counterparty on other instruments may perform poorly, causing the value of
its securities or instruments to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline.
An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth
potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities and other instruments not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that
BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>

market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of
securities and instruments.</div> <div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized
Participants.</font></div> <div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in
any market or that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain
markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund or
Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more
significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund
shares is at a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may
be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility
pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices
Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at
the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading
hours based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV
during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained
over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). However, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to mitigate the
likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the British pound hedge to implement its investment objective, including by recommending that the Fund limit purchases of Fund shares through Creation Unit
transactions. If the Fund elects to impose limitations on creation transactions, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium to NAV in the secondary market. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the NAV due to
timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant
market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying Fund shares if
there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's respective share price may be more volatile than
those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business
or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund or the Underlying Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.<font>
Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political
developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed below:</font></div> <div>

<div>liabilities and stockholders’ rights in markets in
which the Fund invests may differ and/or may not be as extensive or protective as those that apply in the U.S.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund and
the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not
address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and other instruments included in, or representative of, the Underlying
Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.<font> The economy of the country in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests is dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on the products and services of this country, institution of
tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a slowdown in the economies of any of its key trading partners may cause an adverse impact on the economies of such country and therefore, on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the U.K.<font> Investment in U.K. issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to the U.K. The U.K.’s economy relies heavily on the export of
financial services to the U.S. and other European countries. A prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a negative impact on the U.K.’s economy. In the past, the U.K. has been a target of terrorism. Acts of terrorism in the
U.K. or against U.K. interests may cause uncertainty in the U.K.’s financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan
movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the EU (Brexit). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties
and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K.
businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European
or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent
national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely
affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened
volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and
falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events
could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or the Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments
for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk.<font> </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the
listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to
incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk.<font> Because the Fund
invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will
be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these
effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitudes and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest
directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives
may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated
as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the
amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or
administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS.</div> <div>Tracking
Error Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,
differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected
securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between
which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may
experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things,
differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency
forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the NYSE, typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency
forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</font></div>
<div>U.S. Economic Risk.<font> The U.S. is
a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, the U.K. As a result, economic conditions of the U.K. may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or
exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of the U.K. and, as a result, securities to which the
Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Valuation
Risk.<font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the
security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair</font></div> </div>

<div>value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons.
Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when
shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars
using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index,
which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive
fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by
technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by the prudential regulators, which are scheduled to take effect with respect to the Fund in 2019, will require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking
organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as
well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit
the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. Implementation of these requirements may increase credit and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in
demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be
subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising</font></div> </div>

<div>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased
emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The
effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s
profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in
price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector
may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The
value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of
companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector
tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and
government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or
economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BFA and its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to
purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant
threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being
underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among direct
investments in securities and other instruments, and in investments in the Underlying Fund consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the Underlying Index as determined by the Index Provider. The Fund invests in
foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in the securities in the Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may borrow, lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial
institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Fund’s SAI.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund</div>
<div>The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the
Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which
the Fund invests, subject to the impact of currency hedges, which may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the return of the Underlying Fund. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges. The Underlying Fund invests in non-U.S. securities without implementing a hedge of the local currency risk. This strategy is subject to additional risks, as described in this Prospectus
and in the Fund’s SAI.</div> <div>BFA is not required to
invest the Fund’s assets in any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund, or allocate any particular percentage of the Fund’s assets to any particular underlying fund, including the Underlying Fund. Currently, the Fund
achieves its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund and in currency hedges.</div>
<div>The Underlying Fund seeks investment results that correspond
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI United Kingdom Index. The “MSCI United Kingdom Index” is a servicemark of MSCI and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by BFA or its
affiliates. The Underlying Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Underlying Fund or the Fund.</div>
<div>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative
sampling index strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar</div> </div>

<div>to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for the Underlying Fund
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain securities or other instruments that are not included in its underlying index or in the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.62%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in EWU, after taking into account any fee waivers by EWU, plus 0.03% through December
31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31,
2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual
fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of September 30, 2018, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.44 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services
and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may
act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and principal,
and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships
with and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the
Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt
or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the
sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have
business relationships with, and purchase, or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such
services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that
have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other
open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading
activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or
junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund

or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “HEWU.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has
little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly
launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Although the SEC has granted an exemptive order to the Trust
permitting registered investment companies and unit investment trusts that enter into a participation agreement with the Trust (“Investing Funds”) to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
subject to certain terms and conditions, the exemptive order is not applicable to the Fund. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of

<div>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the
intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's
shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not
necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets or other instruments held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV
should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other
market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not
involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted
by one or more data service providers (as detailed below) and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated
by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in
which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other instruments for which market
quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the
last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>The Fund, the Underlying Fund or both invest in non-U.S.
securities. Foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are generally determined as of 4:00 p.m., London time. The Fund will also invest in currency forward contracts, which are
generally valued as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. Non-U.S. securities held by the Fund, the Underlying Fund or both may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change on days when

<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of liquidity or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities
markets may be fair valued.</div> <div>Fair value represents a good
faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that
liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by
the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The value of assets or liabilities denominated in non-U.S.
currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. Use of a rate different from the rate used by the Index Provider may adversely affect the
Fund’s ability to track the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to
avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Unless your
investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when
the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div> <div>Taxes
on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund’s
net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to you as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend
income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
“net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div> </div>

<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period
requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend
income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with
respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company. Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has a comprehensive income tax
treaty with the U.K.</div> <div>Dividends received by the Fund from
a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) or another RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such REIT or RIC. Additionally, it is
expected that dividends received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the
dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days
before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal
income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>Short term capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund will be
ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the Fund's capital losses. Because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund's realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely
or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and
accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in
excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis
and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the
shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying
Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the
total assets of the Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as “non-U.S.”) (and 50% of
the total assets of the Fund at the close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes
(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax
deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other
disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> <div>Separately, a 30%
withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after
December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign
entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS
information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain
information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other
information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div> </div>

<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your personal
tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font>
Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or
authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>

Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash
approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the
Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,
generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities and other portfolio holdings for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. Redeeming holders will receive cash in
respect to the pro rata value of the currency forward contracts and NDFs held by the Fund to the extent attributable to the Creation Unit being redeemed. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not
redeemable by the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation</font></div> </div>

<div>Units. The standard creation and redemption transaction fees are set forth in
the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized
Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of
Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified) are also subject to an additional charge
(up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash transactions (which may, in certain instances,
be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such services.</div>

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the

<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Financial Highlights</div>
<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2017 through September 30, 2018.</div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of August 31, 2018</div>
