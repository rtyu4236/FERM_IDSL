<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet<sup>®</sup> U.S. Tech Breakthrough Index<sup>TM</sup><font> </font>(the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of U.S. listed companies engaged in cutting
edge research and development of products and services in the areas of robotics and artificial intelligence, cyber security, cloud and data tech, financial technology, and genomics and immunology (as determined by ICE Data Indices, LLC or its
affiliates) (the “Index Provider” or “IDI”). Companies selected must belong to one of the five aforementioned thematic segments and must meet the eligibility requirements of that segment to which the company is classified as
defined by the FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification Systems (“RBICS”).</div>
<div>The eligibility requirements for the Robotics and Artificial
Intelligence theme are securities must have a minimum float-adjusted market capitalization of $500 million or greater, and a three-month Average Daily Trading Value (“ADTV”) of $2 million or greater on the Reference Date.
“Reference Date” means the date in which data is used to reconstitute the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index, which is as of the close of business on the first Friday in
December, and the date in which data is used to rebalance the Underling Index, which is as of the close of business on the first Friday in June and December. Companies must also be classified as deriving 50% or more revenues from one of 22 RBICS
Focus Level 6 industries related to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, or have a 20% or more market share or generate $1 billion or more in absolute annual revenues from one of the 22 aforementioned RBICS Level 6 industry classifications.</div>
<div>The eligibility requirements for the Cyber Security theme are
securities must have a minimum float-adjusted market capitalization of $300 million or greater, and a three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on the Reference Date. Companies must also be classified as deriving 50% or more revenues from one of 12
RBICS Focus Level 6 industries related to Cyber Security, with additional screens applied to companies classified to “Multi-Type Home and Office Software.”</div>
<div>The eligibility requirements for the Cloud and Data Tech theme
are securities must have a minimum float adjusted market capitalization of $300 million or greater, and a three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on the Reference Date. Companies must also be classified as deriving 50% or more revenues from one of
20 RBICS Focus Level 6 industries related to Cloud and Data Tech, with additional screens applied to companies classified to 4 RBICS Focus Level 6 industries: “Industrial and Warehouse Equity REITs”, “Multi-Type Equity
REITs”, “General and Mixed-Type Software” or “General Information Technology (IT) Consulting.”</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The eligibility requirements for the Financial Technology theme
are securities must have a minimum float adjusted market capitalization of $300 million or greater, and a three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on the Reference Date. Companies must also be classified as deriving 50% or more revenues from one of
17 RBICS Focus Level 6 industries related to Financial Technology.</div>
<div>The eligibility requirements for the Genomics and Immunology
theme are securities must have a minimum float-adjusted market capitalization of $300 million or greater, and a three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on the Reference Date. Companies must also be classified as deriving 50% or more revenues from
one of 60 RBICS Focus Level 6 industries related to Genomics and Immunology. A Genomics and Immuno Biopharmaceutical composite relationship keyword score is then calculated for each selected company based on the number of relationships mentioning
keywords related to Genomics and Immuno Biopharmaceutical products and technologies. Companies are ranked in descending order and the top 50 ranked companies are then selected for the Genomics and Immunology theme.</div>
<div>All eligible securities that have been assigned to one of the
five aforementioned themes must also be primarily listed in one of the four U.S. exchanges: NYSE, NYSE American, NASDAQ or CBOE. All eligible securities must also be incorporated in the U.S. Finally, all remaining securities must also have a minimum
float-adjusted market capitalization of $500 million or greater, and a three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on the Reference Date.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Underlying Index will be weighted according to the
component stocks’ float-adjusted market capitalization by dividing their individual float-adjusted market capitalization by the total float adjusted market capitalization of all constituents, with individual security weights capped at 4% and
individual thematic segment weights maintained at a minimum of 10% or greater. The Underlying Index will be reviewed and reconstituted annually in December each year. Constituent weights of the Underlying Index are rebalanced semiannually. The
Underlying Index may include large-, mid- or small capitalization companies. In addition, certain companies included in the Underlying Index may also operate in business lines other than the theme to which they are assigned that also generate
revenue in other industries. As of October 31, 2019 a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the information technology industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change
over time.</div> <div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear
overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the
Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep
portfolio</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by IDI, which is independent
of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying
Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold
its</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or
scale. There<font> </font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other
market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem,
Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates.
Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</font></div>
<div>Cloud-based Computing and Data Storage Risk. <font>Companies involved in, or exposed to, cloud-based computing and data storage-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel that</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. These
companies may not be exclusively or substantially exposed to the cloud-based computing and data storage-related businesses, but may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to the market and business risks of other companies, industries or sectors. In
addition, these companies may depend on intellectual property rights to protect their computing and storage services, which may be difficult to prevent the misappropriation of, and are susceptible to competitors that may develop substantially
similar or superior technology.</div> <div>Cloud-based computing and
data storage companies also depend on the services of third-parties, which, if interrupted, may impact their products and services. These companies are also potential targets for cyberattacks, which may have a materially adverse impact on the
performance of these companies. Cloud-based computing may face increasing regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the growth of companies that develop or use this technology. Similarly,
the collection of data from consumers and other sources, and storage of that data, may face increased scrutiny as regulators consider how data may be collected, stored, safeguarded and used.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its
exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and
corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the
Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.
Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by
the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>information technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory
scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and
actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or services.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small
number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Cloud Computing Companies. <font>Cloud computing companies include companies that</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>provide remote computation, software, data access and storage services. The
risks related to investing in such companies include disruption in service caused by hardware or software failure, interruptions or delays in service by third-party data center hosting facilities and maintenance providers, security breaches
involving certain private, sensitive, proprietary and confidential information managed and transmitted by cloud computing companies, and privacy concerns and laws, evolving Internet regulation and other foreign or domestic regulations that may limit
or otherwise affect the operations of such companies. Also, the business models employed by the companies in the cloud computing industry may not prove to be successful.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Robotics
&amp; Artificial Intelligence Risk.<font> Companies involved in, or exposed to, robotics and artificial intelligence-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or
personnel. These companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend significantly on retaining and growing the consumer base of their respective products and services. Many of these companies are also
reliant on the end-user demand of products and services in various industries that may in part utilize robotics and artificial intelligence. Further, many companies involved in, or exposed to, robotics and artificial intelligence-related businesses
(as determined by the Index Provider) may</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>be substantially exposed to the market and business risks of other industries
or sectors, and the Fund may be adversely affected by negative developments impacting those companies, industries or sectors.</div>
<div>In addition, these companies are heavily dependent on
intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. There can be no assurance that companies involved in robotics and artificial intelligence will be able to successfully protect their intellectual
property to prevent the misappropriation of their technology, or that competitors will not develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to such companies’ technology. Legal and regulatory changes, particularly related
information privacy and data protection, may have an impact on a company’s products or services. Robotics and artificial intelligence companies typically engage in significant amounts of spending on research and development, and there is no
guarantee that the products or services produced by these companies will be successful. Robotics and artificial intelligence companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on
technology.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Technology Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition
and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government
and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action.</font></div>
<div>Thematic Investing Risk.<font> The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the identification of securities for inclusion in the Underlying Index that reflect themes and sub-themes and its performance may suffer if such securities are
not correctly identified or if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer if the stocks included in the Underlying Index do not benefit from the development of such themes or sub-themes. Performance may also
be impacted by the inclusion of non-theme-relevant exposures in the Underlying Index. There is no guarantee that the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index will reflect the theme and sub-theme exposures
intended.</div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur
because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested
cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market
conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. </font><font>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR
SIMILAR INDEX ETFs, ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE FUND REACHES SUFFICIENT SCALE AND FURTHER BROADENS ITS HOLDINGS.</font></div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an
“ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or
less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund
(ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
