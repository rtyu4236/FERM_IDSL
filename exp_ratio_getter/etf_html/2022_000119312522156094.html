<p><b>iShares Trust </b></p> <p><b>Supplement dated May 20,
2022 (the “Supplement”) to the </b></p> <p><b>Prospectus dated December 1, 2021 and Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”)
</b></p> <p><b>dated December 1, 2021 (as revised January 19, 2022) </b></p>
<p><b>for the iShares Morningstar Multi-Asset Income ETF (IYLD) and </b></p>
<p><b>the Prospectus and SAI, each dated March 1, 2022 </b></p>
<p><b>for the iShares Yield Optimized Bond ETF (BYLD) (each, a “Fund”) </b></p>
<p><b></b><b><i>The information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, each Fund’s Prospectus and SAI, as applicable, for
each Fund. </i></b></p> <p><b></b><b><i>The following changes are expected to take place on or around June 6, 2022. </i></b></p>
<p><b></b><b><i>Change in each Fund’s “Conflicts of Interest” section of the Prospectus </i></b></p>
<p><b>The section of each Prospectus entitled “Conflicts of Interest” for each Fund is amended to add the following paragraph after the fifth paragraph: </b></p>
<p>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor” or “BRIL”), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform
certain order processing, Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (“ETF Services”). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee
received from Authorized Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) on the design and
development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its affiliates. </p>
<p><b></b><b><i>Change in “Creation and Redemption of Creation Units” section of the SAI </i></b></p>
<p><b>The section of the SAI entitled “Costs Associated with Creation Transactions” for each Fund is deleted in its entirety and replaced
</b></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><b>
with the following, although each SAI will reflect a “Standard Creation Transaction Fee” chart only for the SAI’s applicable Fund: </b></p>
<p><b>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</b> A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated
with the issuance of Creation Units. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance
and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (“ETF Services”). BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each creation order, which consists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF Services (the
“ETF Servicing Fee”) and (2) transfer, processing and other transaction costs charged by a Fund custodian in connection with the issuance of Creation Units for such creation order (“Custody Transaction Costs”). BRIL is
entitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to the applicable Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian. </p>
<p>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, which amount will vary among different Funds based on a number
of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of securities or instruments included in a Fund’s Creation Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per order based on the number of trades,
underlying markets and settlement locations associated with the issuance of a Creation Unit. The following table sets forth the Fund’s standard creation transaction fee that would have been charged as of May 13, 2022, although the actual fee
charged to an Authorized Participant in connection with a creation order will vary depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than the fee set forth below. </p>
<p>If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,
tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized
Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Fund. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial
intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services. </p>
