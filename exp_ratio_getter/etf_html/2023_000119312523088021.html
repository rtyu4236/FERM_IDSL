The Broad Peru Equity Universe may include companies that are organized or listed, or that have significant operations, in developed countries, including the U.S. All listed Peruvian equity securities, or listed Peruvian securities that exhibit characteristics of equity securities, except for mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited partnerships, and most investment trusts, are eligible for inclusion in the Broad Peru Equity Universe. </div> <div>The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology that limits the weight of any single “group entity” (constituents that MSCI determines have a control relationship) to a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index weight, and the sum of all group entities with a weight above 5% to an aggregate of 50% of the Underlying Index weight.

Securities that are included in the Underlying Index on the basis of being headquartered or listed in Peru and having a significant linkage to Peru are generally maintained unless the company is no longer headquartered or listed in Peru, or there has been a significant change in its geographic profile over time. </div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology</span>. The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating the net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes withheld at the rate applicable to non‑resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents. </div> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_82c8b868_f242_bfe9_1b5e_eb1360fd9af2_21"><ix:continuation continuedat="t_2_a5fbdc5f_72f1_a89c_8dd4_9a125bbb9110_21"><div>If you have any questions, please call 1‑800‑iShares (1‑800‑474‑2737). </div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation> <div> </div> <ix:continuation><ix:continuation><div>iShares<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates. </div></ix:continuation></ix:continuation> <div>IS‑A‑SUPP‑EPU‑0323 </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT </div> <div>FOR FUTURE REFERENCE </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
