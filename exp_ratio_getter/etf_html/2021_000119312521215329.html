Cash flows from bond payments, including interest coupons and principal repayments of maturing or called bonds that are received during the month, are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the index. Information concerning constituent bond prices, timing and conventions and index governance and administration is provided in the ICE Bond Index Methodologies, which can be accessed on ICE’s public website (https://indices.theice.com), or by sending a request to iceindices@theice.com. </div><div>Each index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. New issues must settle on or before the following calendar month end rebalancing date in order to qualify for the coming month (e.g., an issue must settle on or before November 30 in order to be included in the index on October 31). No changes are made to constituent holdings other than on month end rebalancing dates. </div><div> </div><hr/><div><div>ICE <div>AMT-Free</div> US National Municipal Index </div></div><div><div><div>Number of Components: approximately 22,968 </div></div></div><div><div><div>Index Description.</div></div> The ICE <div>AMT-Free</div> US National Municipal Index is a broad, comprehensive, market-value weighted index designed to measure the performance of investment-grade debt publicly issued in the U.S. municipal bond market. </div><div><div><div>Component Selection Criteria.</div></div> Qualifying securities must have at least $15 million minimum par amount (i.e., currently outstanding face value) and be part of a deal with an original offering size of at least $100 million. </div><div><div>ICE Short Maturity <div>AMT-Free</div> US National Municipal Index </div></div><div><div><div>Number of Components: approximately 24,518 </div></div></div><div><div><div>Index Description.</div></div> The ICE Short Maturity <div>AMT-Free</div> US National Municipal Index is a broad, comprehensive, market-value weighted index designed to measure the performance of short maturity investment grade debt publicly issued in the U.S. municipal bond market. </div><div><div><div>Component Selection Criteria.</div></div> Qualifying securities must have at least one month but less than five years remaining term to final maturity, at least $5 million minimum par amount (i.e., currently outstanding face value) and be part of a deal with an original offering size of at least $50 million. </div><div><div>ICE <div>AMT-Free</div> California Municipal Index </div></div><div><div><div>Number of Components: approximately 3,904 </div></div></div><div><div><div>Index Description. </div></div>The ICE <div>AMT-Free</div> California Municipal Index is a broad, comprehensive, market-value weighted index designed to measure the performance of investment grade debt publicly issued in the U.S. municipal bond market by the state of California and its political subdivisions. </div><div><div><div>Component Selection Criteria. </div></div>Qualifying securities must have at least at least $15 million minimum par amount (i.e., currently outstanding face value) and be part of a deal with an original offering size of at least $100 million. </div><div> </div><hr/><div><div>ICE <div>AMT-Free</div> New York Municipal Index </div></div><div><div><div>Number of Components: approximately 6,854 </div></div></div><div><div><div>Index Description.</div></div> The ICE <div>AMT-Free</div> New York Municipal Index is a broad, comprehensive, market-value weighted index designed to measure the performance of investment grade debt publicly issued in the U.S. municipal bond market by the state of New York and its political subdivisions. </div><div><div><div>Component Selection Criteria. </div></div>Qualifying securities must have at least at least $5 million minimum par amount (i.e., currently outstanding face value) and be part of a deal with an original offering size of at least $20 million. </div><div>If you have any questions, please call <div><div>1-800-iShares</div></div> <div><div><div>(1-800-474-2737).</div></div></div> </div><div> </div><div>iShares<div>®</div> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates. </div><div><div><div><div><div><div>IS-A-Muni-Suite-07-21</div></div></div></div> </div></div><div> </div><div> </div><div>PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT </div><div>FOR FUTURE REFERENCE </div></div></div> </div>
