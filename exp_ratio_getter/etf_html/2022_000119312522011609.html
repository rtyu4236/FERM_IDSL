<p><b>iShares U.S. ETF Trust </b></p> <p><b>Supplement dated
January 19, 2022 (the “Supplement”) </b></p> <p><b>to the Prospectus (the “Prospectus”) for each of the funds </b></p>
<p><b>listed in Appendix A and Appendix B (each, a “Fund”) </b></p>
<p><b><i>The information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, each Fund’s Prospectus. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Change in “Shareholder Information” </i></b></p> <p><b>The last paragraph
in the section of the Prospectus entitled “Buying and Selling Shares” for each Fund listed in Appendix A is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></p>
<p>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities
of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the
“Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund
and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them.
Although SEC rules may permit registered investment companies and unit investment trusts (“Investing Funds”) that enter into an investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in
Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the
Fund. In addition, foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC <font>no-action</font> relief. </p>

the registered investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the Trust or Company, as applicable. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1),
