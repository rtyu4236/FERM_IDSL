<div>The iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF (the “Fund”)
seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of small-capitalization Chinese equities that are available to international investors.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 38% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the MSCI China Small Cap Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the performance of the small capitalization segment of Chinese equity
securities markets, as represented by the H-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong) and
B-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC and listed for foreign investment on stock exchanges in the PRC) markets. The Underlying Index also includes certain Hong Kong listed securities known as Red-Chips (issued by companies
incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial revenues or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and
P-Chips (issued by companies</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly
or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial revenues or allocate substantial assets in the PRC). As of August 31, 2019, approximately 6% of the Underlying Index was invested in H-shares, 20% in Red-Chips, 56% in P-Chips, 4% in
B-shares and 13% in foreign listed securities. As of August 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary and real estate industries or sectors. The components of the
Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div> <div>BFA uses
a “passive” or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions
when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may
eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance
by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market
capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Fund generally will invest at least
90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index
(<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of
money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the
Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding
the market value of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry
Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>(<font>i.e.</font>, hold 25% or more of its total
assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and
repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creation and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus
(the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of
institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the
business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase
and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for
exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable income, consumer preferences,
social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div> <div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates
against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably.
As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and
depositories.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by the Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will either remain at current levels or increase over
time.</font></div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of
common stocks, which</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and
debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in China, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in China, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in
China.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit
rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments that track the value of Chinese issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in China, such as heightened risks of inflation or
nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Chinese securities or Chinese markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be
unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at
times. The Fund is specifically exposed to <font>Asian Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> The country in which the Fund invests has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized.</font></div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font> The Fund may invest in companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) or real estate holding and operating
companies, which expose investors in the Fund to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general
and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize leverage (and some may be
highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially magnify the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies,
which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs.</div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse
impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China<font>.
</font><font>Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed securities, subject the Fund to risks specific to China. Investments in certain Hong Kong-listed securities may also
subject the Fund to exposure to Chinese companies. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in
comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally
continue to experience inefficiency,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack
of publicly available information and/or political and social instability. Internal social unrest or confrontations with other neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in
China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation. China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations.
Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or
cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Incidents involving China's or the region's security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets
and may adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or
other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S., or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China's key trading partners may have an
adverse impact on the Chinese economy.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in
Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> The Fund's investments in China may be subject to a greater risk</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed
markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, less
reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated with custody of securities than developed markets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Hong Kong. <font>Investments in Hong Kong issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific to Hong Kong. China is Hong Kong’s largest trading partner,
both in terms of exports and imports. Any changes in the Chinese economy, trade regulations or currency exchange rates, or a tightening of China’s control over Hong Kong, may have an adverse impact on Hong Kong’s economy.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small-Capitalization
Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse
developments. In addition, the securities of small-capitalization</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and
large-capitalization companies.</div> <div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing
regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may
result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK
SUCH INDICES.</div> <div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the
value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days
when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
