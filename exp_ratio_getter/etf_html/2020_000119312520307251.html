<div>The iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large and mid-capitalization developed and emerging market equities with a lower carbon exposure than that of the broad market.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 15% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is designed to address two
dimensions of carbon exposure – carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. By overweighting companies with low carbon emissions relative to sales and those with low potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel
reserves relative to market capitalization, the Underlying Index aims to reflect a lower carbon exposure than that of the broad market. Carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves are measured based on an issuer’s
reported data from annual reports, corporate social responsibility reports, the Carbon Disclosure Project, oil and gas industry bodies, and other relevant third-party sources. If an issuer does not report carbon emissions or potential carbon
emissions from fossil fuel reserves, the data are estimated by MSCI using a proprietary model.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Underlying Index is designed to achieve a target level of
tracking relative to the MSCI ACWI Index (the “Parent Index”) while minimizing carbon exposure. The Underlying Index is a subset of the Parent Index that measures the combined equity market performance of developed and emerging market
countries. The Parent Index serves as the universe of eligible securities for the Underlying Index. Securities included in the Parent Index are first assigned a “carbon exposure” measured in terms of the issuer’s greenhouse gas
emissions (relative to the issuer’s annual sales, as measured by the most recent calendar year sales or closest fiscal year sales) and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves held by the issuer (per dollar of such issuer’s
market capitalization, as measured during the semi-annual index review). The Underlying Index is then constructed using a process that aims to achieve replicability and investability, subject to the following objective and constraints: (i) minimize
carbon exposure subject to a tracking error constraint of 30 basis points relative to the Parent Index; (ii) the maximum weight of an Underlying Index constituent may not be greater than 20 times its weight in the Parent Index; (iii) country weights
in the Underlying Index may not deviate more than 2% from the country weights in the Parent Index; and (iv) sector weights in the Underlying Index may not deviate more than 2% from the sector weights in the Parent Index, with the exception of the
energy sector, where there is no weight constraint applied. The Underlying Index may still include significant exposure to large companies that have proportionately greater carbon exposure relative to smaller companies with lower carbon
exposure</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>due to the Underlying Index’s constraints on deviating from the market
capitalization of Parent Index constituents.</div> <div>The
Underlying Index includes large- and mid-capitalization companies and may change over time. As of July 31, 2020, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the information technology industry or
sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of July 31, 2020, the Underlying Index consisted of securities from the following countries or regions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S.(together, the “ACWI countries”). The lower carbon exposure
sought by the Underlying Index may have no impact on (or no correlation with) the investment performance of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower
costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as
well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>

<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index and Parent Index are sponsored by MSCI,
which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and Parent Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index and Parent Index.</div> <div>Industry
Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a
particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase
agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial
markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the carbon exposure of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and
estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s carbon exposure calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>assessment of an issuer’s actual and potential carbon emissions.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund
invests.</div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of
common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the
bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of
companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or
expected composition.</div> <div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by
the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the information technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the software industry may be
adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or services.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial
condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Low Carbon Exposure Investment Strategy Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund’s strategy of investing in securities of companies with low carbon exposure limits the type and number of investment opportunities available to
the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds that do not seek to minimize carbon exposure. The Fund’s low carbon exposure investment strategy may result in the Fund investing in securities or industry sectors that
underperform the market.</font></div> <div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended
results.</font></div> <div>Market
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local,
regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities
and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at
times.</div> <div>Operational
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication
errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures.
However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries.</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Certain developed countries have experienced security concerns, such as
terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments. In addition, developed
countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory, currency and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves
risks associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the
U.S., Canada and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against
foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government or Russian companies, may impact Russia’s economy and
Russian issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Saudi
Arabia<font>.</font><font> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) to invest in Saudi Arabian issuers is new and untested. Such ability could</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>be restricted or revoked by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and
unforeseen risks could materialize due to foreign ownership in such securities. The economy of Saudi Arabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained decrease in petroleum prices could have a negative impact on all aspects of the economy.
Investments in securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involves risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened
risks may include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. There remains the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of
Saudi Arabia, and there is no assurance of political stability in Saudi Arabia.</div>
<div>Saudi Arabia Broker Risk.<font> There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in equity securities in the Saudi Arabian market. The Fund generally expects to conduct its transactions in a manner in which the Fund
would not be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who can provide services to the Fund, which may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity or timing of Fund
transactions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have
an adverse effect on the securities to which the Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the
accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to
the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may
result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding
fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value
investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Performance Information</div>
<div>The bar chart and table that follow show how the Fund has
performed on a calendar year basis and provide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Both assume that all dividends and distributions have been reinvested in the Fund. Past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. If BFA had not waived certain Fund fees during certain periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower.</div>

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

Fund Advisors.</font></div> <div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a

<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
