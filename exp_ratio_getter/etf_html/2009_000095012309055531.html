    See, however, the discussion of termination of the Trust in this
    Prospectus for a description of the circumstances in which SPDRs
    may be redeemed in less than a Creation Unit size  aggregation
    of 50,000 SPDRs.
</div>

<div>
    The second paragraph after the title “SPDRs Make Periodic
    Dividend Payments” on page 10 of the prospectus is
    hereby deleted and replaced with the following:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
    Quarterly distributions based on the amount of dividends payable
    with respect to Portfolio Securities and other income received
    by the Trust, net of fees and expenses, and taxes, if
    applicable, are made via DTC and its participants to Beneficial
    Owners on each Dividend Payment Date. Any capital gain income
    recognized by the Trust in any taxable year that is not
    previously treated as distributed during the year ordinarily is
    to be distributed at least annually in January of the following
    taxable year. The Trust may make additional distributions
    shortly after the end of the year in order to satisfy certain
    distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986, as amended (“Code”). Although all
    distributions are currently made quarterly, under certain
    limited circumstances the Trustee may vary the periodicity with
    which distributions are made. Those Beneficial Owners interested
    in reinvesting their quarterly distributions may do so through a
    dividend reinvestment service, if one is offered by their
    broker-dealer. Under limited certain circumstances, special
    dividend payments also may be made to the Beneficial Owners. See
    “Administration of the Trust — Distributions to
    Beneficial Owners.”
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
    The entire section under the title “DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
    SERVICE” on pages 56-57 of the prospectus is hereby
    deleted and replaced with the following:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
    Broker-dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a dividend
    reinvestment service under which additional SPDRs are purchased
    in the secondary market at current market prices. Investors
    should consult their broker dealer for further information
    regarding any dividend reinvestment program offered by such
    broker dealer.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
    Distributions in cash that are reinvested in additional SPDRs
    through  a dividend reinvestment service, if offered by an
    investor’s broker-dealer, will nevertheless be taxable
    dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been
    received in cash.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
    The footnote appearing on page 57 of the prospectus is
    hereby deleted in its entirety.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
    The last paragraph after the title “Distributions to
    Beneficial Owners” on page 62 of the prospectus is
    hereby deleted in its entirety.
