<p><b>iShares Trust </b></p> <p><b>Supplement dated July 9,
2024 </b></p> <p><b>to the currently effective Summary Prospectus, Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for the
iShares LifePath Target Date 2025 ETF (ITDA) </b></p> <p>The Board of Trustees of iShares Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the “Trust”), has approved
an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Agreement and Plan”), by and between the iShares LifePath Target Date 2025 ETF (the “Target Fund”) and the iShares LifePath Retirement ETF (the “Acquiring Fund”), each a
series of the Trust, pursuant to which the Target Fund will be reorganized into the Acquiring Fund (the “Reorganization”). The Reorganization is expected to be <font>tax-free</font> for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, except for any taxes that may be imposed as a result of the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. </p> <p>In the Reorganization, the Target Fund will
transfer substantially all of its assets to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of certain stated liabilities of the Target Fund and shares of the Acquiring Fund (the “Acquiring Fund Shares”) and cash in
lieu of fractional shares, if any. </p> <p>The Agreement and Plan provides that each shareholder of the Target Fund will receive shares of the Acquiring Fund with an
aggregate net asset value (“NAV”) equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares such shareholder of the Target Fund owns immediately prior to the Reorganization, minus cash received by the shareholder in lieu of fractional shares of the
Acquiring Fund, if any. </p> <p>Following the Reorganization, the Target Fund will be terminated, dissolved and liquidated as a series of the Trust. </p>
<p>Consummation of the Reorganization will be subject to a number of conditions. Neither the shareholders of the Target Fund nor the Acquiring Fund are required to approve
the Reorganization. It is expected that in September 2024, shareholders of the Target Fund will be sent a Combined Prospectus/Information Statement containing important information about the Acquiring Fund, outlining the differences between the
Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund and containing information about the terms and conditions of the Reorganization. </p> <p>The Reorganization is expected to occur during
the fourth quarter of 2024. At any time before the Reorganization, a shareholder may sell shares of the Target Fund. </p> <p>If you have any questions, please call <font><font>1-800-iShares</font></font> <font><font><font>(1-800-474-2737).</font></font></font> </p>
