Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund will wind up and terminate on or about December 15, 2026. Upon its </span><span>termination, the Fund will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after making </span><span>appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current shareholders </span><span>pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In the final months of the Fund's operations, as the </span><span>bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents. To the </span><span>extent that the Fund invests in money market or similar funds, it will incur the fees and </span><span>expenses of such funds. By December 15, 2026, the Underlying Index value will be </span><span>represented almost entirely by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying </span><span>Index. In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the </span><span>Fund will terminate on or about the date noted above, as approved by a majority of the </span><span>Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board</span><span>”</span><span>), without requiring additional approval by Fund </span><span>shareholders. The Board may extend the termination date if a majority of the Board </span><span>determines the extension to be in the best interest of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Many Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may </span><span>have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a </span><span>decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </span><span>favorable features.</span></div> <div><span>Commodity Risk. </span><span>Companies whose performance is reflected in the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>or Underlying Index may be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, </span><span>including, where applicable, high volatility, changes in supply and demand </span><span>relationships, weather, agriculture, trade, pestilence, political instability, war, </span><span>catastrophic events, changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental </span><span>policies, action and inaction, including price changes due to trade relations. Securities </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of companies held by the Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are </span><span>concentrated in a single commodity sector, may typically exhibit even higher volatility </span><span>attributable to commodity prices.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Cyclical Industry Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer cyclical companies is </span><span>tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in demographics and </span><span>preferences. Companies in the consumer cyclical industry depend heavily on </span><span>disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected </span><span>by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal </span><span>payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of </span><span>credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the </span><span>terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit </span><span>rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit </span><span>ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal </span><span>payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may </span><span>worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share price.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the </span><span>scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or </span><span>from entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business </span><span>continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber </span><span>incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the </span><span>possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation </span><span>efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the </span><span>Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service </span><span>providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively </span><span>impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Declining Yield Risk.</span><span> During the six months prior to the Fund's planned termination </span><span>date, the bonds held by the Fund will mature and the Fund’s portfolio will convert to </span><span>cash or cash equivalents. During these final six months, the Fund’s yield will generally </span><span>tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields </span><span>of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in </span><span>the market.</span></div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span><span>The success of companies in</span><span>the energy sector may be cyclical </span><span>and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by </span><span>companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: </span><span>changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, </span><span>and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; the enactment or </span><span>cessation of trade sanctions; war or other geopolitical conflicts; and energy </span><span>conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in </span><span>this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed </span><span>pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these </span><span>companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a </span><span>relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a </span><span>result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the </span><span>stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or </span><span>engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a </span><span>history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies </span><span>also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or </span><span>mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political </span><span>strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the </span><span>general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be </span><span>significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, oil and </span><span>natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government </span><span>subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may </span><span>have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to </span><span>restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global </span><span>economy.</span></div> <div><span>In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries </span><span>regarding potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has </span><span>experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude </span><span>oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front </span><span>month WTI crude oil futures contracts (those with the nearest expiration date) falling </span><span>below zero for a period of time. Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February </span><span>24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and </span><span>commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and </span><span>demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the U.S. </span><span>announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect </span><span>of the U.S. ban and any similar bans by other countries, as well as the extent and </span><span>duration of the Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated market </span><span>disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of </span><span>factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant </span><span>and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk. </span><span>The Fund, unlike a direct </span><span>investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, </span><span>will make distributions of income that vary over time. It is expected that an investment </span><span>in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a </span><span>direct investment in a group of bonds of similar credit quality and maturity to those </span><span>held by the Fund, but unlike a direct investment in bonds, the breakdown of returns </span><span>between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time </span><span>of your investment. The Fund may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than </span><span>the coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which would result in the Fund </span><span>returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. </span><span>The breakdown between Fund distribution payments and the amount of liquidation </span><span>proceeds may adversely affect the tax characterization of your returns from an </span><span>investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in bonds. If the amount you </span><span>receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than </span><span>your cost basis, you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. In addition, the </span><span>yield on your investment (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the return on your purchase price) may be lower (or </span><span>higher) than the Fund's published yields, which are based on the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>High Yield Securities Risk.</span><span> Securities that are rated below investment-grade </span><span>(commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds,</span><span>”</span><span> which may include those bonds rated below </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>“</span><span>BBB-</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below </span><span>“</span><span>Baa3</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody’s), or are unrated, </span><span>may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated </span><span>securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default. BBB-rated bonds, </span><span>although investment-grade, may share some of the same speculative characteristics as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield securities investments include:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield </span><span>securities may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than </span><span>issuers of investment-grade bonds. In the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, claims of </span><span>other creditors may have priority over the claims of high yield securities holders, </span><span>leaving few or no assets available to repay high yield securities holders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse </span><span>changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic conditions may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income </span><span>securities. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its </span><span>market value risk. Ratings and market value may change from time to time, </span><span>positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Issuers of high yield securities may be unable to meet their interest or principal </span><span>payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer </span><span>developments, or the unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to </span><span>repurchase the security from the Fund before it matures. If the issuer redeems high </span><span>yield securities held by the Fund, the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds </span><span>with lower yields and may lose income. Such use of proceeds will occur when the </span><span>Fund invests in BBB-rated bonds from the Corporate Index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, </span><span>even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer dealers in the high yield </span><span>securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for </span><span>high yield securities by the dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid </span><span>than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>valuing certain of the Fund's</span><span> </span><span> securities than is the case with securities trading in a </span><span>more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default </span><span>or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in </span><span>income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding </span><span>instruments, as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in </span><span>the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase </span><span>additional bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index </span><span>may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the </span><span>Underlying Index’s stated maturity guidelines. In addition, the Fund's income is </span><span>expected to decline in the months leading up to its maturity date because it will </span><span>increasingly hold primarily cash and cash equivalents. As the Fund does not seek to </span><span>return any predetermined amount at maturity or in periodic distributions, the amount </span><span>of income generated by the Fund may vary during its term.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund. To the extent that the Underlying Index includes a non-standard methodology, </span><span>errors in index data, index computation or the construction of the Underlying Index </span><span>may be more likely to occur.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly </span><span>use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making </span><span>their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. For example, </span><span>if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will </span><span>likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the </span><span>extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities </span><span>with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income </span><span>markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only </span><span>periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and </span><span>significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value </span><span>of the Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, </span><span>decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading </span><span>volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in </span><span>certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative </span><span>yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions </span><span>and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates </span><span>or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the </span><span>future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on </span><span>various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely </span><span>affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an </span><span>issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal </span><span>or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the </span><span>value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor </span><span>management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of </span><span>patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate </span><span>restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those </span><span>securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. An issuer may also be </span><span>subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer </span><span>resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</span><span> </span><span>Market </span><span>risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of financial instruments and </span><span>may be influenced by price, currency and interest rate movements. It represents the </span><span>potential loss the Fund may suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of </span><span>market movements or uncertainty. The value of a security, asset, or other instrument </span><span>may decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events </span><span>that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors </span><span>that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, </span><span>industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events </span><span>such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health </span><span>issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and its </span><span>investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally less sensitive to such </span><span>changes than are fixed-income securities with longer-term maturities. Changes in </span><span>market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all </span><span>types of securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant </span><span>redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </span><span>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM </span><span>OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in </span><span>Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the </span><span>Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end</span><span> funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at </span><span>premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make </span><span>it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices </span><span>close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate </span><span>exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and </span><span>other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, </span><span>and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for </span><span>shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be </span><span>less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for </span><span>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>North American Economic Risk</span><span>. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a </span><span>significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of </span><span>the North American countries in which the Fund invests. </span></div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The </span><span>Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the </span><span>U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade </span><span>among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including </span><span>the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of </span><span>the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on </span><span>July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>result, the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one </span><span>country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as </span><span>on the value of certain securities held by the Fund. </span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a </span><span>general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, </span><span>including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S </span><span>under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of </span><span>purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of </span><span>time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there </span><span>may be relatively few potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse </span><span>market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial </span><span>condition of the issuer, the Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when </span><span>it may be advisable to do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices </span><span>lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also may be </span><span>more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing </span><span>the Fund’s NAV due to the absence of an active trading market. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when purchased </span><span>will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and its value may decline </span><span>as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Reinvestment Risk</span><span>. The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in short-term fixed-income</span><span> instruments and as a result, may be adversely affected when interest rates fall </span><span>because it may have to invest in lower yielding bonds</span><span> </span><span>as bonds in the Fund's portfolio </span><span>mature. This may cause the Fund's income to decline, which may adversely affect the </span><span>value of the Fund. This risk is typically greater with respect to short-term bond funds </span><span>and lower for long-term bond funds.</span></div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> The economies of many countries or regions in </span><span>which the Fund invests are highly dependent on trade with certain key trading partners. </span><span>Reduction in spending on products and services by these key trading partners, </span><span>institution of tariffs or other trade barriers or a slowdown in the economies of key </span><span>trading partners may adversely affect the performance of any company in which the </span><span>Fund invests and may have a material adverse effect on the Fund's performance.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index (including as a result of </span><span>differences in bond maturity dates), pricing differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, </span><span>differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's </span><span>valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs </span><span>incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of </span><span>the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through </span><span>tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital </span><span>gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index </span><span>or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of </span><span>increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may </span><span>result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does </span><span>not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN HIGH </span><span>YIELD SECURITIES MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods </span><span>when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other assets in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will </span><span>not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Capital Goods Industry Risk. </span><span>Companies in the capital goods group of industries </span><span>include aerospace and defense, building products, construction and engineering, and </span><span>other manufacturers of capital intensive products. Companies in the capital goods </span><span>industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors </span><span>affecting manufacturing demands. The capital goods industry depends heavily on </span><span>corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during </span><span>times of economic expansion, but as economic conditions worsen, the demand for </span><span>capital goods may decrease. Many capital goods are sold internationally, and </span><span>companies in this industry may be affected by market conditions in other countries and </span><span>regions.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Communication Services Sector Risk.</span><span> The communication services sector consists </span><span>of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the </span><span>media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication </span><span>services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry </span><span>group encompass a variety of services and products including television broadcasting, </span><span>gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review </span><span>websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services </span><span>sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>government regulation, and obsolescence of communications products and services </span><span>due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, </span><span>shifting demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can </span><span>drastically affect a communication services company's profitability. In addition, while </span><span>all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in </span><span>the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could </span><span>have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to </span><span>extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental </span><span>regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the </span><span>enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the </span><span>area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and </span><span>unpredictable. The communications services industry can also be significantly affected </span><span>by intense competition for market share, including competition with alternative </span><span>technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and </span><span>standardization, consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and </span><span>development of new products, lack of standardization or compatibility with existing </span><span>technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in </span><span>the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the </span><span>need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications </span><span>companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to </span><span>obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing </span><span>and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide </span><span>an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to </span><span>market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation </span><span>of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative </span><span>effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may </span><span>be subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive </span><span>challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic joint ventures </span><span>with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. </span><span>competitors.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by </span><span>several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and </span><span>services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer </span><span>tastes and interests, and the potential increase in government regulation. Companies </span><span>in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising </span><span>spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. </span><span>During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, </span><span>media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Tobacco and tobacco-related companies, in particular, may be </span><span>adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer </span><span>staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be </span><span>subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU reached an agreement on the terms of </span><span>their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to </span><span>the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further </span><span>discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not </span><span>covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund faces risks </span><span>associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, </span><span>including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could </span><span>adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market </span><span>conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory </span><span>agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead </span><span>to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the </span><span>U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Any of these effects could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has </span><span>exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The political, economic and </span><span>legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial </span><span>markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and </span><span>Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have </span><span>been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value </span><span>or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be </span><span>a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. </span><span>continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</span></div> <div><span>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the </span><span>independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to </span><span>such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, </span><span>the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU </span><span>countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and </span><span>political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in </span><span>sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents </span><span>throughout Europe or war in the region could also impact financial markets. The impact </span><span>of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could </span><span>adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy and Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action </span><span>may also impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural </span><span>gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral </span><span>impacts on such sectors globally.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. The Fund may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S.</span><span> corporate issuers. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies </span><span>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth </span><span>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency</span><span> and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or </span><span>governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less </span><span>liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the </span><span>value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the </span><span>issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries.</span><span>Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Transportation Industry Risk.</span><span> Companies in the transportation industry may be </span><span>adversely affected by changes in the economy, increases in fuel and operating costs, </span><span>labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, insurance costs, industry </span><span>competition and government regulation. Companies in the transportation industry are </span><span>also affected by severe weather events, mass casualty accidents or environmental </span><span>catastrophes, acts of terrorism and other similar events that target or damage </span><span>transportation infrastructure or vessels, war or risk of war, widespread disruption of </span><span>technology systems and increasing equipment and operational costs. Such global or </span><span>regional events and conditions may adversely affect the operations, financial condition </span><span>and liquidity of companies in the transportation industry and cause insurance </span><span>premiums to increase dramatically or result in insurance coverage becoming </span><span>unavailable for certain business lines or assets. Securities of companies in the </span><span>transportation industry are generally cyclical and occasionally subject to sharp price </span><span>movements.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, net of any applicable </span><span>waivers, at the annual rate of 0.35%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of </span><span>its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if </span><span>any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other funds advised by BFA or its </span><span>affiliates through the termination date of the Fund. The contractual waiver may be </span><span>terminated prior to the Fund's termination only upon the written agreement of the </span><span>Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or </span><span>reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses </span><span>(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or </span><span>reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned</span><span> subsidiary of BlackRock. As of December 31, 2022, BFA and its affiliates </span><span>provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $8.6 trillion. BFA and its </span><span>affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of </span><span>securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such </span><span>securities.</span></div> <div><span>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board of the Investment </span><span>Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's Annual Report for the period </span><span>ended October 31.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers.</span><span> James Mauro and Karen Uyehara are primarily responsible for </span><span>the day-to-day management of the Fund.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves as custodian for the Fund in connection with </span><span>certain securities lending activities.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts of Interest. </span><span>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including </span><span>BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Affiliates</span><span>”</span><span>)), and their respective </span><span>directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own </span><span>accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the </span><span>returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the </span><span>loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to </span><span>which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>IBHF.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the </span><span>Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. The </span><span>Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term </span><span>capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have </span><span>held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of </span><span>15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income </span><span>exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% </span><span>U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with </span><span>incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the </span><span>year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated </span><span>as paid on December 31 of the prior year. Certain states and localities may exempt </span><span>from tax distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations.</span></div> <div><span>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your </span><span>Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.

Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for </span><span>a single share of the Fund. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an </span><span>investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the Fund, assuming </span><span>reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by </span><span>PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial </span><span>statements, in the Fund's Annual Report (available upon request).</span></div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span> <br/><span>(For a share outstanding throughout each period)</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the </span><span>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The </span><span>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </span><span>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or </span><span>beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </span><span>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall </span><span>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </span><span>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each of the iShares iBonds Dec 2023 Term Corporate ETF, iShares iBonds Dec 2024 Term Corporate ETF, iShares iBonds Dec </span><span>2025 Term Corporate ETF, iShares iBonds Dec 2026 Term Corporate ETF, iShares iBonds Dec 2027 Term Corporate ETF and </span><span>iShares iBonds Dec 2028 Term Corporate ETF is managed by BFA and generally seeks to meet its investment objective by </span><span>investing in securities of its Underlying Index and may, under certain circumstances, invest in one or more Underlying Funds. </span><span>Because a Fund may periodically obtain its exposure to the securities in the Underlying Index by investing in one or more </span><span>Underlying Funds, shareholders should be aware that the Fund’s exposure to the types of investments discussed below may </span><span>be obtained by the Fund through an investment in the Underlying Funds.

Each Fund operates as an index </span><span>fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the </span><span>elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, </span><span>maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index.

By December 15 of the relevant year, each Fund's </span><span>Underlying Index is expected to consist almost entirely of cash earned in this manner. Around the same time, the Fund will </span><span>wind up and terminate, and its net assets will be distributed to then-current shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation.</span></div> <div><span>Bonds.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund, either directly or through its investments in one or more Underlying Funds, invests a substantial portion </span><span>of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company or </span><span>governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to </span><span>repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are used by issuers to </span><span>borrow money from investors.</span></div> <div><span>An issuer may have the right to redeem or </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> a bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the </span><span>proceeds at lower market rates.</span><span> </span><span>Similarly, the Funds may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds </span><span>mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a </span><span>“</span><span>coupon</span><span>”</span><span> rate that is fixed for the life of the </span><span>bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. </span><span>Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its </span><span>value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is </span><span>purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its </span><span>face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such </span><span>fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of </span><span>bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on </span><span>“</span><span>floating rate</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>variable rate</span><span>”</span><span> bonds </span><span>may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final maturities. </span><span>Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of </span><span>“</span><span>floating rate</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>variable rate</span><span>”</span><span> bonds fluctuates much less in </span><span>response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline if their interest </span><span>rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may treat some of </span><span>these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment </span><span>portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of </span><span>lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds </span><span>may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets </span><span>and, in the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the </span><span>issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Bonds.</span><span>  </span><span>Both the Funds and the Underlying Funds invest a substantial portion of their assets in investment-grade </span><span>and/or high yield corporate bonds. The investment return of corporate bonds reflects interest earned on the security and </span><span>changes in the market value of the security. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market </span><span>rate of interest, the credit rating of the issuer, the issuer’s performance and perceptions of the issuer in the marketplace. </span><span>There is a risk that the issuers of the securities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at </span><span>the time called for by an instrument.</span></div> <div><span>Diversification Status.</span><span>  </span><span> The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</span><span> </span><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

Each Fund and each </span><span>Underlying Fund intend to use futures and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading </span><span>Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to the Funds, has </span><span>claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, </span><span>with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of this SAI for more information.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. The Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts </span><span>that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the </span><span>purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. </span><span>There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </span><span>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </span><span>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span> A call option gives a holder </span><span>the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option </span><span>gives a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of </span><span>a call option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not </span><span>such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the </span><span>market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is </span><span>committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability </span><span>to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may </span><span>purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) market </span><span>through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the </span><span>appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or </span><span>physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable </span><span>only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in </span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>High Yield Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Non-investment grade or </span><span>“</span><span>high yield</span><span>”</span><span> fixed-income or convertible securities are commonly known to </span><span>investors as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>high yield bonds.</span><span>”</span><span> These are generally debt securities that are rated below investment grade by </span><span>one or more of the major rating agencies or are unrated securities that BFA believes are of comparable quality. While </span><span>generally providing greater income and opportunity for gain, non-investment grade debt securities may be subject to greater </span><span>risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including a high risk of default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. </span><span>High yield securities will generally be in the lower rating categories of recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by </span><span>Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Moody's</span><span>”</span><span>) or below BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>S&amp;P Global Ratings</span><span>”</span><span>) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Fitch</span><span>”</span><span>)) or be unrated. The credit rating of a high yield security does not </span><span>necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from time to time change, positively or negatively, to reflect </span><span>developments regarding the issuer’s financial condition. High yield securities are considered to be speculative with respect to </span><span>the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest in accordance with the terms of the obligation and may </span><span>have more credit risk than higher rated securities. BBB-rated bonds, although investment-grade, may share some of the same </span><span>speculative characteristics as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield bond investments include the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. These securities are vulnerable to adverse changes in </span><span>the issuer’s industry or to general economic conditions. Issuers of high yield bonds may be unable to meet their </span><span>interest or principal payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer developments or the </span><span>unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The issuers of high yield bonds may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than issuers of </span><span>investment grade bonds. If the issuer experiences financial stress, it may be unable to meet its debt obligations. The </span><span>issuer’s ability to pay its debt obligations also may be lessened by specific issuer developments, or the unavailability </span><span>of additional financing. Issuers of high yield securities are often in the growth stage of their development and/or </span><span>involved in a reorganization or takeover.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds are frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its obligations, </span><span>the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit a Fund’s ability </span><span>to fully recover principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to receive </span><span>restructuring benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities </span><span>frequently have a lower degree of protection with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in </span><span>higher rated securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the security from a Fund </span><span>before it matures. If an issuer redeems the high yield bonds, a Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds with </span><span>lower yields and may lose income. Such use of proceeds will occur when a Fund invests in BBB-rated bonds from </span><span>the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index (the </span><span>“</span><span>Corporate Index</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield bonds are subject to extreme fluctuations. Negative economic developments may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield bonds than on those of other higher rated fixed-income securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Under certain economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield </span><span>securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. There are fewer dealers in the high </span><span>yield bond market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for high yield bonds by dealers, and </span><span>such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. Judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>the prices and values generated for such securities than in the case of securities trading in a more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The secondary markets for high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for higher rated </span><span>securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and, </span><span>participants in the markets are mostly institutional investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial </span><span>institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that </span><span>for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could contract under adverse market or economic conditions </span><span>independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or </span><span>market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield securities due to the limited number of </span><span>investors in that sector of the market. An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the market price of the high </span><span>yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and obtaining accurate market </span><span>quotations on the issue when valuing a Fund's assets. Market quotations on high yield securities are available only </span><span>from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. </span><span>When the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, or in the absence of readily available </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable objective data makes it more difficult to value such </span><span>securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such valuations.</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a </span><span>defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The high yield bond markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy, or to the </span><span>perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis. Additionally, prices </span><span>for high yield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could </span><span>adversely affect a Fund’s NAV and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial </span><span>condition of issuers of these securities and the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a </span><span>thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured savings and loan </span><span>associations of their investments in high yield bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by certain corporate </span><span>issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Investments in Underlying Funds and Other Investment Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>To implement its asset allocation strategy, each Fund </span><span>may invest some or all of its assets in one or more Underlying Funds. Each Underlying Fund generally invests directly in </span><span>portfolio securities. Each Fund may also invest in other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (commonly </span><span>referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) that are not iShares ETFs, to the extent permitted by law.</span></div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </span><span>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the Fund exceeds one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets </span><span>(including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </span><span>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </span><span>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </span><span>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </span><span>are subject to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </span><span>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to </span><span>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </span><span>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending </span><span>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </span><span>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a </span><span>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span><span>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the </span><span>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </span><span>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </span><span>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </span><span>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </span><span>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

There could also </span><span>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </span><span>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </span><span>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including ETFs such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance </span><span>disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program, and </span><span>the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as the administrator of the </span><span>Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk </span><span>and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </span><span>“</span><span>highly liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>moderately liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>less liquid </span><span>investment</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>illiquid investment.</span><span>”</span><span> The Liquidity Rule defines </span><span>“</span><span>liquidity risk</span><span>”</span><span> as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests </span><span>to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a </span><span>Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations under </span><span>the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a </span><span>less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers may be deemed to be located in a particular country </span><span>if: (i) the principal trading market for the security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the laws of such </span><span>country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets </span><span>situated in such country or, (iv) the issuer is the government of the particular country.</span></div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities.</span><span>  </span><span> The Funds or an Underlying Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that </span><span>may be resold only in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Restricted Securities</span><span>”</span><span>). Restricted </span><span>Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a purchaser's ability to acquire or </span><span>resell such securities. Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for specific Restricted Securities may vary. Delay or difficulty in </span><span>selling such securities may result in a loss to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Ratings. </span><span> </span><span>An investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of </span><span>Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating </span><span>organization (</span><span>“</span><span>NRSRO</span><span>”</span><span>) by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated </span><span>Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered </span><span>“</span><span>investment-grade</span><span>”</span><span> securities, </span><span>bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain </span><span>speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to meet financial commitments.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Subsequent to purchase by a Fund or an Underlying Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced </span><span>below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s or below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are </span><span>generally considered below investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered </span><span>predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of </span><span>the obligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and </span><span>increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds</span><span>”</span><span> and are subject to a </span><span>substantial degree of credit risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P </span><span>Global Ratings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</span></div> <div><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </span><span>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its </span><span>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>CFTC Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </span><span>investment exposure to such instruments.

To the extent a Fund uses CFTC </span><span>Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> or a </span><span>vehicle for trading such instruments.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 </span><span>under the CEA with respect to each Fund. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool </span><span>operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to </span><span>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Dodd-Frank Act</span><span>”</span><span>) in the U.S. and under </span><span>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other </span><span>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </span><span>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </span><span>of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </span><span>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </span><span>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of </span><span>“</span><span>senior securities</span><span>”</span><span> under Section 18 of the </span><span>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits open-end funds, </span><span>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </span><span>“</span><span>senior security,</span><span>”</span><span> other than borrowing from a bank (subject to a requirement </span><span>to maintain 300% </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span>). </span></div> <div><span>Under Rule 18f-4, </span><span>“</span><span>Derivatives Transactions</span><span>”</span><span> include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </span><span>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing, </span><span>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </span><span>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise; </span><span>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse</span><span> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </span><span>under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</span><span> (</span><span>“</span><span>TBA</span><span>”</span><span>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </span><span>physically settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the </span><span>“</span><span>Delayed-Settlement </span><span>Securities Provision</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below), the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </span><span>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</span><span>“</span><span>DRMP</span><span>”</span><span>) and comply with a relative or absolute limit on Fund </span><span>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</span><span>“</span><span>VaR</span><span>”</span><span>). The DRMP is administered by a </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives risk manager,</span><span>”</span><span> who is </span><span>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and </span><span>reports to the Board.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives exposure</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </span><span>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </span><span>“</span><span>Limited </span><span>Derivatives User Exception</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>The iShares iBonds 2023 Term High Yield and Income ETF, iShares iBonds 2024 Term High Yield and Income ETF, iShares </span><span>iBonds 2025 Term High Yield and Income ETF, iShares iBonds 2026 Term High Yield and Income ETF, iShares iBonds 2027 </span><span>Term High Yield and Income ETF, iShares iBonds 2029 Term High Yield and Income ETF and iShares iBonds Dec 2027 Term </span><span>Corporate ETF (the </span><span>“</span><span>No-Action Letter Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) may also have investments in </span><span>“</span><span>underlying funds</span><span>”</span><span> (and such underlying funds </span><span>themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term </span><span>“</span><span>underlying fund</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the no-action </span><span>letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate </span><span>investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>), business development companies and, investment companies that may invest in CFTC </span><span>Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have </span><span>transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of </span><span>transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in </span><span>such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay </span><span>registration as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim </span><span>with the CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or </span><span>regulation as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA in respect of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund or an </span><span>Underlying Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually </span><span>agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements </span><span>may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the </span><span>purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered </span><span>to be owned by a Fund or an Underlying Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase </span><span>price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with </span><span>the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund or an Underlying Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to </span><span>the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. Each Fund seeks to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent </span><span>legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral </span><span>with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter </span><span>maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate </span><span>than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the </span><span>counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund or an Underlying Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of </span><span>the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position a Fund or an Underlying Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its </span><span>investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the </span><span>shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund or an Underlying Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and </span><span>income involved in the transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund and each Underlying Fund may invest in the securities of other investment </span><span>companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff </span><span>guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) </span><span>3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to </span><span>any one investment company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. </span><span>To the extent allowed by law or regulation,</span><span> </span><span>the Funds and each Underlying Fund intend from time to time to invest their </span><span>assets in securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by </span><span>BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund </span><span>invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, </span><span>which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of </span><span>money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund </span><span>Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund's </span><span>pro rata </span><span>share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment </span><span>companies</span><span> </span><span>(as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>An Underlying Fund may purchase shares of ETFs for the same reason it would purchase (and as an alternative to </span><span>purchasing) futures contracts – to obtain relatively low-cost exposure to the stock market while maintaining flexibility to </span><span>meet the liquidity needs of the Underlying Fund. ETF shares enjoy several advantages over futures contracts. Depending on </span><span>the market, the holding period, and other factors, ETF shares can be less costly than futures contracts. In addition, ETF shares </span><span>can be purchased for smaller sums and offer exposure to market sectors and styles for which there is no suitable or liquid </span><span>futures contract. An Underlying Fund may also purchase ETF shares for other purposes, including improving its ability to </span><span>track its underlying index. An Underlying Fund may invest in shares of ETFs that are advised by BFA.</span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund and the Underlying Funds may invest in short-term </span><span>instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons.

Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time </span><span>deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. </span><span>Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international </span><span>transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>U.S.-Registered and Restricted Securities of Non-U.S. Issuers.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund may invest in U.S.-registered,</span><span> U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S. corporate issuers.

Investing in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds or Restricted </span><span>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers involves some risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. </span><span>issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect </span><span>U.S. investments in foreign countries; and potential restrictions of the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be </span><span>subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. In addition, the risk that the issuer may fail to meet its obligations </span><span>on these securities may be affected by fluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange rates between the issuer's local currency </span><span>and the U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in </span><span>such respects as growth of gross domestic product (</span><span>“</span><span>GDP</span><span>”</span><span>), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency </span><span>and balance of payment positions.</span></div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The board of each Fund may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and </span><span>investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with the Fund's </span><span>investment objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities, including its </span><span>investment in the Underlying Fund, may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the </span><span>portfolio securities, the value of bonds in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors </span><span>does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Call Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Funds or an Underlying Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and a Fund or an Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in </span><span>securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with </span><span>other less favorable features.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Custody Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of </span><span>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </span><span>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </span><span>hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </span><span>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </span><span>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of </span><span>security certificates.

Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than </span><span>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </span><span>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue </span><span>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </span><span>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </span><span>Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of </span><span>any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no </span><span>successful claim for compensation.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investment in Underlying Funds Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain Funds may under certain circumstances invest a substantial portion of their </span><span>assets in one or more Underlying Funds, in which case such Funds’ investment performance is likely to be directly related to </span><span>the performance of the Underlying Funds. A Fund may also invest in other funds, including money market funds. A Fund’s </span><span>NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Funds and other securities in which the Fund invests based on </span><span>their market valuations. An investment in a Fund that invests a substantial portion of its assets in one of more Underlying </span><span>Funds will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Funds. For example, </span><span>such a Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses (including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the </span><span>Underlying Funds.</span></div> <div><span>An investor in such a Fund may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the Underlying Funds, as well as taxable </span><span>gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Funds by the Fund. Certain of the Funds may also hold common portfolio </span><span>securities.</span></div> <div><span>As the Underlying Funds or a Fund’s allocations to the Underlying Funds change from time to time, or to the extent that the </span><span>expense ratio of the Underlying Funds changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by a Fund may increase or </span><span>decrease.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Issuer Insolvency Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund's and each Underlying Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled </span><span>issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or </span><span>recession. Should an issuer of securities held by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or </span><span>financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer </span><span>uncertain.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Funds will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund or the Underlying Funds will be </span><span>subject to significant uncertainty as to whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed, and each Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Funds may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Funds will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the </span><span>obligations evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by a Fund or the Underlying Funds will eventually be satisfied. Even </span><span>if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the </span><span>Underlying Funds, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by a Fund or the Underlying Funds in </span><span>connection with such plan of reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have </span><span>been anticipated or no value. A Fund or the Underlying Funds may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or </span><span>may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security </span><span>interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the </span><span>expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In </span><span>a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by a Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Funds could be re-characterized, or each Fund or the Underlying Funds may receive different securities or other assets, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock </span><span>(including convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock </span><span>purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. The value of equity securities received by </span><span>each Fund or the Underlying Funds could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and </span><span>economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. Equity securities received by a Fund </span><span>through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s </span><span>Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent that a Fund or the Underlying Funds receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, </span><span>reorganization or financial restructuring, a Fund or the Underlying Funds may also be subject to additional risks associated </span><span>with the assets received. One example of assets that a Fund or the Underlying Funds could receive is an interest in one or </span><span>more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Funds may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</span></div> <div><span>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments </span><span>in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or </span><span>downward pricing pressure after completion of the reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring </span><span>assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If a Fund or the Underlying Funds participates in </span><span>negotiations with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring with respect to securities of the issuer held by a Fund or </span><span>the Underlying Funds, each Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If a Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Funds becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund or the Underlying Funds may have more active </span><span>participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to </span><span>determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. A Fund’s investments may pay </span><span>interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A Fund may also obtain </span><span>financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a Fund may also reference LIBOR.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>FCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which regulates LIBOR announced </span><span>that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings and certain </span><span>other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (</span><span>“</span><span>EONIA</span><span>”</span><span>) ceased to be published after December 31, </span><span>2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight </span><span>collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>repo</span><span>”</span><span>) market and has been used increasingly on a </span><span>voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act was signed into </span><span>law in the U.S., providing a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate that is selected by the </span><span>Federal Reserve Board and based on SOFR for certain contracts that reference LIBOR without adequate fallback provisions. </span><span>On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate Act by </span><span>identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts after June 30, </span><span>2023.</span></div> <div><span>The regulations include provisions that (i) provide a safe harbor for selection or use of a replacement benchmark rate </span><span>selected by the Federal Reserve Board; (ii) clarify who may choose the replacement benchmark rate selected by the Federal </span><span>Reserve Board; and (iii) ensure that contracts adopting a replacement benchmark rate selected by the Federal Reserve Board </span><span>will not be interrupted or terminated following the replacement of LIBOR. These regulations apply only contracts governed by </span><span>U.S. law, among other limitations. Similar legislation and regulations have been and may be further adopted in other </span><span>jurisdictions.</span></div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. Not all existing LIBOR-based </span><span>instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability </span><span>of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing instruments. Parties to contracts, securities or other </span><span>instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the application of applicable transition regulations, potentially </span><span>resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund may have instruments linked to other </span><span>interbank offered rates and currencies that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> <div><span>The effect of these changes on a Fund will vary based on, among other things, existing fallback or termination provisions in </span><span>individual contracts and the potential renegotiation of existing contracts. In many cases, if an instrument falls back to an </span><span>alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative reference rate will not perform the same as LIBOR because the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>alternative reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive component in the rate calculation. In the event of a credit crisis, </span><span>floating rate instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those instruments using a </span><span>rate indexed to the interbank lending market.</span></div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their </span><span>occurrence or effects.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily </span><span>cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio </span><span>securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be </span><span>required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk </span><span>of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </span><span>invest.</span></div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to the </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </span><span>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Non-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the </span><span>respective countries covered by a Fund or an Underlying Fund. The risks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities typically </span><span>include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and </span><span>perceived trends in bond prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain </span><span>risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include securities </span><span>markets that may lack sufficient liquidity or may be less efficient; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available </span><span>information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of </span><span>funds or other assets of a Fund or an Underlying Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in </span><span>settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market </span><span>capitalization of most non-U.S. securities markets; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of </span><span>the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social, </span><span>economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and different bankruptcy and </span><span>insolvency regimes which may stay or prevent recovery in the event of an issuer’s default. </span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk. </span><span> </span><span>In certain circumstances, a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's securities may be valued using techniques other </span><span>than market quotations. The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use </span><span>of another methodology or if the value had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods </span><span>other than market quotations, including </span><span>“</span><span>fair valued</span><span>”</span><span> securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one </span><span>day to the next than would be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund and an </span><span>Underlying Fund could sell a security for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund or an </span><span>Underlying Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its established value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span><span>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</span><span> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span><span>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </span><span>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia </span><span>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and </span><span>flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand and affect the value of securities held by the Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on </span><span>trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading </span><span>countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in </span><span>the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a </span><span>result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of certain Central and South American countries have </span><span>experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high </span><span>unemployment rates and political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities </span><span>(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the regions and many economies in these </span><span>regions are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a </span><span>significant adverse effect on other countries of these regions.</span></div> <div><span>The governments of certain countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of </span><span>the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the </span><span>economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on the securities in which the Fund invests. </span><span>Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some </span><span>countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</span></div> <div><span>Certain countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have </span><span>been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative </span><span>currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These </span><span>countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they </span><span>trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which the Fund invests may be the </span><span>subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and </span><span>the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. </span><span>government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An </span><span>issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. The Fund may </span><span>be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </span><span> </span><span>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </span><span>investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </span><span>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </span><span>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </span><span>regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors </span><span>and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local </span><span>governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be </span><span>subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar payments imposed by local </span><span>governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there may </span><span>be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the </span><span>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </span><span>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </span><span>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </span><span>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not </span><span>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </span><span>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </span><span>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </span><span>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </span><span>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </span><span>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </span><span>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </span><span>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </span><span>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </span><span>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the </span><span>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </span><span>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in </span><span>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </span><span>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio </span><span>securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption </span><span>requests.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </span><span>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </span><span>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </span><span>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </span><span>“</span><span>sovereign</span><span>”</span><span> assets. Certain emerging market </span><span>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </span><span>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </span><span>These restrictions may limit a Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may </span><span>increase the expenses of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval </span><span>prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's </span><span>outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than </span><span>securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </span><span>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </span><span>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </span><span>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </span><span>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </span><span>imposition of trade barriers.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to </span><span>applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such </span><span>countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there </span><span>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </span><span>difficult to conduct such transactions.</span></div> <div><span>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </span><span>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </span><span>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </span><span>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </span><span>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these </span><span>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </span><span>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary </span><span>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </span><span>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of </span><span>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </span><span>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </span><span>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </span><span>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </span><span>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on </span><span>inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect </span><span>every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in </span><span>the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or </span><span>threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may </span><span>have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain </span><span>European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </span><span>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit </span><span>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </span><span>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected </span><span>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </span><span>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European </span><span>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further </span><span>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>The United Kingdom (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or </span><span>worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </span><span>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </span><span>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may </span><span>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </span><span>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact </span><span>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect </span><span>the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in North America. </span><span> </span><span>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </span><span>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </span><span>all of the North American countries in which</span><span> </span><span>a Fund or certain of the Underlying Funds invest. </span></div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade </span><span>Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has </span><span>increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of </span><span>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could </span><span>negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and </span><span>legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value </span><span>of certain securities held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund. </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in </span><span>the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend </span><span>heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic </span><span>expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, </span><span>worsening business cash flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, </span><span>corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in </span><span>interest rates, corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such </span><span>companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </span><span>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, </span><span>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </span><span>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </span><span>products and services due to technological advancement.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services </span><span>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </span><span>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer </span><span>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span></div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of </span><span>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </span><span>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </span><span>world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </span><span>communications services industry can also be significantly affected by intense competition for market share, including </span><span>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, </span><span>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </span><span>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the </span><span>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </span><span>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to </span><span>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may </span><span>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory </span><span>oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be </span><span>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </span><span>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </span></div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, </span><span>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential </span><span>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. </span><span>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </span><span>downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </span><span>less revenue.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily </span><span>on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail </span><span>companies, and housing-related companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, </span><span>including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer </span><span>tastes and trends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor </span><span>relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government </span><span>regulation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of </span><span>global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation </span><span>efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These </span><span>companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt </span><span>and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global </span><span>economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its </span><span>investment.</span></div> <div><span>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate </span><span>significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, </span><span>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and </span><span>between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade </span><span>sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices </span><span>have recently been subject to increased volatility, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For </span><span>example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on </span><span>the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility </span><span>occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of certain crude oil </span><span>futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by terrorism, war, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other </span><span>catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may </span><span>significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries </span><span>where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. </span><span>Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently </span><span>experienced widespread social unrest.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic </span><span>conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and </span><span>world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and </span><span>property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, </span><span>violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively </span><span>small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget </span><span>constraints may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly </span><span>regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their </span><span>operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter </span><span>laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and </span><span>may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector. Energy companies may have </span><span>relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than companies in other sectors to restructure their businesses during </span><span>economic downturns or adversity in global energy markets.</span></div> <div><span>Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the </span><span>energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain </span><span>commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. and certain European countries have announced bans or restrictions on </span><span>imports of hydrocarbon commodities from Russia. The effect of such bans and any similar restrictions by other countries, as </span><span>well as the extent, scope and duration of the conflict, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy </span><span>sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments </span><span>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, </span><span>securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial </span><span>conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general </span><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and </span><span>cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the </span><span>value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial </span><span>companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest </span><span>rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </span><span>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely </span><span>affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, </span><span>product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Insurance Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some </span><span>countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing </span><span>competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments </span><span>of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up </span><span>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or </span><span>declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </span><span>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. </span><span>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </span><span>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </span><span>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise </span><span>provided to you.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Transportation Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the transportation industry may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the economy, increases in fuel and operating costs, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, </span><span>insurance costs, industry competition and government regulation. Companies in the transportation industry are also affected </span><span>by severe weather events, mass casualty accidents or environmental catastrophes, acts of terrorism and other similar events </span><span>that target or damage transportation infrastructure or vessels, war or risk of war, widespread disruption of technology </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>systems and increasing equipment and operational costs. Such global or regional events and conditions may adversely affect </span><span>the operations, financial condition and liquidity of companies in the transportation industry and cause insurance premiums </span><span>to increase dramatically or result in insurance coverage becoming unavailable for certain business lines or assets. Securities </span><span>of companies in the transportation industry are generally cyclical and occasionally subject to sharp price movements.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </span><span> </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, </span><span>times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the </span><span>U.S. government may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ </span><span>by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury </span><span>obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing </span><span>arrangements, a downgrade could also result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the </span><span>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and global economy.</span></div> <div><span>A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost </span><span>higher and lead the government to issue additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises </span><span>concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. If market </span><span>participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could decline, </span><span>thus increasing inflationary pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported </span><span>goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic </span><span>downturns. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </span><span>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period that </span><span>shareholders own shares of a Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of </span><span>the U.S., circumstances could arise that would prevent the timely payment of interest or principal, which would result in </span><span>losses to a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </span><span>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures </span><span>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </span><span>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </span><span>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </span><span>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident </span><span>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </span><span>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further </span><span>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix A.</span></div> <div><span>Information with respect to how proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period </span><span>ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' </span><span>website at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>On each Business Day (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI), prior to the opening </span><span>of regular trading on the Fund’s primary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on its website (</span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>) certain </span><span>information relating to the portfolio holdings that will form the basis of a Fund’s next net asset value per share calculation.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain information may also be made available to certain parties:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Communications of Data Files: </span><span>A Fund may make available through the facilities of the National Securities Clearing </span><span>Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>NSCC</span><span>”</span><span>) or through posting on the </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>, prior to the opening of trading on each business </span><span>day, a list of a Fund’s holdings (generally pro-rata) that Authorized Participants could deliver to a Fund to settle </span><span>purchases of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Deposit Securities) or that Authorized Participants would receive from a Fund to settle </span><span>redemptions of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Fund Securities).

A vote of a majority of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in the Investment Company Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the </span><span>voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of </span><span>the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund </span><span>has also adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental </span><span>investment policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Therefore, each Fund may change its </span><span>investment objective and its Underlying Index without shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund may not:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span></div> <div><span>Concentrate its investments in a particular industry, as that term is used in the Investment Company Act, except that </span><span>the Fund will concentrate to approximately the same extent that its Underlying Index concentrates in the securities of a </span><span>particular industry or group of industries.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span></div> <div><span>Borrow money, except as permitted under the Investment Company Act.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span></div> <div><span>Issue senior securities to the extent such issuance would violate the Investment Company Act.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase or hold real estate, except the Fund may purchase and hold securities or other instruments that are secured </span><span>by, or linked to, real estate or interests therein, securities of REITs, mortgage-related securities and securities of issuers </span><span>engaged in the real estate business, and the Fund may purchase and hold real estate as a result of the ownership of </span><span>securities or other instruments.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5.</span></div> <div><span>Underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the sale of portfolio securities by the Fund may be </span><span>deemed to be an underwriting or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, except as permitted by the Investment Company Act.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7.</span></div> <div><span>Make loans to the extent prohibited by the Investment Company Act.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Notations Regarding each</span><span> </span><span>Fund’s Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> <div><span>The following notations are not considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to </span><span>change without shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does </span><span>not define what constitutes </span><span>“</span><span>concentration</span><span>”</span><span> in an industry. The Commission staff has taken the position that investment of </span><span>25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group </span><span>of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The </span><span>policy in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy </span><span>also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies </span><span>or instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>48</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to the Fund’s industry classifications, the </span><span>Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market </span><span>indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad </span><span>authority to the Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits the Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and </span><span>to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets </span><span>include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires the </span><span>Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means </span><span>the ratio that the value of the Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, </span><span>bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or </span><span>involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4 under the </span><span>Investment Company Act, when the Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions, the </span><span>Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in </span><span>the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to such </span><span>transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to </span><span>securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve </span><span>leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the Securities Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the Securities Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by </span><span>applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit the Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, Commission staff interpretations currently </span><span>prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the </span><span>purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to </span><span>options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the </span><span>settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</span></div> <div><span>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short </span><span>position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, </span><span>under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment </span><span>purposes, in the component securities of its respective Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its </span><span>shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, an 80% </span><span>requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance </span><span>with this policy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>49</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </span><span>extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase shares of any </span><span>registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </span><span>“</span><span>fund of funds</span><span>”</span><span> provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each Fund has knowledge that its shares are </span><span>purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</span></div> <div><span>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply </span><span>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </span><span>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not </span><span>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </span><span>without undue market or tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </span><span>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</span></div> <div><span>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</span><span>  </span><span>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. </span><span>Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee.

(collectively </span><span>referred to in this section as </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </span><span>and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>77</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>78</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>79</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </span><span>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for </span><span>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </span><span>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by </span><span>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>80</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>81</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>82</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>83</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </span><span>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </span><span>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that </span><span>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </span><span>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> <div><span>The custody arrangement described in </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span><span> may lead to potential </span><span>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses </span><span>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </span><span>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </span><span>balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </span><span>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </span><span>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions </span><span>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </span><span>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or </span><span>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </span><span>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </span><span>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>84</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </span><span>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may </span><span>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </span><span>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost </span><span>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </span><span>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of </span><span>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </span><span>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</span></div> <div><span>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund Operating </span><span>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be </span><span>eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to each Fund, BFA received a management fee at the annual rates (as a percentage of </span><span>such Fund’s average net assets) set forth below for the fiscal years noted:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and </span><span>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </span><span>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by </span><span>investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </span><span>BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including </span><span>the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, </span><span>educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (</span><span>“</span><span>Education </span><span>Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials </span><span>relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (</span><span>“</span><span>Publishing Costs</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA Entities </span><span>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </span><span>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as </span><span>revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> <div><span>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </span><span>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </span><span>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </span><span>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </span><span>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </span><span>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its </span><span>customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and </span><span>BlackRock mutual funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education </span><span>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>FBS</span><span>”</span><span>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span><span>Management, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, </span><span>Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings, Inc., Raymond </span><span>James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Stash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells </span><span>Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to </span><span>Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>104</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </span><span>Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </span><span>by a Fund is as follows:</span></div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Fixed-Income Investments. </span><span>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued </span><span>using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available bid prices </span><span>or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved </span><span>independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data </span><span>(</span><span>e.g</span><span>., recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other </span><span>relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable </span><span>quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and </span><span>assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round </span><span>lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than </span><span>institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days </span><span>or less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including </span><span>asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash </span><span>flows of each tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the </span><span>benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</span></div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>105</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>107</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> <div><span>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on </span><span>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of </span><span>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </span><span>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. American Depositary Receipts, like other </span><span>securities traded in the U.S., will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</span></div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>108</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> <div><span>There were no brokerage commissions paid on behalf of each Fund for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, October 31, </span><span>2021 and October 31, 2020.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>109</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Shares have no preemptive, exchange, </span><span>subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and </span><span>distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on </span><span>liquidation.</span></div> <div><span>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to </span><span>shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote </span><span>together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than </span><span>one fund.</span></div> <div><span>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the </span><span>1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 </span><span>Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under </span><span>Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of </span><span>trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a </span><span>“</span><span>control person</span><span>”</span><span> of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 </span><span>Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, </span><span>Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a </span><span>fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In </span><span>addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial </span><span>owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (</span><span>“</span><span>Insiders</span><span>”</span><span>) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale </span><span>provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should </span><span>consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing </span><span>guidance provided by the SEC staff.</span></div> <div><span>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the </span><span>“</span><span>Declaration of Trust</span><span>”</span><span>), the Board may, </span><span>without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, </span><span>including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or </span></div> <div><span>take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</span><span>  </span><span>The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the </span><span>Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on </span><span>termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is </span><span>required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of </span><span>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </span><span>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </span><span>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a </span><span>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </span><span>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </span><span>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</span></div> <div><span>By March 31 and December 15 of the relevant year, each Fund's holdings are expected to consist primarily of cash and cash </span><span>equivalents. Around the same time, the Fund will wind up and terminate. Upon a Fund's termination, it will distribute </span><span>substantially all of its net assets, after making appropriate provision for any liabilities of the Fund, to then-current </span><span>shareholders pursuant to a plan of liquidation. In accordance with the Declaration of Trust, each Fund will terminate on or </span><span>about the date above, as approved by a majority of the Board, without requiring additional shareholder approval.

The common stock of DTCC is </span><span>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </span><span>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </span><span>referred to herein as </span><span>“</span><span>Beneficial Owners</span><span>”</span><span>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </span><span>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect </span><span>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </span><span>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </span><span>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span><span>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </span><span>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any </span><span>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </span><span>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </span><span>cost.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </span><span>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized </span><span>Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such </span><span>initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration </span><span>statement for each Fund (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>Selling Shareholder</span><span>”</span><span>), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to </span><span>time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these </span><span>shares.</span></div> <div><span>Selling Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on </span><span>any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in </span><span>the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the </span><span>time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected through </span><span>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or </span><span>through any other means authorized by applicable law.

Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the </span><span>“</span><span>Fund Deposit,</span><span>”</span><span> which, when combined with a Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and </span><span>subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of a Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as </span><span>described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund </span><span>Deposit is made available.</span></div> <div><span>The Cash Component is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </span><span>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </span><span>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </span><span>Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>As the planned termination date of each Fund approaches, and particularly as the bonds held by each Fund begin to mature, </span><span>the Fund expects to effect both creations and redemptions increasingly for cash.</span></div> <div><span>The identity and number or par value of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's </span><span>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to </span><span>the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments </span><span>to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities </span><span>portion of the Fund Deposit through </span><span>“</span><span>systematic rounding.</span><span>”</span><span> The rounding methodology </span><span>“</span><span>rounds up</span><span>”</span><span> position sizes of </span><span>securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum </span><span>allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</span></div> <div><span>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for </span><span>index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any </span><span>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </span><span>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when </span><span>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </span><span>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an </span><span>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </span><span>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</span></div> <div><span>Cash Purchase Method. </span><span> </span><span>Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its </span><span>funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected in </span><span>essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized </span><span>Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind</span><span> purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </span><span>the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a </span><span>“</span><span>Participating Party,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>i.e</span><span>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process </span><span>through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Clearing Process</span><span>”</span><span>), a clearing agency that is registered </span><span>with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations </span><span>and redemptions of Creation Units (</span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>) (discussed below). A member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant.</span><span>”</span><span> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede </span><span>&amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>116</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Such Authorized </span><span>Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor </span><span>on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of </span><span>each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next </span><span>determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An </span><span>Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such </span><span>Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not </span><span>Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that </span><span>orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a </span><span>result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust </span><span>does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list </span><span>of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding </span><span>Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines </span><span>set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection </span><span>with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized </span><span>Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Placement of Creation Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. </span><span>government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such </span><span>as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a </span><span>“</span><span>Central Depository Account</span><span>”</span><span>). Any portion of a </span><span>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central </span><span>Depository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely </span><span>fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Funds </span><span>generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve </span><span>System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite </span><span>number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of the Funds generally </span><span>before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account </span><span>must be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository </span><span>Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The </span><span>“</span><span>Settlement Date</span><span>”</span><span> for all funds is generally the </span><span>second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the </span><span>validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the </span><span>Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred </span><span>directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State </span><span>Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are </span><span>not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to </span><span>the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly </span><span>constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no </span><span>later than the second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, </span><span>provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the Funds prior to such time.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </span><span>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </span><span>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </span><span>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time </span><span>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </span><span>such Business Day.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>117</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of </span><span>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash </span><span>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</span></div> <div><span>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </span><span>of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders </span><span>must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to </span><span>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </span><span>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each </span><span>Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The </span><span>Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an </span><span>Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via </span><span>communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. </span><span>Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined </span><span>after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and </span><span>disclosed in this SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </span><span>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </span><span>as set forth below.</span></div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </span><span>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </span><span>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them </span><span>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are </span><span>generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date).

Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date.

If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </span><span>of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in </span><span>certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may </span><span>be charged a fee for such services.</span></div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard creation transaction fees and maximum additional charge (as described </span><span>above):</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until such time as the </span><span>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </span><span>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to </span><span>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </span><span>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </span><span>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being </span><span>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </span><span>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but the Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation </span><span>Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs </span><span>from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified </span><span>to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through </span><span>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded </span><span>up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the </span><span>Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to </span><span>reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>120</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized </span><span>Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus </span><span>the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </span><span>relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </span><span>Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized </span><span>Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </span><span>of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Placement of Redemption Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the </span><span>Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable </span><span>request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that </span><span>day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation </span><span>Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for </span><span>a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current </span><span>Authorized Participants upon request.</span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or </span><span>its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </span><span>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </span><span>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </span><span>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such </span><span>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </span><span>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A redemption request is considered to be in </span><span>“</span><span>proper form</span><span>”</span><span> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </span><span>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </span><span>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a </span><span>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </span><span>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set </span><span>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</span></div> <div><span>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer </span><span>agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities </span><span>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </span><span>the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC </span><span>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </span><span>Participant submitting the redemption request.</span></div> <div><span>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain </span><span>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </span><span>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</span></div> <div><span>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund are generally made within two Business Days (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>T+2</span><span>”</span><span>). Each Fund </span><span>reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2, if necessary or appropriate under the </span><span>circumstances and compliant with applicable law. If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market </span><span>holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming </span><span>Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, a Fund may </span><span>delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as </span><span>practicable, but in no event later than 15 days. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, including, </span><span>without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link distribution </span><span>to dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption settlement process may </span><span>be extended beyond T+2 because of the occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a </span><span>holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date </span><span>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </span><span>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>122</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The </span><span>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </span><span>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </span><span>Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </span><span>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </span><span>for related brokerage and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </span><span>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </span><span>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by </span><span>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period </span><span>during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during </span><span>which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a </span><span>result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably </span><span>practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</span></div> <div><span>Custom Baskets.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund will accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> A custom basket </span><span>may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio </span><span>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </span><span>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes</span></div> <div><span>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </span><span>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and </span><span>non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. </span><span>References to a Fund will also generally apply to an Underlying Fund as well.</span></div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC </span><span>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at </span><span>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>123</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s </span><span>annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </span><span>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from </span><span>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </span><span>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, partnerships that are traded on an </span><span>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of its </span><span>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </span><span>quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </span><span>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities </span><span>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </span><span>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </span><span>value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or </span><span>more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related </span><span>trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </span><span>partnerships.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> <div><span>Although in general the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in </span><span>partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S.</span><span> income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the </span><span>dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its </span><span>capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that </span><span>doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such </span><span>income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and </span><span>profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than </span><span>two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the </span><span>excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to </span><span>such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Funds, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The following Funds had tax basis net capital loss carryforwards as set forth in the table below as of October 31, 2022, the </span><span>tax year-end for the Funds listed:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>124</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </span><span>Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or capital gain </span><span>distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of </span><span>record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of </span><span>such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually </span><span>paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment </span><span>company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses </span><span>(including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net </span><span>long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject </span><span>to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as </span><span>undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income </span><span>tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit </span><span>their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax </span><span>liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to </span><span>increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount </span><span>in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital </span><span>gains will be entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or </span><span>claims for refund with the IRS.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term</span><span> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </span><span>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings </span><span>and profits (</span><span>“</span><span>regular dividends</span><span>”</span><span>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for </span><span>taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds </span><span>certain threshold amounts.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </span><span>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>126</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase </span><span>or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</span></div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Sales of Shares.</span><span>  </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a </span><span>family of mutual funds.</span></div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>127</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </span><span>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC. </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any </span><span>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </span><span>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a </span><span>Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital </span><span>assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be </span><span>treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, </span><span>regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund. </span></div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. Each Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </span><span>more than one year). The cost of any payments made by a Fund on a swap transaction will be netted </span><span>pro rata</span><span> against both </span><span>tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize </span><span>income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps </span><span>to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> <div><span>Market Discount. </span><span> </span><span>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a </span><span>bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue </span><span>discount (</span><span>“</span><span>OID</span><span>”</span><span>). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s </span><span>disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued </span><span>market discount.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by certain of the Funds from investments in </span><span>non-U.S. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between </span><span>certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of a Fund’s total assets at </span><span>the close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect for U.S. income tax purposes </span><span>to treat non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, </span><span>but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to make an election, shareholders of the Fund would be required to </span><span>take into account an amount equal to their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and </span><span>then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax deduction or as a foreign tax credit against </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>128</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, a Fund will report to its </span><span>shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included in each shareholder’s gross income </span><span>and the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a </span><span>shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the extent to which the credit (but not </span><span>the deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed. Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses </span><span>attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other </span><span>liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time the Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are </span><span>generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be </span><span>treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the </span><span>currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gain or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated </span><span>in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition </span><span>dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless a Fund were to elect otherwise.</span></div> <div><span>The Underlying Funds, if invested in non-U.S. positions, may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes and non-U.S. financial </span><span>transactions taxes. Each Underlying Fund that is permitted to do so may elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to its investors, including the </span><span>Funds, the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Underlying Fund. Each Fund itself will be eligible to elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> such amounts to its stockholders and may do so, depending upon circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>Original Issue Discount. </span><span> </span><span>OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder </span><span>of the bond. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such </span><span>bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive </span><span>inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. </span><span>The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the </span><span>general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s </span><span>taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need </span><span>to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The amount of negative inflation adjustment, which </span><span>results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, </span><span>interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable </span><span>year.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting.</span><span>  </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest </span><span>and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>129</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term capital </span><span>gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable </span><span>year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as </span><span>such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as </span><span>ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S. </span><span>shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </span><span>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </span><span>rules to their accounts.</span></div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests.

To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will </span><span>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, </span><span>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence </span><span>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </span><span>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to </span><span>account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information as to their account </span><span>holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, </span><span>provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </span><span>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the </span><span>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</span></div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders </span><span>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </span><span>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they </span><span>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </span><span>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws. </span><span>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </span><span>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of </span><span>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </span><span>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps achieve this balance.</span></div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </span><span>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </span><span>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </span><span>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </span><span>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </span><span>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</span><span>1</span><span> We also contribute to </span><span>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </span><span>long-term shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and </span><span>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </span><span>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where </span><span>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </span><span>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </span><span>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </span><span>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </span><span>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </span><span>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </span><span>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </span><span>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </span><span>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </span><span>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </span><span>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </span><span>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </span><span>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </span><span>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </span><span>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</span></div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more accessible for investors in separate accounts and </span><span>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in </span><span>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </span><span>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </span><span>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a company’s ability to </span><span>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </span><span>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the </span><span>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </span><span>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>These Principles cover seven key themes:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Our regional and market-specific </span><span>voting guidelines</span><span> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </span><span>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </span><span>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </span><span>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </span><span>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and </span><span>impactful responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </span><span>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</span><span>2</span><span> as well as the </span><span>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </span><span>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </span><span>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </span><span>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </span><span>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </span><span>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </span><span>mitigated.</span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </span><span>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </span><span>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </span><span>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In </span><span>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Supporting and overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </span><span>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address anticipated or actual obstacles to success</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use, waste </span><span>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </span><span>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </span><span>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </span><span>component of a sound governance framework.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

While we consider these principles to be </span><span>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and </span><span>regulations.</span></div> <div><span>Regular accountability</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</span><span> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </span><span>timely manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the </span><span>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </span><span>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </span><span>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the </span><span>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage </span><span>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </span><span>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a </span><span>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</span></div> <div><span>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence </span><span>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </span><span>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and their shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </span><span>contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating new directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </span><span>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board composition. </span><span>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </span><span>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics </span><span>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </span><span>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and </span><span>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </span><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>4</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees </span><span>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </span><span>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, </span><span>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </span><span>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance </span><span>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </span><span>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </span><span>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee those functions.</span></div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </span><span>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </span><span>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to </span><span>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately </span><span>managing risk.</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle </span><span>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </span><span>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</span></div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</span></div> <div><span>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal </span><span>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </span><span>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while </span><span>minimizing costs to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </span><span>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </span><span>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </span><span>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </span><span>a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </span><span>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies </span><span>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </span><span>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </span><span>guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </span><span>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </span><span>market practice.</span></div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>outperformance against peer firms.</span></div> <div><span>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </span><span>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </span><span>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span></div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </span><span>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </span><span>or structures.</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </span><span>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related </span><span>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </span><span>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures are inadequate.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </span><span>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </span><span>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

SASB’s industry-specific </span><span>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs) </span><span>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </span><span>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality </span><span>of these issues for many businesses.</span><span>6</span><span> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </span><span>be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </span><span>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div><span>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various </span><span>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </span><span>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </span><span>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and </span><span>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </span><span>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </span><span>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and </span><span>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </span><span>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help </span><span>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</span></div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </span><span>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </span><span>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term </span><span>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </span><span>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>7</span><span> It is, of course, up to each company to define </span><span>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>8</span><span> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>9</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.

We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </span><span>basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </span><span>risk.</span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> <div><span>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent to </span><span>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </span><span>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business </span><span>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </span><span>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse </span><span>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </span><span>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </span><span>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </span><span>strategy and purpose.</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </span><span>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </span><span>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Form</span></div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>10</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </span><span>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </span><span>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </span><span>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </span><span>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </span><span>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </span><span>others.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </span><span>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </span><span>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </span><span>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</span></div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </span><span>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </span><span>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </span><span>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support </span><span>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </span><span>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </span><span>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </span><span>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </span><span>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how </span><span>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </span><span>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </span><span>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and </span><span>advise on amendments to BIS proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (Guidelines). The </span><span>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </span><span>(Global Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment </span><span>teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior executives </span><span>with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </span><span>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and the Guidelines.</span></div> <div><span>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including </span><span>maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on </span><span>corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important </span><span>developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and </span><span>performs oversight of those third parties.

The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </span><span>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </span><span>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </span><span>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </span><span>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </span><span>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </span><span>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </span><span>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote </span><span>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </span><span>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </span><span>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </span><span>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because </span><span>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform </span><span>manner.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </span><span>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees.

Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </span><span>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </span><span>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </span><span>and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting </span><span>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance </span><span>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </span><span>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </span><span>BlackRock uses an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </span><span>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an independent voting service provider to </span><span>make proxy voting recommendations for:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </span><span>the board of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock Funds</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent voting </span><span>service provider</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </span><span>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the </span><span>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned </span><span>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </span><span>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the </span><span>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending</span></div> <div><span>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </span><span>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our </span><span>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </span><span>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in </span><span>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </span><span>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> <div><span>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is based on an </span><span>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </span><span>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall </span><span>consideration).</span><span>12</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </span><span>the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span></div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </span><span>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a </span><span>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh </span><span>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </span><span>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </span><span>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</span></div> <div><span>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a </span><span>NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the </span><span>ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a </span><span>particular subsequent date.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>NRSROs may rate specific investments (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds), issuers (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) </span><span>and/or programs (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, commercial paper programs). However, certain types of investments may not be rated by NRSROs, </span><span>such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial </span><span>institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury </span><span>securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s </span><span>issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same </span><span>NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal </span><span>securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings for the same security (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>underlying,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>insured</span><span>”</span><span> and/or </span><span>“</span><span>enhanced</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</span></div> <div><span>New issue securities (regardless of type) may not be rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary </span><span>prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities may include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the </span><span>underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase </span><span>a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: </span><span>(i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s </span><span>rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect </span><span>to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria </span><span>as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined </span><span>by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may </span><span>differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are </span><span>not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index </span><span>methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, </span><span>following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or </span><span>restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fixed-income securities which are unrated may expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay </span><span>principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the </span><span>investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investors should note that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent </span><span>developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</span></div> <div><span>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and short-term obligations of an issuer.</span></div> <div><span>Moody’s Ratings</span></div> <div><span>Long-Term Obligations</span></div> <div><span>Aaa:</span><span> Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</span></div> <div><span>Aa:</span><span> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A:</span><span> Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Baa:</span><span> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess </span><span>certain speculative characteristics.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are </span><span>designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation.</span></div> <div><span>MIG 1:</span><span> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly </span><span>reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.</span></div> <div><span>MIG 2:</span><span> This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the </span><span>preceding group.</span></div> <div><span>MIG 3:</span><span> This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market </span><span>access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>SG:</span><span> This designation denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins </span><span>of protection.</span></div> <div><span>S&amp;P Global Ratings</span></div> <div><span>Long-Term Obligations</span></div> <div><span>AAA:</span><span> An obligation rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its </span><span>financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>AA:</span><span> An obligation rated AA differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet </span><span>its financial commitment is very strong.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A:</span><span> An obligation rated A is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic </span><span>conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on </span><span>the obligation is still strong.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BBB:</span><span> An obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing </span><span>circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the </span><span>obligation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:</span><span> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. </span><span>BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and </span><span>protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BB:</span><span> An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing </span><span>uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate </span><span>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>B:</span><span> An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the </span><span>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely </span><span>impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>CCC:</span><span> An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, </span><span>and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse </span><span>business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on </span><span>the obligation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>CC:</span><span> An obligation rated CC is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet </span><span>occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</span></div> <div><span>C:</span><span> An obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative </span><span>seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</span></div> <div><span>D:</span><span> An obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating </span><span>category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that </span><span>such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the </span><span>stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </span><span>of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </span><span>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</span></div> <div><span>NR:</span><span> NR indicates no rating has been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P </span><span>Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</span></div> <div><span>Note:</span><span> The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing </span><span>within the major rating categories.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Obligations</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-1: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet </span><span>its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign </span><span>(+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</span></div> <div><span>A-2: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and </span><span>economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial </span><span>commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.</span></div> <div><span>A-3: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or </span><span>changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on </span><span>the obligation.</span></div> <div><span>B: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor </span><span>currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead </span><span>to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</span></div> <div><span>C: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, </span><span>financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</span></div> <div><span>D: </span><span>A short-term obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D </span><span>rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes </span><span>that such payments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business </span><span>days will be treated as five business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </span><span>of a similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </span><span>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</span></div> <div><span>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</span></div> <div><span>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks </span><span>unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more </span><span>than three years will most likely receive a long-term debt rating.</span></div> <div><span>SP-1:</span><span> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service </span><span>is given a plus (+) designation.</span></div> <div><span>SP-2:</span><span> Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes </span><span>over the term of the notes.</span></div> <div><span>SP-3:</span><span> Speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.</span></div> <div><span>Fitch Ratings</span></div> <div><span>Long-Term Obligations</span></div> <div><span>AAA:</span><span> Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of </span><span>exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected </span><span>by foreseeable events.</span></div> <div><span>AA:</span><span> Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for </span><span>payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</span></div> <div><span>A:</span><span> High credit quality. A ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is </span><span>considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is </span><span>the case for higher ratings.</span></div> <div><span>BBB:</span><span> Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of </span><span>financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this </span><span>capacity.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BB:</span><span> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in </span><span>business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial </span><span>commitments to be met.</span></div> <div><span>B:</span><span> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</span></div> <div><span>CCC:</span><span> Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</span></div> <div><span>CC:</span><span> Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>C:</span><span> Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</span></div> <div><span>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, </span><span>depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have </span><span>comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</span></div> <div><span>Note: The modifiers </span><span>“</span><span>+</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>-</span><span>”</span><span> may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such </span><span>suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories </span><span>below CCC.</span></div> <div><span>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The </span><span>designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant </span><span>to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for </span><span>analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to </span><span>market risk.</span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</span></div> <div><span>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or </span><span>security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the </span><span>relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as </span><span>“</span><span>short-term</span><span>”</span><span> based on </span><span>market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 </span><span>months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</span></div> <div><span>F1:</span><span> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; </span><span>may have an added </span><span>“</span><span>+</span><span>”</span><span> to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</span></div> <div><span>F2:</span><span> Good short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</span></div> <div><span>F3:</span><span> Fair short-term credit quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</span></div> <div><span>B:</span><span> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened </span><span>vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</span></div> <div><span>C:</span><span> High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.</span></div> <div><span>RD:</span><span> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it </span><span>continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings only.</span></div> <div><span>D:</span><span> Default. Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</span></div> <div><span>IS-SAI-10-1123</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> </body></html>
