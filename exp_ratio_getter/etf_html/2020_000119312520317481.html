subset of the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Market Extended Index, a broad market index representing the top 99.5% of U.S. equity market
capitalization. To be eligible for inclusion in the Morningstar US Market Extended Index, a stock must be listed on the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities, or NASDAQ, domiciled in the U.S. or have its primary stock market activities carried out in the
U.S., have sufficient historical fundamental data available so that Morningstar can classify investment style, and be in the top 75% of companies in the investable universe based on its liquidity score. A security’s liquidity score is based on
its average monthly trading volume in U.S. dollars. American Depository Receipts (“ADRs), American Depositary Shares, fixed-dividend shares, convertible notes, warrants, rights, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, bank holding
companies and royalty and statutory trusts are not eligible for inclusion in the US Market Extended Index. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Except for Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Dividend and Buyback Index, Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index, and Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, the
Morningstar Underlying Indexes are part of the Morningstar US Style Index family, which is based on the same methodology as the well-known Morningstar Style Box<font size="1"><sup>™</sup></font>. The Morningstar Style Box<font size="1"><sup>™</sup></font>
classification of each stock relies on prospective financial performance metrics – expressed as a yield (i.e., revenue yield, cash flow yield, dividend yield, and book value yield) and the per-share growth rate of each such metric – as
derived from Morningstar’s proprietary models, and (when available) the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (“IBES”) forecast of each stock’s current year earnings per share and the IBES median long-term earnings growth
forecast. The Morningstar Indexes are governed by transparent, objective rules for security selection, exclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for corporate actions. Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar”) makes no subjective determinations
related to index composition. </font></p>
