    On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext acquired the American
    Stock Exchange LLC which was renamed “NYSE Alternext
    US”. As the listing and trading of all exchange traded
    funds on NYSE Euronext is being consolidated on a single trading
    venue, NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”), the Sponsor and
    the Trustee, State Street Bank and Trust Company, have
    therefore decided to move the listing for the Trust from NYSE
    Alternext US to NYSE Arca, and have amended the Standard Terms
    and Conditions of Trust to permit the change of listing venue
    for the Trust.

<div>
    The listing transition process requires the formal withdrawal of
    listing of the Trust from NYSE Alternext US, and the new listing
    of the Trust on NYSE Arca. The Trust intends to commence the
    listing on NYSE Arca on or about February 24, 2009. Upon
    the change of listing, all references to “the
    Exchange” in the Prospectus will refer to NYSE Arca.
