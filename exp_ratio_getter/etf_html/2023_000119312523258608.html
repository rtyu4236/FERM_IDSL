<div><font>The iShares LifePath Target Date 2060 ETF (the
</font><font>“</font><font>2060 Fund</font><font>”</font><font> or the </font><font>“</font><font>Fund</font><font>”</font><font>) seeks to provide retirement outcomes through exposure to a </font><font>broad portfolio of ETFs which adjusts its allocation as it approaches its target date.</font></div> <div><font>Fees and Expenses</font></div> <div><font>The
following table describes the fees and expenses that you will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment </font><font>advisory agreement between iShares Trust

<div> <div><font>BFA employs a multi-dimensional approach to
assess risk for the </font><font>2060 Fund and to determine its allocation across asset classes. </font><font>As part of this
multi-dimensional approach, BFA aims to quantify </font><font>risk using proprietary risk measurement tools that, among other </font><font>things, analyze historical and forward-looking securities market </font><font>data, including risk, asset class correlations, and
expected </font><font>returns. Under normal circumstances, the 2060 Fund intends to </font><font>invest primarily in affiliated
exchange-traded funds
(</font><font>“</font><font>ETFs</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> <div><font>The 2060 Fund will invest, under normal
circumstances, at least </font><font>80% of its assets in securities or other financial instruments that </font><font>are components
of or have economic characteristics similar to the </font><font>securities included in its custom model benchmark, the 2060 </font><font>Target Date Custom Benchmark. BFA will not publish its custom </font><font>benchmark but will apply a proprietary model to monitor
</font><font>performance of the 2060 Fund. The 2060 Fund is designed for </font><font>investors expecting to retire or to begin
withdrawing assets </font><font>around the year 2060. At inception, BFA expects the 2060 Fund </font><font>to hold approximately 99%
of its assets in Underlying Funds that </font><font>seek to track particular underlying indexes of equity securities,
</font><font>approximately 1% of its assets in Underlying Funds that seek to </font><font>track particular fixed-income indexes and
the remainder of its </font><font>assets in Underlying Funds that invest primarily in money market
</font><font>instruments.</font></div> <div><font>At inception, the
Fund invests in the iShares 10+ Year Investment </font><font>Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets
</font><font>ETF, iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF, </font><font>iShares Russell 1000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000
ETF and </font><font>BlackRock Cash Funds. Factors such as fund classifications, </font><font>historical risk and performance, and
the relationship to other </font><font>Underlying Funds in the Fund are considered when selecting </font><font>Underlying Funds. The
specific Underlying Funds selected for the </font><font>Fund are determined at BFA’s discretion and may change as
</font><font>deemed appropriate to allow the Fund to meet its investment </font><font>objective. See the </font><font>“</font><font>Information About the Underlying
Funds</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>section of the prospectus for a list of the Underlying Funds, their </font><font>classification into equity,
fixed-income or money market funds </font><font>and a brief description of their investment objectives and primary
</font><font>investment strategies.</font></div> <div><font>Under
normal circumstances, the Fund’s asset allocation will </font><font>change over time according to a predetermined
</font><font>“</font><font>glide path</font><font>”</font><font> as </font><font>the Fund approaches its target date. The glide path below </font><font>represents the shifting of asset classes over time. As the glide </font><font>path shows, as time elapses prior to retirement, the
Fund’s asset </font><font>allocations become more conservative. This reflects the need for </font><font>reduced investment risk
as retirement approaches and the need </font><font>for lower volatility of the Fund, which for certain investors may be
</font><font>a primary source of income after retirement. During the year prior </font><font>to the Fund’s maturity date, its
allocation of assets is expected to </font><font>be similar to that of the Retirement Fund. Further, as retirement
</font><font>approaches, such Fund and the Retirement Fund is expected to, </font><font>subject to approval by the Trust’s
Board of Trustees (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Board</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>merge into a single fund.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The following chart illustrates the glide
path — the target </font><font>allocation among asset classes as the LifePath ETFs approach </font><font>their target
dates:</font></div> <div>

portfolio </font><font>managers, meets regularly to assess market conditions, review </font><font>the asset allocation targets of the
Fund, and determine whether </font><font>any changes are required to enable the Fund to achieve its </font><font>investment
objective.</font></div> <div><font>Although the asset allocation targets listed for the glide path are </font><font>general, long-term targets, BFA may periodically adjust the </font><font>proportion of equity and fixed-income Underlying Funds in
the </font><font>Fund, based on an assessment of the current market conditions, </font><font>the potential contribution of each asset
class to the expected risk </font><font>and return characteristics of the Fund, reallocations of the Fund’s
</font><font>composition to reflect intra-year movement along the glide path </font><font>and other factors. In general, such
adjustments will be limited; </font><font>however, BFA may determine that a greater degree of variation is </font><font>warranted to
protect the Fund or achieve its investment objective.</font></div> <div><font>BFA’s second step in the structuring of the
Fund is the selection of </font><font>the Underlying Funds. Factors such as fund classifications, </font><font>historical risk and
performance, and the relationship to other </font><font>Underlying Funds in the Fund are considered when selecting
</font><font>Underlying Funds. The specific Underlying Funds selected for the </font><font>Fund are determined at BFA’s

and primary </font><font>investment strategies.</font></div>
<div><font>Within the prescribed percentage allocations to equity and fixed-income</font><font> index funds, BFA seeks to diversify the Fund. The </font><font>allocation to Underlying Funds that track equity indexes may be
</font><font>further diversified by style (including both value and growth), </font><font>market capitalization (including emerging
growth, large-, mid-, and </font><font>small-capitalization), region </font><font>(i.e.</font><font>, U.S, and international, including </font><font>emerging markets) or other attributes. The allocation to </font><font>Underlying Funds that track fixed-income indexes may be further </font><font>diversified by sector (including government, corporate,
U.S. </font><font>agency MBS or debentures, CMBS, and other sectors), duration (a </font><font>of measurement of interest rate risk),
credit quality (including </font><font>investment grade bonds and high yield bonds), geographic </font><font>location (including U.S.
and non-U.S. securities, including bonds </font><font>of emerging market issuers), currency (U.S. dollar-denominated or
</font><font>local currency bonds) or other attributes. Though BFA seeks to </font><font>diversify the Fund, certain Underlying Funds
may concentrate </font><font>their investments in specific sectors or geographic regions or </font><font>countries. The percentage
allocation to the various styles of </font><font>equity and fixed-income Underlying Funds is determined at the
</font><font>discretion of the investment team and can be changed to reflect </font><font>the current market
environment.</font></div> <div><font>Certain Underlying Funds may invest in real estate investment </font><font>trusts (</font><font>“</font><font>REITs</font><font>”</font><font>), foreign securities, emerging market securities, </font><font>high yield bonds and derivative securities or instruments, such as </font><font>options and futures, the value of which is derived
from another </font><font>security, a currency or commodity, an interest rate or an index, </font><font>when seeking to match the
performance of a particular market </font><font>index. The Fund and certain Underlying Funds may also lend </font><font>securities
with a value up to one-third of their respective total </font><font>assets to financial institutions that provide cash or securities </font><font>issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government as collateral.</font></div> <div><font>Summary of Principal Risks</font></div>
<div><font>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your </font><font>investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail </font><font>that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain
risks, </font><font>including the principal risks noted below</font><font> </font><font>(either directly or </font><font>through its investments in the Underlying Funds), any of which </font><font>may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment </font><font>objective. Certain key risks are prioritized below
(with others </font><font>following in alphabetical order), but the relative significance of any </font><font>risk is difficult to
predict and may change over time. You should </font><font>review each risk factor carefully.</font></div> <div><font>Equity Securities Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes </font><font>in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other </font><font>asset classes. Certain Underlying Funds invest in common stocks, </font><font>which generally subject</font><font> </font><font>their holders to more risks than preferred </font><font>stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt
</font><font>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div><font>Allocation Risk.</font><font> The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment </font><font>objective depends upon BFA's ability to develop a model that </font><font>accurately assesses the Fund’s asset class allocation
and selects </font><font>an appropriate mix of Underlying Funds and other ETFs. There is a </font><font>risk that BFA's evaluations
and assumptions regarding asset </font><font>classes or Underlying Funds, which are utilized as inputs in the </font><font>model, may
be incorrect in view of actual market conditions.</font></div> <div><font>Investment in
Underlying Funds Risk.</font><font> The Fund invests </font><font>substantially all of its assets in</font><font> </font><font>the Underlying Funds, so the </font><font>Fund’s investment performance is directly related to the </font><font>performance of the Underlying Funds. The Fund’s NAV
will change </font><font>with changes in the value of the Underlying Funds and other </font><font>securities in which the Fund
invests based on their market </font><font>valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and </font><font>expenses
than a direct investment in the Underlying Funds.</font></div> <div><font>As the Underlying Funds, or the Fund’s
allocations among the </font><font>Underlying Funds, change from time to time, or to the extent that </font><font>the total annual
fund operating expenses of any Underlying Fund </font><font>change, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the
</font><font>Fund may increase or decrease.</font></div> <div><font>Affiliated Fund Risk.</font><font> In managing the Fund, BFA has the ability to </font><font>select Underlying Funds and substitute Underlying Funds with </font><font>other ETFs that it believes will achieve the Fund’s
objective. BFA </font><font>may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in selecting </font><font>Underlying Funds and
substituting Underlying Funds with other </font><font>ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by some Underlying Funds and
</font><font>other ETFs managed by BFA may be higher than the fees paid by </font><font>other Underlying Funds. If an Underlying Fund
or other ETF holds </font><font>interests in an affiliated fund in excess of a certain amount, the </font><font>Fund may be
prohibited from purchasing shares of that Underlying </font><font>Fund or other ETF.</font></div> <div><font>Retirement Income Risk. </font><font>The 2060 Fund does not provide a </font><font>guarantee that sufficient capital appreciation will be achieved to </font><font>provide adequate income at and through retirement.
The 2060 </font><font>Fund also does not ensure that you will have assets in your </font><font>account sufficient to cover your
retirement expenses; this will </font><font>depend on the amount of money you have invested in the 2060 </font><font>Fund, the length
of time you have held your investment, the </font><font>returns of the markets over time, the amount you spend in
</font><font>retirement, and your other assets and income sources.</font></div> <div><font>Selection Risk.</font><font> Selection risk is the risk that the securities </font><font>selected by the 2060 Fund management will underperform the </font><font>markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by
other </font><font>funds with similar investment objectives and investment </font><font>strategies. This means you may lose
money.</font></div> <div><font>Market Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The
Fund</font><font> </font><font>and the Underlying Funds could lose </font><font>money over short periods due to short-term market movements </font><font>and over longer periods during more prolonged market </font><font>downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </font><font>terrorism, public health issues, recessions, the

<div> <div><font>occurrence of a sovereign default or other
financial crisis, or other </font><font>events could have a significant impact on the Fund, the </font><font>Underlying Funds and
their investments and could result in </font><font>increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or Underlying </font><font>Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div><font>Asset Class Risk.</font><font> Securities and other assets in the Fund's or an </font><font>Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to </font><font>the general financial markets, a particular financial market or </font><font>other asset classes.</font></div>
<div><font>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.</font><font>  Only an Authorized </font><font>Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section </font><font>of this prospectus (the </font><font>“</font><font>Prospectus</font><font>”</font><font>)) may engage in creation or </font><font>redemption
transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those </font><font>Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or </font><font>redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of </font><font>institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on
an agency </font><font>basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent </font><font>that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to
</font><font>proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the </font><font>Fund and no other Authorized Participant is
able to step forward </font><font>to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a </font><font>premium or discount
to NAV and possibly face trading halts or </font><font>delisting.</font></div> <div><font>Concentration Risk.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to an </font><font>increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that </font><font>affect the Fund’s investments more than the
market as a whole, </font><font>to the extent that the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's investments </font><font>are concentrated in
the securities and/or other assets of a </font><font>particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, </font><font>market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or </font><font>asset class.</font></div>
<div><font>Currency Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Funds' </font><font>NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline </font><font>if a currency of a non-U.S. market in which a
Fund or an </font><font>Underlying Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if </font><font>there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. </font><font>Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change </font><font>quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may </font><font>change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div><font>Cybersecurity Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic </font><font>systems of the Fund or the Underlying Funds, the Funds' or the </font><font>Underlying Funds' adviser, distributor, the benchmark
provider </font><font>and other service providers, market makers, Authorized </font><font>Participants or the issuers of securities
in which the Fund invests </font><font>have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s
</font><font>business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to </font><font>the Fund and its shareholders. While
the Fund has established </font><font>business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking </font><font>to address system
breaches or failures, there are inherent </font><font>limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund
</font><font>cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s </font><font>benchmark provider and other service
providers, market makers, </font><font>Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund
</font><font>invests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Derivatives Risk. </font><font>The Fund  or an Underlying Fund may invest in </font><font>certain types of derivatives contracts, including futures, options </font><font>and swaps, which can be more sensitive to changes in
interest </font><font>rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices than conventional </font><font>securities, which can result in
greater losses to the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Energy Sector Risk.</font><font> The market value of securities in the energy </font><font>sector may decline for many reasons, including, among others, </font><font>changes in energy prices, energy supply and demand, government </font><font>regulations, costs related to exploration and production
and </font><font>energy conservation efforts. Companies in the energy sector may </font><font>also be significantly impacted by
natural disasters, social and </font><font>political unrest, war and environmental damage and may also be </font><font>at risk for
increased litigation and negative publicity or public </font><font>perception. The energy sector may experience significant market </font><font>volatility (</font><font>e.g</font><font>., as a result
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in </font><font>February 2022 and the resulting sanctions on Russia and other
</font><font>responses by the U.S. and other actors).</font></div> <div><font>Financials Sector Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The performance of companies in the </font><font>financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, </font><font>including, among others, changes in government regulations, </font><font>economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating
</font><font>downgrades, adverse public perception, exposure concentration </font><font>and decreased liquidity in credit markets.
The impact of changes </font><font>in regulation of any individual financial company, or of the </font><font>financials sector as a
whole, cannot be predicted. Cybersecurity </font><font>incidents and technology malfunctions and failures have become
</font><font>increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </font><font>companies in this sector, which may negatively
impact</font><font> </font><font>an
</font><font>Underlying Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Geographic Risk</font><font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic </font><font>region in which the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests, which
</font><font>could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of </font><font>companies in the specific geographic
region, causing an adverse </font><font>impact on the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's investments in, or </font><font>which are
exposed to, the affected region.</font></div> <div><font>Healthcare Sector Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The profitability of companies in the </font><font>healthcare sector may be affected by government regulations and </font><font>government healthcare programs, increases or decreases
in the </font><font>cost of medical products and services, an increased emphasis on </font><font>outpatient services, demand for
medical products and services </font><font>and product liability claims, among other factors. Many healthcare </font><font>companies
are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the </font><font>expiration of a company’s patent may adversely affect that </font><font>company’s profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to </font><font>competitive forces that may result in price
discounting, and may </font><font>be thinly capitalized and susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div> <div><font>Indexing Investment Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Underlying Funds are not actively </font><font>managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive </font><font>positions in the Underlying Funds under any market conditions, </font><font>including declining markets.</font></div>
<div><font>Industrials Sector Risk.</font><font> Companies in the industrials sector may </font><font>be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for </font><font>products and services, product obsolescence, claims for </font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div>
<div><font>S-4</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>environmental damage or product liability and
changes in general </font><font>economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div> <div><font>Infectious Illness Risk. </font><font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious </font><font>illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel </font><font>restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged
</font><font>quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, business </font><font>closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs,
ratings downgrades, </font><font>defaults and other significant economic, social and political </font><font>impacts. Markets may
experience temporary closures, extreme </font><font>volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading
</font><font>costs. Such events may adversely affect the Fund and its </font><font>investments and may impact the Fund’s
ability to purchase or sell </font><font>securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased </font><font>premiums or discounts
to the Fund's NAV. Despite the </font><font>development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic </font><font>and its
effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</font></div> <div><font>Information Technology
Sector Risk.</font><font> Information technology </font><font>companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product
</font><font>obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual </font><font>property rights and may be adversely affected
by the loss or </font><font>impairment of those rights. Companies in the information </font><font>technology sector are facing
increased government and </font><font>regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </font><font>regulatory action.
Companies in the software industry may be </font><font>adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or
</font><font>fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and </font><font>services and actual or perceived
vulnerabilities in their products </font><font>or services.</font></div> <div><font>Infrastructure Industry Risk. </font><font>Companies in the infrastructure </font><font>industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could </font><font>adversely affect their business or operations, including high
</font><font>interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, </font><font>high degrees of leverage, costs associated
with governmental, </font><font>environmental and other regulations, the level of government </font><font>spending on infrastructure
projects, and other factors.</font></div> <div><font>Issuer Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the </font><font>performance of individual securities to which the Fund or an </font><font>Underlying Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial
condition </font><font>or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the </font><font>value of the securities to
decline.</font></div> <div><font>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</font><font> Large-capitalization </font><font>companies may be less able than smaller capitalization </font><font>companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization</font><font> companies may be more mature and subject to
</font><font>more limited growth potential compared with smaller </font><font>capitalization companies. During different market
cycles, the </font><font>performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </font><font>overall performance of the
broader securities markets.</font></div> <div><font>Management Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds are </font><font>subject to management risk, which is the risk that the investment </font><font>process, techniques and risk analyses applied by BFA
will not </font><font>produce the desired results, and that securities selected by BFA </font><font>may underperform the market or
any relevant benchmark. In </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>addition, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect </font><font>the investment techniques available to BFA in
connection with </font><font>managing the Fund and the Underlying Funds and may also </font><font>adversely affect the ability of the
Fund and the Underlying Funds </font><font>to achieve their investment objective.</font></div> <div><font>Market Trading Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds face </font><font>numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an </font><font>active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary </font><font>markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the </font><font>creation/redemption process. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, </font><font>AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES </font><font>TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO
NAV</font><font>.</font></div> <div><font>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization</font><font> companies, mid-capitalization companies may be </font><font>less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In </font><font>addition, the securities of mid-capitalization companies
may be </font><font>more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization </font><font>companies.</font></div>
<div><font>National Closed Market Trading Risk.</font><font> To the extent that the </font><font>underlying securities or other instruments held by the Fund or the </font><font>Underlying Funds trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign </font><font>markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on
</font><font>which the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, </font><font>there are likely to be deviations
between the current price of such </font><font>an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying
</font><font>security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>.,
the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's quote from the </font><font>closed foreign
market).</font><font> </font><font>The impact of a closed foreign market on </font><font>the Fund or an Underlying Fund is likely to be greater where a </font><font>large portion of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's
underlying </font><font>securities or other instruments trade on that closed foreign </font><font>market or when the foreign market
is closed for unscheduled </font><font>reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts </font><font>to the
Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater </font><font>than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div><font>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. </font><font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers </font><font>carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These </font><font>risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial </font><font>reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or
</font><font>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange </font><font>control regulations, political
instability, regulatory and economic </font><font>differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international
</font><font>capital. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic </font><font>Risk, European Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>North American </font><font>Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div> <div><font>Non-U.S.
Securities Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S.</font><font> issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in </font><font>those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or </font><font>nationalization. The Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund</font> <font> </font><font>may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events </font><font>affecting issuers of non-U.S.
securities</font><font> </font><font>or non-U.S. markets. In </font><font>addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of </font><font>securities and may be unable to respond effectively to
changes in </font><font>trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings </font><font>difficult or impossible at
times. The Fund is specifically exposed </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>S-5</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>North </font><font>American Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div><font>Operational Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The
Fund</font><font> </font><font>and the Underlying Funds are </font><font>exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, </font><font>including, but not limited to, human error, processing
and </font><font>communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, </font><font>counterparties or other third
parties, failed or inadequate </font><font>processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the </font><font>Underlying Funds
and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks </font><font>through controls and procedures. However, these measures do
</font><font>not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </font><font>significant operational
risks.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in China</font><font>. </font><font>Investments in Chinese securities, </font><font>including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, </font><font>subject the Fund or the Underlying Funds to risks
specific to </font><font>China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of </font><font>economic, political and social
instability. China is an emerging </font><font>market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time </font><font>to time
in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few </font><font>decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of </font><font>economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of </font><font>private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese
markets </font><font>generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing </font><font>anomalies resulting from
governmental influence, a lack of </font><font>publicly available information and/or political and social
</font><font>instability.</font></div> <div><font>Chinese companies
are also subject to the risk that Chinese </font><font>authorities can intervene in their operations and structure.
</font><font>Internal social unrest or confrontations with neighboring </font><font>countries, including military conflicts in
response to such events, </font><font>may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a </font><font>greater risk of
currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, </font><font>interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation.</font></div>
<div><font>China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and </font><font>strained international relations. Additionally, China is alleged to </font><font>have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks
against foreign </font><font>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened </font><font>responses to such activity and
strained international relations, </font><font>including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or </font><font>cyberattacks on
the Chinese government or Chinese companies, </font><font>may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in </font><font>which the Fund invests. Incidents involving China's or the region's </font><font>security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets
and may </font><font>adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's </font><font>investments. Export growth continues to be a
major driver of </font><font>China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese </font><font>products and services,
institution of additional tariffs or other </font><font>trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions </font><font>or a trade war between China and the U.S. or in response to </font><font>actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in
any of </font><font>the economies of China's key trading partners may have an </font><font>adverse impact on the Chinese
economy.</font></div> <div><font>Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that are listed </font><font>on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of </font><font>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>oversight as companies
in more developed countries. As a result, </font><font>information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund
</font><font>invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with </font><font>securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be
delisted if they do not </font><font>meet U.S. accounting standards and auditor oversight </font><font>requirements, which would
significantly decrease the liquidity and </font><font>value of the securities. There may be significant obstacles to
</font><font>obtaining information necessary for investigations into or </font><font>litigation against Chinese companies, and
shareholders may have </font><font>limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does </font><font>not select
investments based on investor protection </font><font>considerations.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries</font><font>. </font><font>The Fund’s and the </font><font>Underlying Fund's investment in developed country issuers may </font><font>subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, </font><font>economic and other risks associated with
developed countries. </font><font>Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the </font><font>global economy and
have generally experienced slower economic </font><font>growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed
</font><font>countries have experienced security concerns, such as war, </font><font>terrorism and strained international relations.
Incidents involving </font><font>a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its </font><font>markets and
may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s or </font><font>an Underlying Fund's investments. In addition, developed </font><font>countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic </font><font>conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory
burdens, </font><font>debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in India</font><font>.</font><font> Investments in Indian issuers involve </font><font>risks that are specific to India, including legal, regulatory, political, </font><font>currency and economic risks. Political and legal uncertainty, </font><font>greater government control over the economy, currency
</font><font>fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or </font><font>expropriation of assets may result in higher
potential for losses. </font><font>The securities markets in India are relatively underdeveloped and </font><font>may subject the
Fund or an Underlying Fund to higher transaction </font><font>costs or greater uncertainty than investments in more developed </font><font>securities markets.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Japan</font><font>.</font><font> The Japanese economy may be </font><font>subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social </font><font>instability, which could have a negative impact on Japanese </font><font>securities. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate
has </font><font>generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and </font><font>it may remain low in the future. In
addition, Japan is subject to the </font><font>risk of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
</font><font>typhoons and tsunamis, which could negatively affect the Fund</font><font> </font><font>or </font><font>an Underlying Fund. Japan’s relations with its neighbors have at </font><font>times been strained, and strained relations may cause uncertainty </font><font>in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the
overall Japanese </font><font>economy.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Russia. </font><font>Investing in Russian securities </font><font>involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory, currency and </font><font>economic risks that are specific to Russia. In
addition, investing in </font><font>Russian securities involves risks associated with the settlement of </font><font>portfolio
transactions and loss of the Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying </font><font>Fund's ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the </font><font>system of share registration and custody in
Russia. Governments </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>S-6</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>in the U.S. and many other countries have
imposed economic </font><font>sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate </font><font>and banking entities. A
number of jurisdictions may also institute </font><font>broader sanctions on Russia. Russia has issued a number of
</font><font>countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits </font><font>by limited liability companies
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, dividends), and prohibit </font><font>Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated </font><font>persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly states</font><font>”</font><font> as well as the export of raw </font><font>materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned </font><font>persons. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </font><font>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military
action, </font><font>resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, </font><font>including declines in its stock
markets and the value of the ruble </font><font>against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be
</font><font>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other </font><font>actions (including cyberattacks and
espionage) or resulting actual </font><font>and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing </font><font>and
financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or </font><font>purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, </font><font>tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian </font><font>companies, or Russian individuals, including politicians, may
</font><font>impact Russia’s economy and Russian companies in which the </font><font>Fund </font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund invests. Actual and threatened </font><font>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets </font><font>for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and
natural gas, as </font><font>well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on
such sectors globally. Russian </font><font>companies may be unable to pay dividends and, if they pay </font><font>dividends, the
Fund </font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund may be unable to </font><font>receive them. As a result of sanctions, the Fund is currently </font><font>restricted from trading in Russian securities, including
those in its </font><font>portfolio, while the Underlying Indexes of the Underlying Funds </font><font>have removed Russian
securities. It is unknown when, or if, </font><font>sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian </font><font>securities will resume.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia</font><font>.</font><font> The ability of foreign investors </font><font>(such as the Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund) to invest in the </font><font>securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability </font><font>could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government
at any time, </font><font>and unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign </font><font>ownership in such securities.
The economy of Saudi Arabia is </font><font>dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained decrease in </font><font>petroleum prices
could have a negative impact on all aspects of </font><font>the economy. Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian
</font><font>issuers involve risks not typically associated with investments in </font><font>securities of issuers in more developed
countries that may </font><font>negatively affect the value of the Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or Underlying Fund's </font><font>investments. Such heightened risks may include, among others, </font><font>expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and </font><font>government intervention in international trade,
confiscatory </font><font>taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or </font><font>military involvement in
governmental decision making, armed </font><font>conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </font><font>and/or
socioeconomic unrest. There remains the possibility that </font><font>instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </font><font>the economy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no assurance of </font><font>political stability in Saudi Arabia.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Saudi
Arabia Broker Risk.</font><font>  There are a number of different ways </font><font>of conducting transactions in equity
securities in the Saudi </font><font>Arabian market.  The Fund (or an Underlying Fund) generally </font><font>expects to
conduct its transactions in a manner in which the Fund </font><font>would not be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single </font><font>broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who </font><font>can provide services to the Fund (or an Underlying Fund),
which </font><font>may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity or timing of </font><font>Fund (or an Underlying Fund)
transactions.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Taiwan</font><font>.</font><font> Investments in Taiwanese issuers
</font><font>involve risks that are specific to Taiwan, including legal, </font><font>regulatory, political, currency and economic
risks. Political and </font><font>economic developments of Taiwan’s neighbors may have an </font><font>adverse effect on
Taiwan’s economy. Specifically, Taiwan’s </font><font>geographic proximity and history of political contention with </font><font>China have resulted in ongoing tensions, which may materially </font><font>affect the Taiwanese economy and its securities
market.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the U.S</font><font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S.
</font><font>economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its </font><font>financial markets decline, may have an adverse
effect on the </font><font>securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Funds has </font><font>exposure.</font></div>
<div><font>Securities Lending Risk. </font><font>The Fund  or an Underlying Fund may </font><font>engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk </font><font>that the Fund or the Underlying Funds may lose money because </font><font>the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the
securities </font><font>in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Funds </font><font>could also lose money in the
event of a decline in the value of </font><font>collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value </font><font>of
any investments made with cash collateral. These events could </font><font>also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an </font><font>Underlying
Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and
</font><font>large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies </font><font>may be less stable and more susceptible to
adverse </font><font>developments. In addition, the securities of small-capitalization </font><font>companies may be more volatile
and less liquid than those of mid- </font><font>and large-capitalization companies.</font></div> <div><font>Tax Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Because the Fund is expected to invest in the </font><font>Underlying Funds, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of
</font><font>an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred </font><font>as </font><font>“</font><font>wash sales.</font><font>”</font><font> Distributions of short-term capital gains by an </font><font>Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the </font><font>Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss </font><font>carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of an
Underlying </font><font>Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Technology Sector Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including </font><font>information technology companies,</font><font> </font><font>may have limited product
</font><font>lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology </font><font>companies typically face intense competition
and potentially rapid </font><font>product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on </font><font>intellectual property rights
and may be adversely affected by the </font><font>loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the technology </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>sector may face increased government and
regulatory scrutiny </font><font>and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action.</font></div> <div><font>Utilities Sector Risk.</font><font> The utilities sector is subject to significant </font><font>government regulation and oversight. Deregulation, however, may </font><font>subject utility companies to greater competition and may
reduce </font><font>their profitability. Companies in the utilities sector may be </font><font>adversely affected due to increases in
fuel and operating costs, </font><font>rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of </font><font>complying with
U.S. federal and state regulations, among other </font><font>factors.</font></div> <div><font>Valuation Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The price the Fund  or an Underlying Fund could </font><font>receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from
</font><font>the
Fund's</font><font> </font><font>or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security or </font><font>other asset, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in </font><font>low volume or volatile markets, or assets that
are impacted by </font><font>market disruption events or that are valued using a fair value </font><font>methodology as a result of
trade suspensions or for other </font><font>reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's
portfolio may change on days </font><font>or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to </font><font>purchase or sell
the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's shares. </font><font>Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem shares of the
</font><font>Fund or an Underlying Fund on days when the Fund or </font><font>an Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued
securities or other </font><font>instruments may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher </font><font>redemption
proceeds, than they would have received had the </font><font>securities or other instruments not been fair valued or been </font><font>valued using a different methodology. The ability to value </font><font>investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors
by </font><font>pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> <div><font>Performance Information</font></div> <div><font>As
of the date of the Prospectus, the Fund has not commenced </font><font>operations and therefore has no performance information to </font><font>report.</font></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Management</font></div>
<div><font>Investment Adviser.</font><font>
BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div> <div><font>Portfolio Managers.</font><font> Christopher Chung and Suzanne Ly  (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Portfolio
Managers</font><font>”</font><font>) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day </font><font>management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a </font><font>portfolio management team. Mr. Chung and Ms. Ly have been
</font><font>Portfolio Managers of the Fund since inception (2023).</font></div> <div><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font></div> <div><font>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be </font><font>bought and sold in the secondary market through a
broker-dealer. </font><font>Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, </font><font>shares may trade at a price
greater than NAV (a premium) or less </font><font>than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to </font><font>the
difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay </font><font>to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller </font><font>is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or </font><font>selling shares in the secondary market (the </font><font>“</font><font>bid-ask spread</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tax Information</font></div> <div><font>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to you </font><font>as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are
investing </font><font>through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an </font><font>individual retirement account
(</font><font>“</font><font>IRA</font><font>”</font><font>), in which case, your </font><font>distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</font></div>
<div><font>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial </font><font>Intermediaries</font></div> <div><font>If you
purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or </font><font>other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related </font><font>companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and </font><font>presentations, educational training programs,
conferences, the </font><font>development of technology platforms and reporting systems or </font><font>other services related to the
sale or promotion of the Fund. These </font><font>payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the
</font><font>broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to </font><font>recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask
your </font><font>salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more </font><font>information.</font></div>
