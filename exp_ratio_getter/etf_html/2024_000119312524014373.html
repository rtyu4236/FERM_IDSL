<div> </div> </div> <div><font>Each Fund invests in a combination of equity and fixed-income
index funds and money market funds (the </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying </font><font>Funds</font><font>”</font><font>). BlackRock Fund Advisors (</font><font>“</font><font>BFA</font><font>”</font><font>) serves as investment adviser to the Funds, and BFA or its affiliates serves as </font><font>investment adviser to the Underlying
Funds.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>) only in aggregations of a specified number of </font><font>shares (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Unit</font><font>”</font><font>), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions </font><font>(including any portion of such
securities for which cash may be substituted) (the </font><font>“</font><font>Deposit Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Component</font><font>”</font><font>). Shares of the Funds are listed
for trading on </font><font>NYSE Arca, Inc. (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Listing Exchange</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>NYSE Arca</font><font>”</font><font>), a national securities exchange. Shares of each Fund are traded in </font><font>the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable
</font><font>only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the </font><font>Creation and Redemption
of Creation Units-Role of the </font><font>Authorized Participant</font><font> section of this SAI) and, generally, in
exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined </font><font>in the </font><font>Redemption of Creation
Units</font><font> section of this SAI). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally </font><font>50,000 or
multiples thereof.</font></div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares
are effected fully or partially in cash </font><font>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in </font><font>advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized
</font><font>Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Portfolio Holding Information</font><font> section of this SAI) maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth </font><font>in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust
may use such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. </font><font>See the </font><font>Creation and
Redemption of Creation Units</font><font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with </font><font>creations or
redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with </font><font>in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with
respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be </font><font>limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment
companies </font><font>offering redeemable securities.</font></div>
<div><font>Exchange Listing and Trading</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained
in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below

<div> <div><font>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and
trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary </font><font>markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance
that the </font><font>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The </font><font>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </font><font>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of each Fund's shares, there are fewer than 50 record
</font><font>and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </font><font>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall
</font><font>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </font><font>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>As in the case of other
publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </font><font>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other
charges.</font></div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain
convenient trading ranges for </font><font>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </font><font>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Investment Strategies and Risks of the Funds</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund is one of a group of funds referred to as the </font><font>“</font><font>LifePath ETFs,</font><font>”</font><font> each of which seeks to provide
for retirement </font><font>outcomes based on quantitatively measured risk that investors on average may be willing to accept given a particular time </font><font>horizon.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Funds are actively managed and allocate and reallocate their assets among a combination of Underlying Funds in
</font><font>proportions based on their own comprehensive investment strategies.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Set forth below is more detailed information regarding types of instruments in which the Underlying Funds, and in some
</font><font>cases, the Funds, may invest, strategies BFA may employ in pursuit of</font><font> </font><font>a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's investment objective, </font><font>and related risks.</font></div>
<div><font>Asset-Backed and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities.</font><font>  </font><font> Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest in asset-backed </font><font>securities (</font><font>“</font><font>ABS</font><font>”</font><font>) and commercial mortgage-backed securities
(</font><font>“</font><font>CMBS</font><font>”</font><font>). ABS are securities backed by installment contracts, </font><font>credit-card receivables or other assets. CMBS are securities backed
by commercial real estate properties. Both ABS and CMBS </font><font>represent interests in </font><font>“</font><font>pools</font><font>”</font><font> of assets in which payments of both
interest and principal on the securities are made on a </font><font>regular basis. The payments are, in effect,
</font><font>“</font><font>passed through</font><font>”</font><font> to the holder of the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer </font><font>or guarantor of the securities). The average life of
ABS and CMBS varies with the maturities of the underlying instruments </font><font>and, as a result of prepayments, can often be less than the original maturity of the assets underlying the
securities. For this </font><font>and other reasons, the stated maturity of an ABS or CMBS may be shortened, and the security’s total return may be difficult </font><font>to predict precisely. Also see </font><font>Mortgage Pass-Through Securities</font><font> and </font><font>Mortgage Securities</font><font>
below.</font></div> <div><font>Beginning in the second half of 2007 through 2009, the market for ABS and mortgage-backed securities
(</font><font>“</font><font>MBS</font><font>”</font><font>) </font><font>experienced substantially, often dramatically, lower valuations and reduced liquidity. These instruments continue to be
</font><font>subject to liquidity constraints, price volatility, credit downgrades and increases in default rates and, therefore, may be more </font><font>difficult to value and more difficult to dispose of than previously.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Bonds.</font><font>
 </font><font>Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest in bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S.</font><font> company or governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on
</font><font>specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are </font><font>used by issuers to borrow money from investors.</font></div> <div><font>An
issuer may have the right to redeem or </font><font>“</font><font>call</font><font>”</font><font> a bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the </font><font>proceeds at lower market
rates.</font><font> </font><font>Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when
bonds </font><font>mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a </font><font>“</font><font>coupon</font><font>”</font><font> rate that is fixed for the life of the
</font><font>bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. </font><font>Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its </font><font>value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when
an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its </font><font>face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a
discount pay less </font><font>current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such </font><font>fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of
</font><font>bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on </font><font>“</font><font>floating rate</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>variable rate</font><font>”</font><font> bonds </font><font>may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final
maturities. </font><font>Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of </font><font>“</font><font>floating rate</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>variable rate</font><font>”</font><font> bonds fluctuates much less in </font><font>response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their
value may decline if their interest </font><font>rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. An Underlying Fund may treat some of these bonds as </font><font>having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally,
</font><font>prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues </font><font>and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or
</font><font>subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets and, in the event </font><font>of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general
</font><font>creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Borrowing.
</font><font> </font><font>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments
due from </font><font>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The
incurrence of </font><font>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </font><font>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </font><font>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </font><font>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as
</font><font>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </font><font>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in
</font><font>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </font><font>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s
</font><font>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </font><font>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it
</font><font>may be disadvantageous to do so.</font></div> <div><font>Corporate Bonds.</font><font>
 </font><font>Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest in investment grade and/or high yield corporate bonds. The
</font><font>investment return of corporate bonds reflects interest earned on the security and changes in the market value of the security. </font><font>The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market rate of interest, the credit rating of the
</font><font>issuer, the issuer’s performance and perceptions of the issuer in the marketplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the </font><font>securities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by an instrument.</font></div>
<div><font>Currency
Transactions.</font><font>  </font><font>A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (</font><font>“</font><font>OTC</font><font>”</font><font>) obligation to purchase or sell a specific </font><font>currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than
two days from the date on which the contract </font><font>is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC </font><font>currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon
</font><font>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures </font><font>exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a </font><font>specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and
</font><font>delivery of the underlying currency. The Underlying Funds that may engage in currency transactions do not expect to engage </font><font>in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of the</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Funds' assets that are </font><font>denominated in a non-U.S. currency. An</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund may enter into non-U.S. currency forward and non-U.S. currency </font><font>futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its
</font><font>distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange
transactions are </font><font>effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </font><font>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_593a1b40-71cd-48cf-899d-302335fe99f2_4"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>include, but are not limited to, exchange rate
risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference </font><font>by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or
particular transactions in non-U.S.</font><font> currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or </font><font>correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the Underlying
</font><font>Fund's performance and may lower the</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund’s return. Each</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund could experience losses if the value </font><font>of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly
correlated with its other investments or if it could not close </font><font>out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, each Underlying Fund could incur
transaction costs, </font><font>including trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Diversification
Status.</font><font>  </font><font>The Funds are diversified. A fund classified as </font><font>“</font><font>diversified</font><font>”</font><font> under the 1940 Act may not purchase </font><font>securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
government, its agencies or </font><font>instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than </font><font>5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the </font><font>outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more
</font><font>than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified</font><font> without shareholder approval.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund intends to
maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a </font><font>RIC for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, and to relieve the Fund of
any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent </font><font>that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement.
</font><font>Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the </font><font>Fund and may make it less likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective.</font></div> <div><font>Equity Securities. </font><font> </font><font>Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed-income securities. The market price of </font><font>equity
securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities may decline in value due to </font><font>factors affecting equity securities markets generally; particular
industries, sectors or geographic regions represented in those </font><font>markets; or individual issuers. The types of developments that may affect an issuer of an equity security include
management </font><font>performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services. Common and preferred stock </font><font>represent equity or ownership interests in an issuer. Preferred stock, however, pays dividends at a specified rate and has
</font><font>precedence over common stock in the payment of dividends. In the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy, the </font><font>claims of owners of bonds and preferred stock take precedence over the claims of those who own common stock.</font></div> <div><font>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</font><font>  </font><font>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </font><font>used by a Fund and certain of the Underlying Funds to
access its investable universe, simulate investments that would </font><font>otherwise be eligible, facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may enter
into </font><font>futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund or an Underlying </font><font>Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund and each Underlying
</font><font>Fund intend to use futures and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading
</font><font>Commission (the </font><font>“</font><font>CFTC</font><font>”</font><font>) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act
(</font><font>“</font><font>CEA</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA, with respect to certain Underlying </font><font>Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so </font><font>that BFA, with respect to such Funds or an Underlying Fund, is not subject to registration

Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div> <div><font>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific
</font><font>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </font><font>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may </font><font>enter
into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and </font><font>believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon
entering into a futures contract, a Fund or an Underlying </font><font>Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </font><font>“</font><font>initial margin,</font><font>”</font><font> which is </font><font>similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund or an Underlying
Fund upon </font><font>termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </font><font>“</font><font>variation margin,</font><font>”</font><font> will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the futures </font><font>contract
fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as </font><font>“</font><font>marking-to-market.</font><font>”</font><font> At any time prior to the
expiration of a futures contract, each Fund or an Underlying Fund may elect to </font><font>close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s
or an Underlying Fund's existing </font><font>position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the </font></div>

<div> <div><font>purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return
for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying futures contract </font><font>at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of
an option, the delivery of </font><font>the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of the </font><font>accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the
</font><font>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </font><font>futures contract.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </font><font>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the
</font><font>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </font><font>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund or an Underlying Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call
</font><font>options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also </font><font>known as the </font><font>“</font><font>strike price,</font><font>”</font><font> less the premium received from writing the put. The Funds or an Underlying Fund may purchase </font><font>and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of
</font><font>their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect </font><font>to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</font></div>
<div><font>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to or dispose of securities that are otherwise eligible
investments </font><font>at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that being sought by the Fund or </font><font>otherwise to achieve the Fund's objective.</font><font> </font><font>A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified </font><font>price (</font><font>“</font><font>exercise price</font><font>”</font><font>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder the right to sell a specific security at an </font><font>exercise price
within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the </font><font>“</font><font>writer</font><font>”</font><font> a premium, which is </font><font>paid at the time of
purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such option is exercised. Each Fund or an </font><font>Underlying Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of
a decline in the market value of securities </font><font>held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed to purchase. Each </font><font>Fund or an Underlying Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to
</font><font>hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund or an </font><font>Underlying Fund may purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market
</font><font>through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the </font><font>appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or
</font><font>physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable </font><font>only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>Knock-in </font><font>Events</font><font>”</font><font>) or conditions that trigger termination (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>Knock-out Events</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Investments in Underlying Funds. </font><font> </font><font>Each Underlying Fund is a type of investment company referred to as an exchange-traded </font><font>fund (</font><font>“</font><font>ETF</font><font>”</font><font>). Each Underlying Fund is designed to track a particular index and is advised by BFA. Shares of the Underlying
</font><font>Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges and trade throughout the day on those exchanges and other </font><font>secondary markets. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the national securities exchanges necessary to
</font><font>maintain the listing of shares of the Underlying Funds will continue to be met. A national securities exchange may, but is not </font><font>required to, remove the shares of the Underlying Funds from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month
</font><font>period beginning upon the commencement of trading of an Underlying Fund, there are fewer than 50 record and/or
</font><font>beneficial holders of the shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of an Underlying Fund's underlying </font><font>index is no longer calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition exist that, in the opinion of the </font><font>national securities exchange, makes further dealings on the national securities exchange inadvisable. A national securities
</font><font>exchange will remove the shares of an Underlying Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Underlying Fund. </font><font>Shares of each Underlying Fund trade on exchanges at prices at, above or below their most recent NAV. The per share NAV of
</font><font>each Underlying Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of such </font><font>Underlying Fund's holdings since the most recent calculation. The trading prices of an Underlying Fund's shares fluctuate
</font><font>continuously throughout trading hours based on market supply and demand rather than NAV. The trading prices of an
</font><font>Underlying Fund's shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. Any of these factors may </font><font>lead to an Underlying Fund's shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Exchange prices are not expected to correlate
</font><font>exactly with an Underlying Fund's NAV due to timing reasons as well as market supply and demand factors. In addition, </font><font>disruptions to an Underlying Fund's creations and redemptions or the existence of extreme market volatility may result in
</font><font>trading prices of Underlying Fund shares that differ significantly from NAV. If the Funds purchase shares of the Underlying </font><font>Funds at a time when the market price of an Underlying Fund's shares are at a premium to the NAV or sells at a time when </font><font>the
market price of an Underlying Fund is at a discount to the NAV, then the Funds may sustain losses.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>As in the case of other publicly-traded
securities, brokers' commissions on buying or selling shares of the Underlying Funds </font><font>will be based on negotiated commission rates at customary levels. An investment in an ETF
generally presents the same </font><font>primary risks as an investment in an open-end investment company that is not exchange-traded and that has the same </font><font>investment objectives, strategies, and policies. However, ETFs are subject to the following risks that do not apply to an open-end</font><font> investment company that is not exchange-traded: (i) the market price of the ETF's shares may trade at a discount to their
</font><font>net asset value; (ii) an active trading market for an ETF's shares may not develop or be maintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's </font><font>shares may be halted if the listing exchange's officials deem such action appropriate, the shares are delisted from the
</font><font>exchange, or the activation of market-wide </font><font>“</font><font>circuit breakers</font><font>”</font><font> (which are tied to large swings
in stock prices) halts stock </font><font>trading generally.</font></div> <div><font>Lending Portfolio Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </font><font>creditworthy, including borrowers
affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </font><font>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall
be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </font><font>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund’s total </font><font>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the
</font><font>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </font><font>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>With respect to loans that are
collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </font><font>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the
amount earned on the reinvestment of </font><font>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </font><font>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund
</font><font>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </font><font>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </font><font>are
subject to investment risk.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio
</font><font>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </font><font>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>BTC</font><font>”</font><font>) acts as securities </font><font>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance
</font><font>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </font><font>“</font><font>Board,</font><font>”</font><font> the trustees of which are the </font><font>“</font><font>Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>). JPMorgan </font><font>Chase Bank, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>JPMorgan</font><font>”</font><font>) serves as custodian for the Funds in
connection with certain securities lending activities.</font></div> <div><font>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </font><font>in the settlement and accounting process), </font><font>“</font><font>gap</font><font>”</font><font> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </font><font>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to
pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </font><font>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the
assets being loaned due to </font><font>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </font><font>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending
</font><font>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </font><font>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a
</font><font>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </font><font>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the
</font><font>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </font><font>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its
</font><font>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </font><font>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will
</font><font>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </font><font>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </font><font>be
changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </font><font>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could,
for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </font><font>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</font></div>
<div><font>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their
</font><font>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </font><font>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in
the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </font><font>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as
potential additional government </font><font>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </font><font>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</font></div> <div><font>Liquidity Risk Management.</font><font>  </font><font>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Rule</font><font>”</font><font>) requires open-end funds, </font><font>including ETFs such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Program</font><font>”</font><font>) and enhance </font><font>disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a
Liquidity Program, and </font><font>the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as the administrator of the </font><font>Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk </font><font>and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a
</font><font>“</font><font>highly liquid
investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>moderately liquid
investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>less liquid </font><font>investment</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>illiquid investment.</font><font>”</font><font> The Liquidity Rule defines
</font><font>“</font><font>liquidity risk</font><font>”</font><font> as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests </font><font>to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the
remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a </font><font>Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific
considerations under </font><font>the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for </font><font>“</font><font>in-kind</font><font>”</font><font> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a </font><font>less
liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div>
<div><font>Non-Diversification Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Underlying Funds may be classified as </font><font>“</font><font>non-diversified.</font><font>”</font><font> This means that the </font><font>Underlying Funds may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a
small number of issuers. </font><font>As a result, the Underlying Funds may be more susceptible to the risks associated with these particular issuers or to a single </font><font>economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting these issuers.</font></div> <div><font>Non-U.S. Securities and Emerging Markets Securities. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest in the securities of non-U.S.</font><font> issuers, which involves special risks and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These </font><font>include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of
expropriation or potentially </font><font>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability which could affect </font><font>U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, potential restrictions of the flow of international capital, generally less liquid and less </font><font>efficient securities markets, generally greater price volatility, less publicly available information about issuers, higher
</font><font>transaction and custody costs, delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures, difficulties in enforcing contractual </font><font>obligations, less developed judicial systems to settle disputes, lesser liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of </font><font>most non-U.S. securities markets, substantial government interference with the economy and transaction costs of foreign
</font><font>currency conversions. The Underlying Funds may have difficulty valuing such securities due to these or other considerations. </font><font>Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual foreign economies
</font><font>may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy with respect to growth of gross domestic product
(</font><font>“</font><font>GDP</font><font>”</font><font>), rate of </font><font>inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions. In addition, changes
in foreign </font><font>exchange rates also will affect the value of securities denominated or quoted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Certain </font><font>foreign markets have specific geographical risks such as a heightened likelihood of earthquakes, tsunamis, or volcanoes.
</font><font>Certain foreign markets also experience acts of terrorism, territorial disputes or other defense concerns. These situations may </font><font>have a significant impact on the economies of, and investments in, these geographic areas.</font></div> <div><font>To the extent an Underlying Fund invests in publicly traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain investments in such
</font><font>stocks may be in the form of American Depositary Receipts (</font><font>“</font><font>ADRs</font><font>”</font><font>), Global Depositary Receipts (</font><font>“</font><font>GDRs</font><font>”</font><font>) and European </font><font>Depositary Receipts (</font><font>“</font><font>EDRs</font><font>”</font><font>) (collectively, </font><font>“</font><font>depositary receipts</font><font>”</font><font>). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank </font><font>or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying
securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not </font><font>necessarily be denominated in the same currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a
U.S. bank or </font><font>trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes </font><font>referred to as Continental depositary receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies,
</font><font>that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like </font><font>global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for </font><font>use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are
</font><font>tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the world. The Funds or an Underlying Fund may </font><font>invest in depositary receipts through
</font><font>“</font><font>sponsored</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>unsponsored</font><font>”</font><font> facilities. A sponsored facility is established jointly by the </font><font>issuer of the underlying security and a depositary, whereas a depositary may establish an unsponsored facility without
</font><font>participation by the issuer of the deposited security. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all the costs </font><font>of such facilities and the depositary of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute interest holder </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>communications received from the issuer of the
deposited security or to pass through voting rights to the holders of such </font><font>receipts in respect of the deposited securities. The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not
obligated to disclose </font><font>material information in the U.S. and, therefore, there may be less information available regarding such issuers and there may </font><font>not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts.</font></div> <div><font>Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may </font><font>be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose each
</font><font>Underlying Fund to additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit </font><font>exposure to the depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the
</font><font>programs, currency risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying </font><font>common stock, generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many </font><font>of
the shareholder benefits that come from investing in sponsored depositary receipts.</font></div>
<div><font>Obligations of Foreign Governments, Supranational Entities and Banks</font><font>. The Funds and certain of the Underlying Funds may </font><font>invest in U.S. dollar-denominated short-term obligations issued or
guaranteed by one or more foreign governments or any of </font><font>their political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities that are determined by BFA to be of comparable quality to the
other </font><font>obligations in which such Underlying Funds may invest. Certain foreign governments, specifically foreign governments in </font><font>emerging markets, historically have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld payments of
</font><font>principal and interest, and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. Certain of </font><font>the Underlying Funds may also invest in debt obligations of supranational entities. Supranational entities include
</font><font>international organizations designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or </font><font>development and international banking institutions and related government agencies. Examples include the International </font><font>Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank), the Asian Development Bank and the InterAmerican </font><font>Development Bank. The percentage of the Underlying Funds’ assets
invested in obligations of foreign governments and </font><font>supranational entities will vary depending on the relative yields of such securities, the economic and financial markets of the
</font><font>countries in which the investments are made and the interest rate climate of such countries. Certain of the Underlying Funds </font><font>may invest a portion of their total assets in high-quality, short-term (one year or less) debt obligations of foreign branches of </font><font>U.S. banks or U.S. branches of foreign banks that are denominated in and pay interest in U.S. dollars.</font></div> <div><font>Emerging Markets.</font><font> Some non-U.S. markets in which certain of the Underlying Funds invest are considered to
be emerging </font><font>markets. Investment in these emerging markets subjects an Underlying Fund to a greater risk of loss than investments in </font><font>developed markets. This is due to, among other things, greater market volatility, lower trading volume, political and economic
</font><font>instability, greater risk of market shut down and more governmental limitations on foreign investment policy than those </font><font>typically found in developed markets.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Ratings.
</font><font> </font><font>An investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated
investment-grade by one or more of </font><font>Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited (</font><font>“</font><font>Dominion</font><font>”</font><font>), or another credit rating agency </font><font>designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, or is
unrated but considered to be of </font><font>equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by Moody’s, BBBL or above by Dominion or BBB- or above by </font><font>S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered
</font><font>“</font><font>investment-grade</font><font>”</font><font> securities, bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade </font><font>obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain
speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are </font><font>regarded as having adequate capacity to meet financial commitments.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Subsequent to purchase by the
applicable Underlying Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be </font><font>reduced below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s or below
BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or </font><font>Fitch are generally considered below investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered </font><font>predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of </font><font>the obligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and
</font><font>increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>junk bonds</font><font>”</font><font> and are subject to a </font><font>substantial degree of credit risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P </font><font>Global Ratings, Fitch and Dominion and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</font></div>
<div><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </font><font>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
</font><font>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>CFTC Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </font><font>investment

<div><font>The Funds (the </font><font>“</font><font>No-Action Letter Funds</font><font>”</font><font>) have investments in
</font><font>“</font><font>underlying funds</font><font>”</font><font> (and such underlying funds themselves </font><font>may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term </font><font>“</font><font>underlying fund</font><font>”</font><font> for purposes of the no-action letter </font><font>referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles,
mortgage or international real estate </font><font>investment trusts (</font><font>“</font><font>REITs</font><font>”</font><font>), business development companies and
investment companies that may invest in CFTC </font><font>Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have </font><font>transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of
</font><font>transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in </font><font>such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay
</font><font>registration as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool
operator</font><font>”</font><font> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on </font><font>the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim
</font><font>with the CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or </font><font>regulation as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA in respect of the Funds.</font></div> <div><font>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to
</font><font>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Dodd-Frank Act</font><font>”</font><font>) in the U.S. and under </font><font>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other
</font><font>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </font><font>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </font><font>of
swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </font><font>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a
Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as
defined below) and </font><font>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of
</font><font>“</font><font>senior securities</font><font>”</font><font> under Section 18 of the </font><font>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits
open-end funds, </font><font>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </font><font>“</font><font>senior security,</font><font>”</font><font> other than borrowing from a
bank (subject to a requirement </font><font>to maintain 300% </font><font>“</font><font>asset coverage</font><font>”</font><font>). </font></div>
<div><font>Under Rule 18f-4, </font><font>“</font><font>Derivatives Transactions</font><font>”</font><font> include the following:
(1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </font><font>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the
foregoing, </font><font>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </font><font>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise;
</font><font>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse</font><font> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </font><font>under
Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</font><font> (</font><font>“</font><font>TBA</font><font>”</font><font>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </font><font>physically settle
the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the </font><font>“</font><font>Delayed-Settlement
</font><font>Securities Provision</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
<div><font>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below), the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4
</font><font>with respect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </font><font>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</font><font>“</font><font>DRMP</font><font>”</font><font>) and comply with a relative or absolute
limit on Fund </font><font>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</font><font>“</font><font>VaR</font><font>”</font><font>). The DRMP is administered by a </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives risk manager,</font><font>”</font><font> who is </font><font>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP
and </font><font>reports to the Board.</font></div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4
provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives
exposure</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(as
defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </font><font>adopts and implements written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </font><font>“</font><font>Limited </font><font>Derivatives User Exception</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, an Underlying Fund) </font><font>acquires a
security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time </font><font>and price, thereby determining the yield during the
purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to </font><font>be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the
purchaser. If a repurchase </font><font>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by an </font><font>Underlying Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a </font><font>default by the seller, the Underlying Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition
</font><font>of the collateral.</font></div> <div><font>In any repurchase
transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </font><font>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii)
obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </font><font>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are
</font><font>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </font><font>seven days.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for an Underlying Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the
</font><font>Underlying Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Underlying Funds seek to minimize such risks, but </font><font>because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality
</font><font>collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and </font><font>collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be
</font><font>more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be </font><font>sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, an Underlying Fund would likely retain the status of an
</font><font>unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the position an Underlying Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant </font><font>to its investment policies, other
unsecured debt securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the </font><font>shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, an Underlying Fund would be at risk of losing some
or all of the principal and income </font><font>involved in the transaction.</font></div> <div><font>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </font><font>repurchase the securities at an
agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </font><font>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that each Fund or an Underlying Fund can
recover all or most of the cash invested </font><font>in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund or an </font><font>Underlying Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are
</font><font>advantageous only if each Fund or an Underlying Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from </font><font>these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize
</font><font>earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, </font><font>and each Fund or an Underlying Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
</font><font>advantageous to the Fund or an Underlying Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or </font><font>decrease in the value of each Fund or Underlying Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of
</font><font>leverage, and the proceeds obtained through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</font></div>
<div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits each Fund or an Underlying Fund to enter into reverse repurchase
</font><font>agreements and similar financing transactions (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) </font><font>notwithstanding the limitation on the issuance of senior
securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided </font><font>that each Fund or an Underlying Fund either (i) complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such
</font><font>transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under </font><font>Rule 18f-4. (See </font><font>“</font><font>Regulation
Regarding Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font> above.)</font></div>
<div><font>Securities of Investment Companies. </font><font> </font><font>Each Underlying Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies </font><font>(including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the
</font><font>1940 Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total </font><font>outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one
</font><font>investment company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. Other </font><font>investment companies in which an
</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such
</font><font>as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by an </font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund. </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees
and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in </font><font>connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a
Fund's </font><font>pro rata </font><font>share </font><font>of
the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies</font><font> </font><font>(as disclosed
in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>An Underlying Fund may purchase ETF shares for the same reason it would purchase (and as an alternative to purchasing)
</font><font>futures contracts – to obtain relatively low-cost exposure to the stock market while maintaining flexibility to meet the </font><font>liquidity needs of the Underlying Fund. ETF shares enjoy several advantages over futures contracts. Depending on the market,
</font><font>the holding period, and other factors, ETF shares can be less costly than futures contracts. In addition, ETF shares can be </font><font>purchased for smaller sums and offer exposure to market sectors and styles for which there is no suitable or liquid futures
</font><font>contract. An Underlying Fund may also purchase ETF shares for other purposes, including improving its ability to track its </font><font>underlying index. An Underlying Fund may invest in shares of ETFs that are advised by BFA.</font></div> <div><font>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund and the Underlying Funds may invest in short-term </font><font>instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing
basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money </font><font>market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market
</font><font>funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. </font><font>government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of
</font><font>deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. </font><font>branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </font><font>“</font><font>Prime-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Moody's, </font><font>“</font><font>F-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Fitch, </font><font>or </font><font>“</font><font>A-1</font><font>”</font><font> by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or if unrated, of
comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt </font><font>securities
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more
than 397 days and that </font><font>have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the </font><font>1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including
</font><font>U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a </font><font>Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable
</font><font>deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are </font><font>time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions. See </font><font>Risks of the </font><font>Underlying Funds</font><font> below.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Swap Agreements.</font><font>
 </font><font>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </font><font>the
other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </font><font>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return
(or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </font><font>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with each
Underlying </font><font>Fund receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying </font><font>Fund’s
obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</font></div> <div><font>Certain of the Funds
or Underlying Funds may enter into currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The use of </font><font>swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and
risks different from those associated with </font><font>ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other </font><font>underlying assets.</font></div> <div><font>Tracking
Stocks.</font><font>  </font><font>A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a
specific business unit or </font><font>operating division within a larger company and is designed to </font><font>“</font><font>track</font><font>”</font><font> the performance of such business unit or
division. The </font><font>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </font><font>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the
</font><font>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div> <div><font>U.S. Government Obligations. </font><font> </font><font>The Funds or an Underlying Fund may invest in various types of U.S. government obligations. </font><font>U.S. government obligations are
a type of bond and include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the </font><font>U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of principal and interest
on U.S. government obligations (i) may </font><font>be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the issuing or guaranteeing agency or </font><font>instrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHLB notes). In the latter case, each Fund or an Underlying Fund
</font><font>must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which </font><font>agency or instrumentality may be privately owned. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide </font><font>financial
support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. As a general matter, the value of debt </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>instruments, including U.S. government
obligations, declines when market interest rates increase and rises when market </font><font>interest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S. government obligations are subject to fluctuations in
yield or value due to their </font><font>structure or contract terms.</font></div> <div><font>Future Developments.</font><font>  </font><font>The board of each Fund or Underlying Fund may, in the future, authorize each Underlying Fund to </font><font>invest in securities
contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectuses, provided </font><font>they are consistent with each Fund's or Underlying Fund's investment
objective and do not violate any of its investment </font><font>restrictions or policies.</font></div> <div><font>General Considerations and Risks</font></div> <div><font>A discussion of some
of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus. </font><font>Because each Fund expects to obtain its exposure to the securities
substantially through its investment in the Underlying </font><font>Funds, shareholders should be aware that the risks of investment in particular types of securities, economic sectors and
</font><font>geographic locations discussed below may be borne by the Fund through its investment in the Underlying Funds. Through its </font><font>investment in the Underlying Funds, each Fund will also bear the risks described below associated with the Underlying </font><font>Funds'
use of portfolio management techniques, such as borrowing arrangements and use of derivatives, in addition to the </font><font>risks associated with those activities if the Funds engage in them
directly.</font></div> <div><font>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s
portfolio</font><font> </font><font>securities, including its </font><font>investment in the Underlying Funds, may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the
</font><font>portfolio securities, the value of stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors </font><font>does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</font></div> <div><font>Borrowing Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a
Fund’s portfolio. </font><font>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </font><font>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div><font>Call Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the
Funds or an Underlying Fund may
</font><font>“</font><font>call</font><font>”</font><font> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and a Fund or an Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in
</font><font>securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less </font><font>favorable features.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Commodities Investment Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Exposure to commodities markets may subject a Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund to greater </font><font>volatility than investments in traditional securities. The commodities markets have
experienced periods of extreme volatility. </font><font>Similar future market conditions may result in rapid and substantial valuation increases or decreases in a Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or </font><font>Underlying Fund's
holdings.</font></div> <div><font>The commodities markets may fluctuate widely based on a variety of factors. Movements in commodity
investment prices </font><font>are outside of a Fund's</font><font> </font><font>or Underlying Fund's control and may not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements may be influenced </font><font>by, among other things:
governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies; </font><font>changing market and economic conditions; market liquidity; weather and climate
conditions, including droughts and floods; </font><font>livestock disease; changing supply and demand relationships and levels of domestic production and imported commodities; </font><font>changes in storage costs; the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems; energy conservation; the </font><font>success of exploration projects; changes in international balances of payments and trade; domestic and foreign rates of
</font><font>inflation; currency devaluations and revaluations; domestic and foreign political and economic events; domestic and foreign </font><font>interest rates and/or investor expectations concerning interest rates; foreign currency/exchange rates; domestic and foreign
</font><font>governmental regulation and taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other political upheaval and conflicts; governmental </font><font>expropriation; investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and commodities funds; and changes in
</font><font>philosophies and emotions of market participants. The frequency and magnitude of such changes cannot be predicted.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The prices of commodities can also
fluctuate widely due to supply and demand disruptions in major producing or </font><font>consuming regions. Certain commodities or natural resources may be produced in a limited number of
countries and may be </font><font>controlled by a small number of producers or groups of producers. As a result, political, economic, regulatory and supply-related</font><font> events in such countries could have a disproportionate impact on the prices of such commodities.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>A decrease in the production of a physical
commodity or a decrease in the volume of such commodity available for </font><font>transportation, mining, processing, storage or distribution may adversely impact the financial performance of
a commodity </font><font>or commodity-related company that devotes a portion of its business to that commodity. Production declines and volume </font><font>decreases could be caused by various factors, including catastrophic events affecting production, depletion of resources,
</font><font>labor difficulties, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment failures and unexpected maintenance </font><font>problems, import supply disruption, governmental expropriation, political upheaval or conflicts or increased competition
</font><font>from alternative energy sources or commodity prices. Agricultural commodities may be adversely affected by weather or </font><font>other natural phenomena, such as drought, floods and pests.</font></div> <div><font>A sustained decline in demand for such commodities could also adversely affect the financial performance of
commodity-related</font><font> companies. Factors that could lead to a decline in demand include economic recession or other adverse economic </font><font>conditions, higher taxes on commodities or increased governmental regulations, increases in fuel economy, consumer shifts </font><font>to
the use of alternative commodities or fuel sources, changes in commodity prices, or weather.</font></div> <div><font>The commodity
markets are subject to temporary distortions and other disruptions due to, among other factors, lack of </font><font>liquidity, the participation of speculators, and government regulation and
other actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some </font><font>foreign exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices which may occur in a single business day </font><font>(generally referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>daily price
fluctuation limits</font><font>”</font><font>). The maximum or minimum price of a contract as a result of these </font><font>limits is referred to as a </font><font>“</font><font>limit price.</font><font>”</font><font> If the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made </font><font>beyond the limit price. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of </font><font>contracts at disadvantageous times or prices.</font></div> <div><font>Custody Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling
trades and to the holding of </font><font>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </font><font>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </font><font>hold
securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </font><font>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be
subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </font><font>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses
of </font><font>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </font><font>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than
</font><font>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </font><font>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue
</font><font>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </font><font>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </font><font>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </font><font>goes bankrupt. Each Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim </font><font>for
compensation.</font></div> <div><font>Extension Risk. </font><font> </font><font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more
slowly </font><font>than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in a Fund’s or Underlying </font><font>Fund's income and potentially in the value of a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> <div><font>Illiquid Investments Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </font><font>would have invested more
than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </font><font>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market
conditions in seven calendar days or less without </font><font>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </font><font>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the
</font><font>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </font><font>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </font><font>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Reference Rate
Replacement Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently </font><font>transitioned from, or continue to be tied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>LIBOR</font><font>”</font><font>) to determine payment obligations, </font><font>financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority
(</font><font>“</font><font>FCA</font><font>”</font><font>), which </font><font>regulates LIBOR, has ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the FCA announced that some USD
LIBOR </font><font>settings will continue to be published under a synthetic methodology until September 30, 2024 for certain legacy contracts. </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>SOFR</font><font>”</font><font>), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight </font><font>collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the
repurchase agreement market, has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis </font><font>in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory fallback
mechanism to replace </font><font>LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts.</font></div>
<div><font>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing
LIBOR-based</font><font> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </font><font>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to
</font><font>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </font><font>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing
</font><font>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </font><font>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </font><font>or an Underlying Fund may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in
</font><font>the future.</font></div> <div><font>Operational
Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating
errors such as </font><font>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </font><font>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management
</font><font>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </font><font>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of
</font><font>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </font><font>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </font><font>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
</font><font>occurrence or effects.</font></div>
<div><font>Prepayment Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay
principal prior to the </font><font>security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund or an Underlying Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or </font><font>higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's income or return potential. Also, if a security </font><font>subject to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of
</font><font>prepayment.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of
Derivatives. </font><font> </font><font>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is
derived from, the value of an </font><font>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </font><font>such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). The Funds and certain Underlying Funds may invest in stock index futures
</font><font>contracts, securities options and other derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in </font><font>interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund's losses may be greater if it </font><font>invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional
securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which </font><font>is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives
generally involve the </font><font>incurrence of leverage.</font></div> <div><font>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by
</font><font>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </font><font>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not
</font><font>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </font><font>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging </font><font>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</font></div> <div><font>Risks of Equity Securities. </font><font> </font><font>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of an Underlying </font><font>Fund's portfolio securities may
fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio </font><font>securities, the value of preferred or common stocks in general and other factors
that affect the market. An investment in a </font><font>Fund should also be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk </font><font>that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may
</font><font>deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of an </font><font>Underlying Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and </font><font>decreases
in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on </font><font>various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding
government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>14</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>inflation and interest rates, economic expansion
or contraction and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. </font><font>Holders of common stocks incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because
common </font><font>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from the issuer inferior to the rights of creditors or holders of debt </font><font>obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at
</font><font>maturity (whose value, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have </font><font>a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have </font><font>neither a
fixed principal amount nor a maturity.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</font><font>  </font><font>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </font><font>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in
futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </font><font>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize
futures </font><font>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </font><font>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of
</font><font>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </font><font>a Fund's underlying instrument. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make </font><font>daily
cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell </font><font>portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a
time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund </font><font>may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div><font>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, selling uncovered stock index
</font><font>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </font><font>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a
</font><font>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </font><font>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a
</font><font>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </font><font>invest.</font></div> <div><font>Utilization of futures and options on futures
by a Fund involves the risk of loss of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy </font><font>of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase
of put or call options will </font><font>be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</font></div>
<div><font>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </font><font>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial
</font><font>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </font><font>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </font><font>previous
day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </font><font>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price
beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </font><font>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing
prompt liquidation of </font><font>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </font><font>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities. </font><font> </font><font>Non-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the </font><font>respective countries covered by a Fund or an
Underlying Fund. The risks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities typically </font><font>include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in
interest rates and </font><font>perceived trends in bond prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain </font><font>risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include securities </font><font>markets that may lack sufficient liquidity or may be less efficient; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available </font><font>information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of
</font><font>funds or other assets of a Fund or an Underlying Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in </font><font>settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market
</font><font>capitalization of most non-U.S. securities markets; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of </font><font>the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social,
</font><font>economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and different bankruptcy and </font><font>insolvency regimes which may stay or prevent recovery in the event of an issuer’s default. </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S.
Equity Securities. </font><font> </font><font>An investment in non-U.S. equity securities involves risks similar
to those of </font><font>investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by </font><font>such factors as economic and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived
</font><font>trends in stock prices.</font></div> <div><font>Investing in
securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in </font><font>currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails
certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the </font><font>investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations
include favorable or </font><font>unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be </font><font>incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Because certain Underlying Funds invest in non-U.S.
</font><font>equity securities, investing in any of the Funds also involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with </font><font>investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and </font><font>less efficient securities markets; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the
</font><font>imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the </font><font> </font><font>Underlying Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement
procedures; difficulties in </font><font>enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different accounting and </font><font>disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the
</font><font>economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of </font><font>nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Swap Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </font><font>Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk
that the swap </font><font>counterparty will default on its obligations. If such a default occurs, a
Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund will have contractual </font><font>remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and
</font><font>insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or Underlying Fund's rights as a creditor (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund
</font><font>may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</font></div> <div><font>A Fund or an Underlying Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified
</font><font>liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a </font><font>Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying
Fund's investment in swaps.</font></div> <div><font>Tracking Error Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>The Underlying Funds may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a fund’s
performance </font><font>from that of its underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </font><font>instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in an Underlying Fund’s underlying index, pricing differences, </font><font>transaction costs incurred by the Underlying Funds, Underlying Funds’ holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of </font><font>the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest received by an Underlying Fund or distributions paid to an Underlying
</font><font>Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize </font><font>the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to an Underlying Fund’s underlying </font><font>index or the costs to an Underlying Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be
</font><font>heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result </font><font>because a fund incurs fees and expenses, while such a fund’s underlying index does not. When an issuer is introduced by an </font><font>index provider into an index tracked by an Underlying Funds, BFA may conduct an analysis on such issuer’s securities to
</font><font>identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not appear to be supported </font><font>by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short interest or lending
</font><font>activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be indicators of possible </font><font>irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index
provider </font><font>has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to continue to include the issuer’s securities in the re-balancing of its </font><font>index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from an
</font><font>Underlying Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to increased tracking error due to the divergence in </font><font>the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s under-weighting or excluding such securities may </font><font>result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the above-mentioned analysis and screening to an
</font><font>Underlying Fund and its underlying index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates (without any guarantees). The </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>analysis and screening may not exclude any or all
high risk securities from an Underlying Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion </font><font>of such securities will result in an adverse impact to such a Fund’s net asset value if one
or more such securities declines in </font><font>value.</font></div> <div><font>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </font><font> </font><font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, </font><font>times of issuance and other
characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the </font><font>U.S. government may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to
decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ </font><font>by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury
</font><font>obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing </font><font>arrangements, a downgrade could also result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the
</font><font>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and global economy.</font></div> <div><font>A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost </font><font>higher
and lead the government to issue additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises </font><font>concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to make
principal or interest payments when they are due. If market </font><font>participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could
decline, </font><font>thus increasing inflationary pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported </font><font>goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic
</font><font>downturns. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </font><font>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period that
</font><font>shareholders own shares of a Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of </font><font>the U.S., circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal, such as reaching the
</font><font>legislative </font><font>“</font><font>debt ceiling.</font><font>”</font><font> Such non-payment would result in losses to a Fund and substantial negative consequences for the </font><font>U.S. economy and the global financial system.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Africa.</font><font>  </font><font>Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks </font><font>including, among others,
expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including </font><font>authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,
armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as </font><font>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries,
</font><font>genocidal warfare.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Certain countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and,
</font><font>consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of </font><font>countries in Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those
</font><font>markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated </font><font>with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and </font><font>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended
</font><font>altogether.</font></div> <div><font>Market volatility may also be
heightened by the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in </font><font>Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more
developed markets. Since a Fund or an </font><font>Underlying Fund may need to effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms, a Fund or an Underlying Fund is </font><font>subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to a Fund or an Underlying Fund (</font><font>i.e., </font><font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund or an Underlying Fund effects
securities transactions </font><font>through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</font></div> <div><font>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in
</font><font>securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental </font><font>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign
</font><font>investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an </font><font>issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries
</font><font>and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay </font><font>investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund or an Underlying Fund may not be able to invest in certain
</font><font>securities while approval is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license </font><font>that enables a Fund or an Underlying Fund to invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers located or
</font><font>operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>and any one of these factors could cause a decline
in the value of a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's investments. Issuers </font><font>located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and regulations as
issuers located or </font><font>operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with </font><font>regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are generally not subject to the uniform
</font><font>accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed </font><font>countries.</font></div> <div><font>In addition, governments of certain
countries in Africa in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund may invest may levy </font><font>withholding or other taxes on income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although
in certain countries in </font><font>Africa a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income </font><font>received from investments in such countries.</font></div>
<div><font>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater degree of risk associated with governmental approval in
</font><font>connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In </font><font>addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s balance of payments declines, such African country may impose
</font><font>temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund or an Underlying Fund could be adversely </font><font>affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the
</font><font>application to the Fund </font><font> </font><font>or the Underlying Funds of any restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in </font><font>Africa may require a
Fund or an Underlying Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local government approvals or take other </font><font>actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund or an Underlying
Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new and unsettled and, consequently, there is
a risk of rapid and </font><font>unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. </font><font>Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be
</font><font>no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of </font><font>corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to
</font><font>which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such </font><font>countries may not receive many of the protections available to shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries.
</font><font>Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable </font><font>enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in </font><font>Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</font></div>
<div><font>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </font><font>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and
</font><font>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </font><font>and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries
</font><font>in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. </font><font>These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In
</font><font>addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund invests may operate in, or have </font><font>dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, </font><font>and/or
countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage </font><font>to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which
operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund or an Underlying </font><font>Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div>
<div><font>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector
</font><font>and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic
</font><font>conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of </font><font>diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may
</font><font>be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</font></div> <div><font>Political instability and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused and may in the future cause significant
</font><font>disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries </font><font>in those countries and adversely impacted the region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has
</font><font>further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly </font><font>through the region, and that developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some
</font><font>protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>risk to investments in the region. Continued
political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and </font><font>terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment
in a Fund or an Underlying </font><font>Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Asia.</font><font>  </font><font> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </font><font>with investments in
securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</font><font> </font><font>include, among others,
expropriation and/or </font><font>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </font><font>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</font><font> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian
</font><font>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </font><font>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div> <div><font>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </font><font>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and
</font><font>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </font><font>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions
</font><font>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </font><font>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on
</font><font>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </font><font>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </font><font>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities
</font><font>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </font><font>the performance of investments in this region.</font></div> <div><font>Certain
governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </font><font>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial
influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </font><font>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on
</font><font>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </font><font>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</font></div> <div><font>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may
</font><font>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </font><font>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking
</font><font>sectors.</font></div> <div><font>Some economies in this region
are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </font><font>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable
to any weakening in global demand </font><font>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </font><font>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries
</font><font>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </font><font>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in
</font><font>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </font><font> </font><font>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </font><font>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
</font><font>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service and tourism
</font><font>industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, </font><font>such as drought and flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of
</font><font>Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by the
relevant</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Funds. The economies of </font><font>Australia and New Zealand are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. The
</font><font>economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting </font><font>foreign ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may </font><font>dissuade
foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which the Underlying Funds have </font><font>exposure.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Central and
South America. </font><font> </font><font>The economies of certain Central and South American countries have
</font><font>experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high
</font><font>unemployment rates and political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities </font><font>(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of the region's exports and many economies in this region
</font><font>are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant </font><font>adverse effect on other countries of this region.</font></div> <div><font>The
governments of certain countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of </font><font>the private sector and may own or control many companies.
Future government actions could have a significant effect on the </font><font>economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on the securities in which the Fund or an
</font><font>Underlying Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and </font><font>South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including
</font><font>organized crime.</font></div> <div><font>Certain countries in
Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have </font><font>been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange
controls, managed adjustments in relative </font><font>currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These </font><font>countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they
</font><font>trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which the Underlying Fund invests may </font><font>be the subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities
</font><font>and the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the </font><font>U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. </font><font>An
issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. The </font><font>Underlying Funds may be adversely affected if they invest in
such issuers.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in China. </font><font> </font><font>Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and </font><font>special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks include,
</font><font>among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and </font><font>social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring countries.</font></div> <div><font>Military conflicts, either in response to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic
</font><font>development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes </font><font>with Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people </font><font>in
Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal, </font><font>and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have
increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of </font><font>the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and
Chinese </font><font>markets. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has made threats of invasion. </font><font>Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may
</font><font>adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia </font><font>and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is
</font><font>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and </font><font>threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </font><font>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of
</font><font>securities in which an Underlying Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal </font><font>instability within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the
</font><font>performance of the Chinese economy.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign
</font><font>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there
</font><font>can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of </font><font>companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private
</font><font>sector and may own or control many companies. Chinese companies, such as those in the financial services or technology </font><font>sectors, and potentially other sectors in the future, are subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their
</font><font>operations and structure. The Chinese government continues to maintain a major role in economic policymaking, and
</font><font>investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the </font><font>imposition of restrictions on foreign investments</font><font> </font><font>and on repatriation of capital invested.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>A Fund may invest in securities issued by variable
interest entities
(</font><font>“</font><font>VIEs</font><font>”</font><font>), which are subject to the investment risks </font><font>associated with the underlying Chinese operating company. A VIE enters into
service contracts and other contracts with the </font><font>Chinese operating company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE has no equity ownership </font><font>of the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating </font><font>company
into its financial statements. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect </font><font>the Chinese operating company’s performance and the
enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese </font><font>company.</font></div> <div><font>In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and </font><font>other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China, including Chinese companies that are listed on </font><font>U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider
</font><font>trading rules, tender offer regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the </font><font>requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. Securities markets in China are in the process of
</font><font>change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions </font><font>and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese
</font><font>companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Underlying Funds are not actively managed and do not </font><font>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> <div><font>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will
</font><font>recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy </font><font>and securities market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products
</font><font>and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers</font><font> </font><font>(including as a result of heightened trade tensions </font><font>between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese
cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies </font><font>of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities
in </font><font>which a Fund or Underlying Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. </font><font>Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s </font><font>“</font><font>Entity List,</font><font>”</font><font> which is a list of companies
believed to pose a </font><font>national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy. </font><font>Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay
</font><font>settlement or cause market disruptions.</font></div>
<div><font>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of China (</font><font>“</font><font>PRC</font><font>”</font><font>) are subject to change, including the issuance of </font><font>authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect.
The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of </font><font>such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary </font><font>over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect
</font><font>on a Fund or an Underlying Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents.</font><font> In addition, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese </font><font>companies may
be less rigorous, and may result in significant differences between financial statements prepared in </font><font>accordance with the PRC accounting standards and practice and those prepared in
accordance with international accounting </font><font>standards.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets.</font><font>  </font><font>Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest in H-shares (securities of </font><font>companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated
in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong </font><font>Kong (</font><font>“</font><font>SEHK</font><font>”</font><font>)), A-shares (securities of companies
incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on </font><font>the Shanghai Stock Exchange
(</font><font>“</font><font>SSE</font><font>”</font><font>) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>SZSE</font><font>”</font><font>)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies
</font><font>incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the </font><font>SZSE) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). The Underlying Funds may also invest in certain Hong Kong-listed securities </font><font>known
as Red-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are </font><font>controlled, directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the
national government or local governments in the PRC and derive </font><font>substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies that
are </font><font>incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive </font><font>substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into two classes: A-shares, which are mostly limited to domestic
investors, </font><font>and B-shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A-shares market is generally subject to </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>greater government restrictions, including trading
suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B-shares </font><font>market is generally smaller and less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A-shares market, which may
lead to </font><font>significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at </font><font>significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the
</font><font>ability to obtain a </font><font>“</font><font>back-door
listing</font><font>”</font><font> through Red-Chips or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an </font><font>experiment in economic reform. </font><font>“</font><font>Back-door
listing</font><font>”</font><font> is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or </font><font>P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the
</font><font>political and economic policies in China. Market developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government </font><font>intervention (including the possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may
</font><font>make it difficult to acquire, dispose of or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to the Fund.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Certain of the Underlying Funds may
invest in A-shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>Shanghai Connect</font><font>”</font><font>) or the Shenzhen-Hong Kong
Stock Connect program (</font><font>“</font><font>Shenzhen Connect,</font><font>”</font><font> and together with </font><font>Shanghai Connect, </font><font>“</font><font>Stock Connect</font><font>”</font><font>). Stock Connect is a securities trading and clearing program with an aim to achieve </font><font>mutual stock market access between the
PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and </font><font>Clearing Limited, the SSE (in the case of Shanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case of Shenzhen Connect),
and China </font><font>Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (</font><font>“</font><font>CSDCC</font><font>”</font><font>). Under Stock Connect, the Fund’s
trading of eligible A-shares</font><font> listed on the SSE or the SZSE, as applicable, would be effectuated through its Hong Kong brokers. Investing in A-shares</font><font> through Stock Connect is subject to trading, clearance, settlement and other procedures, which could pose risks to </font><font>the
Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Although no individual investment quotas or licensing requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect,
trading through </font><font>Stock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the </font><font>“</font><font>Daily Quota</font><font>”</font><font>), which limits the maximum net
purchases under Stock Connect </font><font>each day. The Daily Quota does not belong to the Fund and is utilized on a first-come-first-serve basis. As such, buy orders </font><font>for A-shares would be rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded (although the Fund will be permitted to sell A-shares
</font><font>regardless of the Daily Quota balance). The Daily Quota may restrict the Fund’s ability to invest in A-shares through Stock </font><font>Connect on a timely basis, which could affect the Fund’s ability to effectively pursue its investment strategy. The Daily Quota </font><font>is also subject to change.</font></div> <div><font>A-shares purchased through
Stock Connect generally may only be sold or otherwise transferred through Stock Connect and </font><font>in accordance with applicable rules. In order to comply with applicable local market
rules and to facilitate orderly operations </font><font>of the Fund, including the timely settlement of Stock Connect trades placed by or on behalf of the Fund, BFA utilizes an </font><font>operating model that will only be used by iShares ETFs with investments in A-shares through Stock Connect. Such operating
</font><font>model may reduce the risks of trade failures; however, it will also allow Stock Connect trades to be settled without prior </font><font>verification by the Fund. Accordingly, this operating model may subject the Fund to additional risks, including an increased
</font><font>risk of inadvertently exceeding certain trade or other restrictions or limits placed on the Fund and/or its affiliates, and a </font><font>heightened risk of erroneous trades, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>While A-shares must be designated as eligible to be traded through Stock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed on the SSE,
</font><font>the </font><font>“</font><font>SSE Securities,</font><font>”</font><font> and such eligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the </font><font>“</font><font>SZSE Securities</font><font>”</font><font>), those A-shares may also lose such </font><font>designation, and if this occurs, such A-shares may be sold but could no longer be
purchased through Stock Connect. With </font><font>respect to sell orders through Stock Connect, the SEHK carries out pre-trade checks to ensure an investor has sufficient A-shares</font><font> in its account before the market opens on the trading day. Accordingly, if there are insufficient A-shares in an
</font><font>investor’s account before the market opens on the trading day, the sell order will be rejected, which may adversely impact the </font><font>Fund’s performance.</font></div> <div><font>In addition, Stock Connect
operates only on days when both the Chinese and the Hong Kong markets are open for trading </font><font>and when banking services are available in both markets on the corresponding settlement
days. Therefore, an investment in </font><font>A-shares through Stock Connect may subject the Fund to the risk of price fluctuations on days when the Chinese markets </font><font>are open, but Stock Connect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading through
</font><font>Stock Connect under certain circumstances. Where such a suspension of trading is effected, the Fund’s ability to access A-shares</font><font> through Stock Connect will be adversely affected. In addition, if one or both of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets </font><font>are
closed on a U.S. trading day, the Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of A-shares through Stock Connect in a </font><font>timely manner, which could adversely affect the Fund’s
performance.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>22</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The Fund’s investments in A-shares through
Stock Connect are held by its custodian in accounts in the Central Clearing and </font><font>Settlement System
(</font><font>“</font><font>CCASS</font><font>”</font><font>) maintained by the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (</font><font>“</font><font>HKSCC</font><font>”</font><font>), which in turn </font><font>holds the A-shares, as the nominee holder, through an omnibus securities account in its name registered with the CSDCC. </font><font>The
precise nature and rights of the Fund as the beneficial owner of the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities through HKSCC as </font><font>nominee is not well defined under PRC law. There is a lack
of a clear definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership </font><font>and beneficial ownership under PRC law, and there have been few cases involving a nominee account structure in
the PRC </font><font>courts. The exact nature and methods of enforcement of the rights and interests of the Fund under PRC law is also uncertain. </font><font>In the unlikely event that HKSCC becomes subject to winding up proceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that the SSE
</font><font>Securities or SZSE Securities may not be regarded as held for the beneficial ownership of the Fund or as part of the general </font><font>assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors.</font></div> <div><font>Notwithstanding the fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary interests in the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in its
</font><font>omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar for SSE- or SZSE-listed companies will still treat </font><font>HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions in respect of such SSE Securities or SZSE Securities.
</font><font>HKSCC monitors the corporate actions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE Securities and keeps participants of CCASS
</font><font>informed of all such corporate actions that require CCASS participants to take steps in order to participate in them. The Fund </font><font>will therefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement and notification and implementation of corporate actions.</font></div> <div><font>The HKSCC is responsible for the clearing, settlement and provision of depositary, nominee and other related services of the
</font><font>trades executed by Hong Kong market participants and investors. Accordingly, investors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE </font><font>Securities directly; rather, they are held through their brokers’ or custodians’ accounts with CCASS. The HKSCC and the </font><font>CSDCC establish clearing links and each has become a participant of the other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-border</font><font> trades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC be declared as a defaulter, HKSCC’s liabilities in Stock Connect under its
</font><font>market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against </font><font>the CSDCC. In that event, the Fund may suffer delays in the recovery process or may not be able to fully recover its losses
</font><font>from the CSDCC.</font></div> <div><font>Market participants are
able to participate in Stock Connect subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk </font><font>management and other requirements as may be specified by the relevant
exchange and/or clearing house. Further, the </font><font>“</font><font>connectivity</font><font>”</font><font> in Stock Connect requires the routing of orders across the borders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This requires </font><font>the development of new information technology systems on the part of the SEHK and exchange participants. There is no
</font><font>assurance that these systems will function properly or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both </font><font>markets. In the event that the relevant systems fail to function properly, trading in A-shares through Stock Connect could be
</font><font>disrupted, and the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective may be adversely affected.</font></div> <div><font>The Shanghai Connect program, launched in November 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in December </font><font>2016, do not
have an extensive operating history. Stock Connect is subject to regulations promulgated by regulatory </font><font>authorities and implementation rules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC
and Hong Kong. There is no certainty as to </font><font>how the current regulations will be applied or interpreted going forward, and new or revised regulations may be issued from </font><font>time to time by the regulators and stock exchanges in China and Hong Kong in connection with operations, legal </font><font>enforcement
and cross-border trades under Stock Connect. In addition, there can be no assurance that Stock Connect will </font><font>not be discontinued. The Fund may be adversely affected as a result of
such changes. Furthermore, the securities regimes </font><font>and legal systems of China and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on these differences. Further, </font><font>different fees, costs and taxes are imposed on foreign investors acquiring A-shares through Stock Connect, and these fees,
</font><font>costs and taxes may be higher than comparable fees, costs and taxes imposed on owners of other Chinese securities
</font><font>providing similar investment exposure.</font></div> <div><font>A-Share Market Suspension Risk.</font></div>
<div><font>A-shares may only be bought from, or sold to, the Fund at times when the relevant A-shares may be sold or purchased on
</font><font>the relevant Chinese stock exchange. The A-shares market can have a higher propensity for trading suspensions than many </font><font>other global equity markets. Trading suspensions in certain stocks could lead to greater market execution risk, valuation risks </font><font>and liquidity risks and costs for the Fund, as well as for Authorized Participants that create and redeem Creation Units of the </font><font>Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily limit, set at 10%, of the amount of fluctuation permitted in the prices of A-shares</font><font> during a single trading day. The daily limit refers to price movements only and does not restrict trading within the
</font><font>relevant limit. There can be no assurance that a liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular A-share or for any </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>particular time. This could increase an Underlying
Fund’s tracking error and/or cause the Fund to trade in the market at </font><font>greater bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Given that the
A-shares market is considered </font><font>volatile and unstable (with the risk of widespread trading suspensions or government intervention), the creation and </font><font>redemption of Creation Units may also be disrupted.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </font><font> </font><font>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </font><font>economic pressures. These countries generally
tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the </font><font>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies
</font><font>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </font><font>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
</font><font>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </font><font>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial
</font><font>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </font><font>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </font><font>economic
health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </font><font>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high
debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </font><font>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a
</font><font>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </font><font>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen
</font><font>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </font><font>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the
</font><font>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </font><font>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain
</font><font>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </font><font>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </font><font>developed
countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </font><font>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic
growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </font><font>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Eastern Europe. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly </font><font>speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe.
</font><font>Certain Eastern European countries have high public debt levels, significant underground economies, high unemployment </font><font>and emigration of skilled workers. Such countries generally have a history of political instability, limited infrastructure and an </font><font>inefficient public sector prone to endemic corruption. Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite
</font><font>trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments </font><font>have expropriated substantial amounts of private property, and many claims of the property owners have never been fully
</font><font>settled.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market economies at different paces with different </font><font>characteristics.
Many Eastern European securities markets are generally underdeveloped with low, irregular trading volumes, </font><font>dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate
information. Eastern European securities markets are </font><font>generally subject to less government supervision and regulation and may be less liquid and more volatile than securities
</font><font>markets in the U.S. or Western European countries. Legal institutions governing private and foreign investments and private </font><font>property may be relatively nascent, inefficient, and unevenly enforced or inequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European
</font><font>governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many </font><font>companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which
</font><font>could have a negative impact on a Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund's investments. Information and transaction costs, differential </font><font>taxes, and sometimes political or
transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign </font><font>investor.</font></div> <div><font>Eastern European economies may also be particularly susceptible to changes in the international credit markets due to their
</font><font>reliance on bank related inflows of capital. Changes to the economies of countries with substantial foreign direct investment </font><font>in certain Eastern European countries may negatively affect the region’s economy. The economy of certain Eastern European </font><font>countries may be adversely affected by global prices for manufactured goods or commodity price declines to the extent that </font><font>a
country relies on the export of such products.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>24</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Geopolitical events, including war, and other
instability in certain Eastern European countries may cause uncertainty in the </font><font>region’s financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a
Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund has </font><font>exposure. These markets may be particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and currency events in Russia and may
</font><font>suffer heavy losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia has </font><font>historically asserted its influence in the region using diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of
</font><font>national power, as it did with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014, and most recently on February </font><font>24, 2022.</font></div> <div><font>Russian Invasion of
Ukraine</font><font>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </font><font>of the
military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </font><font>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are
impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </font><font>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and
threatened responses to such </font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </font><font>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for
</font><font>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </font><font> </font><font>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </font><font>investments in developed countries. These
risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </font><font>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such
securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </font><font>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </font><font>regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors
</font><font>and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local </font><font>governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be
</font><font>subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by </font><font>local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there
</font><font>may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </font><font>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the
</font><font>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </font><font>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </font><font>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </font><font>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Underlying Funds are not actively managed
</font><font>and do not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> <div><font>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume
</font><font>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </font><font>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in
</font><font>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </font><font>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher
</font><font>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </font><font>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in
</font><font>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </font><font>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </font><font>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the
</font><font>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </font><font>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in
</font><font>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </font><font>emerging market country securities may also affect an Underlying Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or </font><font>to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</font></div>
<div><font>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </font><font>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and
</font><font>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less
</font><font>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </font><font>“</font><font>sovereign</font><font>”</font><font> assets. Certain emerging market

<div> <div><font>countries in the past have expropriated large
amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </font><font>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</font></div>
<div><font>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees.
</font><font>These restrictions may limit an Underlying Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the </font><font>expenses of the</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund.
Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by </font><font>foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an
issuer's outstanding securities or </font><font>a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company </font><font>available for purchase by nationals.</font></div> <div><font>Many emerging
market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </font><font>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused
by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </font><font>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i)
</font><font>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </font><font>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </font><font>imposition
of trade barriers.</font></div> <div><font>An
</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will
be subject to applicable taxation </font><font>in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be </font><font>available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</font></div> <div><font>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there
</font><font>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </font><font>difficult to conduct such transactions.</font></div> <div><font>In the past,
certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </font><font>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending
programs, which in the past have caused huge </font><font>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </font><font>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </font><font>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these
</font><font>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </font><font>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary
</font><font>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </font><font>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of
</font><font>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Europe. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in European countries may expose an Underlying Fund to the economic and political </font><font>risks associated with Europe in
general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets </font><font>of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one
European country can have an </font><font>adverse impact on other European countries. An Underlying Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are </font><font>domiciled in, have significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the </font><font>European Union (the </font><font>“</font><font>EU</font><font>”</font><font>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union </font><font>(the </font><font>“</font><font>eurozone</font><font>”</font><font>) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with </font><font>restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may
</font><font>significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations </font><font>on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the
</font><font>eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an </font><font>EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading </font><font>partners.
Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the </font><font>criteria for joining the eurozone.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Consequently, these countries must
comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </font><font>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government
debt levels and the </font><font>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </font><font>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain
</font><font>countries, without prior warning, can institute </font><font>“</font><font>capital controls.</font><font>”</font><font> Countries may use these
controls to restrict volatile </font><font>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect an Underlying Fund’s </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>investments. A default or debt restructuring by
any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt </font><font>and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be
located in countries other than </font><font>those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events </font><font>have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of
</font><font>every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial </font><font>problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce </font><font>the
desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended </font><font>consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by
governments and other entities of their debt could have additional </font><font>adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more
countries </font><font>may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly </font><font>fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of an Underlying Fund’s </font><font>investments in the region.</font></div> <div><font>The United Kingdom (the
</font><font>“</font><font>U.K.</font><font>”</font><font>) left the EU (</font><font>“</font><font>Brexit</font><font>”</font><font>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or </font><font>worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political
</font><font>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</font></div> <div><font>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were
</font><font>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </font><font>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example,
</font><font>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may
</font><font>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </font><font>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact
</font><font>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</font><font> </font><font>and could adversely affect </font><font>the
value and liquidity of a Fund's or Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> <div><font>Russian Invasion of
Ukraine</font><font>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </font><font>of the
military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </font><font>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are
impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </font><font>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and
threatened responses to such </font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which an Underlying Fund </font><font>invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact
</font><font>the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, </font><font>and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in India. </font><font> </font><font>India is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in </font><font>comparison to more
developed markets. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has recently </font><font>experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with
certain of its neighboring countries, including </font><font>Pakistan, and the Indian government has confronted separatist movements in several Indian states, including Kashmir and </font><font>Punjab. Government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or
</font><font>expropriation of assets offer higher potential for losses. Governmental actions could have a negative effect on the economic </font><font>conditions in India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of investments made by an Underlying Fund. The
</font><font>securities markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped and with some exceptions, consist of a small number of listed </font><font>companies with small market capitalization, greater price volatility and substantially less liquidity than companies in more
</font><font>developed markets. Stockbrokers and other intermediaries in India may not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S. </font><font>or other, more developed countries. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may also affect an Underlying
</font><font>Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price or time that it desires or an Underlying Fund’s ability to track its </font><font>underlying index.</font></div> <div><font>Global factors and foreign actions
may inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In </font><font>addition, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian
companies, which may decrease the </font><font>liquidity of an Underlying Fund’s portfolio and result in extreme volatility in the prices of Indian securities. In November 2016, </font><font>the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>financial markets. These factors, coupled with the
lack of extensive accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards </font><font>and practices, as applicable in the U.S., may increase the risk of loss for a Fund.</font></div>
<div><font>Securities laws in India are relatively new and unsettled and, as a result, there is a risk of significant and
unpredictable change </font><font>in laws governing foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Foreign investors in </font><font>particular may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. Certain Indian regulatory approvals, including
</font><font>approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (</font><font>“</font><font>SEBI</font><font>”</font><font>), the central government and the tax
authorities (to the </font><font>extent that tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before an Underlying Fund can make investments in Indian </font><font>companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</font></div> <div><font>Technology and software sectors represent a significant portion of the total capitalization of the Indian securities markets.
</font><font>The value of these companies will generally fluctuate in response to technological and regulatory developments, and, as a </font><font>result, an Underlying Fund’s holdings are expected to experience correlated fluctuations.</font></div> <div><font>Natural disasters, such as tsunamis, flooding or droughts, could occur in India or surrounding areas and could negatively
</font><font>affect the Indian economy or operations of a Subsidiary, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Japan. </font><font> </font><font>Japan may be subject to political, economic, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually </font><font>or in the aggregate,
can impact an investment made in Japan.</font> <br/><font> </font></div> <div><font>Currency Risk</font><font>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a
decline in exports </font><font>that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain </font><font>or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate
</font><font>sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</font> <br/><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Economic Risk</font><font>. The growth of
Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed </font><font>economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low
relative to other advanced economies, and </font><font>it may remain low in the future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely </font><font>affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions </font><font>of
its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a </font><font>negative impact on the Japanese economy.</font> <br/><font> </font></div> <div><font>Geographic
Risk</font><font>. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or
</font><font>surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</font> <br/><font> </font></div> <div><font>Labor Risk</font><font>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor
</font><font>market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime </font><font>employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic
</font><font>competitiveness.</font> <br/></div>
<div><font>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk</font><font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with </font><font>large levels of nonperforming loans,
over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major </font><font>corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may
cause a </font><font>slowdown of the Japanese economy.</font> <br/><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Political Risk</font><font>. Historically, Japan
has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future </font><font>political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect an
Underlying Fund’s investments. In </font><font>addition, China has become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has </font><font>been strained. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as
</font><font>a whole.</font> <br/><font> </font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. </font><font> </font><font>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political </font><font>and legal systems in such countries
may have an adverse impact on a Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund. Many economies in the
</font><font>Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil </font><font>and natural gas, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign
</font><font>currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly </font><font>impacted.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have
exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many </font><font>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control
many companies, </font><font>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a </font><font>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a
</font><font>Fund</font><font> </font><font>or an
Underlying Fund, as well as the value of securities in such Underlying Funds' portfolios.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of
</font><font>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </font><font>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in
</font><font>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</font></div> <div><font>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on an Underlying Fund. For example,
</font><font>the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the </font><font>amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern
</font><font>countries. Certain Underlying Funds therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation </font><font>in which it invests for an amount greater than their actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in </font><font>Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible
</font><font>to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose </font><font>substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as an </font><font>Underlying Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons </font><font>or
limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit </font><font>investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of
securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms </font><font>(including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern
country.</font></div> <div><font>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as
well as limitations on </font><font>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of an Underlying Fund. For example, in certain of these </font><font>countries, an Underlying Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the
</font><font>shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of the Underlying Funds. Re-registration in some instances may not be </font><font>possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which an Underlying Fund may be denied certain of its rights as
</font><font>an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances </font><font>where an Underlying Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the
</font><font>permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, an Underlying Fund </font><font>may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to an Underlying Fund’s ability to
repatriate </font><font>investment income or capital gains. An</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any </font><font>required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund of any
</font><font>restrictions on investment.</font></div> <div><font>Certain
Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </font><font>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange
controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </font><font>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have
been </font><font>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </font><font>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which an Underlying Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings
</font><font>with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or </font><font>countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its
</font><font>reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. An </font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund, as an </font><font>investor
in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained
relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, </font><font>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely
affect the economies </font><font>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as </font><font>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for
</font><font>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </font><font>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial,
political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign </font><font>intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing
in Russia. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk
and special </font><font>considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly </font><font>speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private
</font><font>property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of an Underlying Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result </font><font>of expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund’s investment opportunities, including, </font><font>without limitation, restrictions on investing in issuers or
industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and </font><font>potentially greater price volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the
Russian market. There </font><font>can also be no assurance that an Underlying Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be expropriated, </font><font>nationalized or otherwise confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization </font><font>or other confiscation, an Underlying Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more costly to </font><font>obtain and enforce a judgment in the Russian court system.</font></div> <div><font>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic, political and social instability than is the case in other developed </font><font>countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military
</font><font>involvement in political and economic decision-making, including changes in government through extra-constitutional </font><font>means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal
</font><font>insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations, including armed conflict, with neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic, religious and racial </font><font>disaffection.</font></div> <div><font>The Russian economy is heavily dependent
upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, </font><font>forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity
prices and is particularly </font><font>vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or </font><font>internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia
</font><font>produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of </font><font>Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition,
</font><font>results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the </font><font>Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</font></div> <div><font>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control
</font><font>many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which </font><font>could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could
</font><font>adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its </font><font>regional geopolitical influence (including military steps) and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. </font><font>Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign
</font><font>governments. Such steps have increased tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may
</font><font>negatively affect economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity </font><font>may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the Russian issuers of securities in which an Underlying Fund </font><font>invests.
For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau </font><font>of Industry and Security’s </font><font>“</font><font>Entity List,</font><font>”</font><font> which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. </font><font>Actions like these may have
unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Russian economy.</font></div> <div><font>Russian invasion of
Ukraine</font><font>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </font><font>of the
military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </font><font>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are
impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </font><font>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and
threatened responses to such </font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy, Russian issuers of securities in which an Underlying Fund </font><font>invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact
</font><font>the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, </font><font>and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Russia Sanctions</font><font>. Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>Sanctioning Bodies</font><font>”</font><font>) have imposed </font><font>economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking entities,
</font><font>including banning Russia from global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies, or </font><font>others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result
</font><font>in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the </font><font>Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in
</font><font>prohibited assets, impairing the ability of an Underlying Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. </font><font>Recently, Russia has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability </font><font>companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, dividends), and
prohibits Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly
states</font><font>”</font><font> as well as the export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned
persons.</font></div> <div><font>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in
issuances of debt or equity </font><font>of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions has and may continue to impair the ability of an Underlying Fund to </font><font>buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or </font><font>unlawful for an Underlying Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively,
</font><font>“</font><font>affected </font><font>securities</font><font>”</font><font>), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, an Underlying Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in
</font><font>connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase an Underlying Fund’s </font><font>transaction costs. An Underlying Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</font></div> <div><font>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, which has impaired the value and liquidity
</font><font>of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by an Underlying Fund. </font><font>Due to such a freeze of these assets, including depositary receipts, an Underlying Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted
</font><font>assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in an </font><font>Underlying Fund receiving substantially lower prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures,
</font><font>which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of the Fund to receive dividend </font><font>payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by
</font><font>limited liability companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, dividends), and prohibits Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated </font><font>persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly states</font><font>”</font><font> as well as the export of raw materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned </font><font>persons. Russian companies may
be unable to pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund may be unable to receive </font><font>them.</font></div> <div><font>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident </font><font>investors
from executing security sales, and other events have led to changes in certain of the Underlying Indexes of the </font><font>Underlying Funds. The Underlying Fund’s Index Providers have
removed Russian securities where present in an Underlying </font><font>Index of an Underlying Fund. To the extent that an Underlying Fund rebalances its portfolio and trades in non-Russian
</font><font>securities to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index, this may result in transaction costs and increased </font><font>tracking error. The Underlying Funds are currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including those in their
</font><font>portfolios, while an Underlying Fund's Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. For Underlying Funds with Russian </font><font>securities, this disparity will also lead to increased tracking error. The inability of an Underlying Fund to trade in Russian
</font><font>securities may adversely affect an Underlying Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, </font><font>sanctions may be lifted or an Underlying Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will resume.</font></div> <div><font>Also, if an affected security is included in an Underlying Fund’s Underlying Index, an Underlying Fund may, where practicable, </font><font>seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to
</font><font>seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling </font><font>strategy may increase an Underlying Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of </font><font>the Underlying Index, an Underlying Fund may not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which
</font><font>may result in significant tracking error between an Underlying Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying </font><font>Index.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Saudi
Arabia. </font><font> </font><font> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Funds) to invest in the
securities of Saudi </font><font>Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and </font><font>unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market
</font><font>Authority (</font><font>“</font><font>CMA</font><font>”</font><font>) places investment limitations on the ownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign </font><font>investors, including a limitation on an Underlying Fund’s ownership of the securities of any single issuer listed on the Saudi </font><font>Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent an Underlying Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy.

<div> <div><font>restrictions may be changed or new restrictions,
such as licensing requirements, special approvals or additional foreign taxes, </font><font>may be instituted at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses or
approvals and may not be </font><font>able to buy and sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, </font><font>any of which could negatively impact an Underlying Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, compared to more developed </font><font>markets,
given the limited history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. Investments in Saudi Arabia may also be </font><font>subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of
assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on additional </font><font>foreign investments and repatriation of capital. Such heightened risks may include, among others, restrictions
on and </font><font>government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or </font><font>military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic
</font><font>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and </font><font>industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not </font><font>been
privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly </font><font>privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive
environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some </font><font>cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not
recur. Saudi </font><font>Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, </font><font>and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market for petroleum, as well as acts
</font><font>targeting petroleum production or processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi </font><font>Arabia may be significantly impacted. In the recent past, the Saudi Arabian government has explored privatization and
</font><font>diversification of the economy in the wake of a diminished petroleum market.</font></div> <div><font>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of
</font><font>the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: </font><font>restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is
</font><font>exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced </font><font>strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events.
</font><font>Incidents involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause uncertainty in their </font><font>markets and may adversely affect its economy and an Underlying Fund’s investments.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which could
affect </font><font>private sector companies and an Underlying Fund, as well as the value of securities in an Underlying Fund’s portfolio. Any </font><font>economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may
</font><font>result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse </font><font>consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian
</font><font>securities and/or funds investing in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of an Underlying Fund to buy, sell, receive or </font><font>deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes </font><font>in the availability of this labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</font></div> <div><font>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in
</font><font>Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, </font><font>illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control </font><font>and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than
</font><font>those of companies on exchanges in more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of </font><font>these securities and an Underlying Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced
political instability, </font><font>and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East region </font><font>could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government
</font><font>interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or </font><font>other factors. Additionally, anti-Western views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies
</font><font>regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries </font><font>may affect these attitudes and policies. The U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a </font><font>result, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S.
</font><font>imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </font><font>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result,
</font><font>securities to which an Underlying Fund has exposure. Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>caused significant disruptions to many industries.
Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect </font><font>the value of securities in an Underlying Fund’s portfolio.</font></div>
<div><font>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or
</font><font>embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as </font><font>state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which </font><font>operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. An Underlying Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject </font><font>to those risks.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in
Taiwan. </font><font> </font><font>Investment in Taiwanese issuers may subject a Fund or an Underlying Fund to
loss in the event </font><font>of adverse political, economic, regulatory and other developments that affect Taiwan, including fluctuations of the New </font><font>Taiwan dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Taiwan has few natural resources. Any fluctuation or shortage in the commodity markets
</font><font>could have a negative impact on the Taiwanese economy. Appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar, rising labor costs, and </font><font>increasing environmental consciousness have led some labor-intensive industries to relocate to other countries with cheaper
</font><font>work forces. Continued labor outsourcing may adversely affect the Taiwanese economy. Taiwanese firms are among the </font><font>world’s largest suppliers of computer monitors and leaders in personal computer manufacturing. A slowdown in global
</font><font>demand for these products will likely have an adverse impact on the Taiwanese economy. The Chinese government views </font><font>Taiwan as a renegade province and continues to contest Taiwan’s sovereignty. The outbreak of hostilities between the two
</font><font>nations, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, will likely adversely impact the Taiwanese economy. Such risks, </font><font>among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s</font><font> </font><font>or an Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </font><font>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in
</font><font>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless
</font><font>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </font><font>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds,
</font><font>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </font><font>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </font><font>products
and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting </font><font>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can
drastically affect a communication services </font><font>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </font><font>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer
</font><font>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </font></div>
<div><font>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The
costs of </font><font>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </font><font>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </font><font>world,
specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </font><font>communications services industry can also be significantly
affected by intense competition for market share, including </font><font>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization,
</font><font>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </font><font>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the
</font><font>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </font><font>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </font><font>innovations
may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</font></div> <div><font>Telecommunications providers
with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to </font><font>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the
telecommunications sector are limited, which may </font><font>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory
</font><font>oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </font><font>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be
</font><font>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </font><font>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </font></div>
<div><font>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including
competition, </font><font>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted
individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential </font><font>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete
quickly. </font><font>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </font><font>downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </font><font>less
revenue.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </font><font>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting,
</font><font>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </font><font>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel,
travel-related</font><font> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </font><font>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </font><font>household
income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </font><font>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when
economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </font><font>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </font><font>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </font><font>campaigns,
cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </font><font>import and export controls, intense competition, technological
developments and government regulation.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.
</font><font> </font><font>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </font><font>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production
</font><font>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </font><font>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government
</font><font>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </font><font>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the
</font><font>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </font><font>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a
</font><font>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </font><font>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions.
</font><font>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </font><font>their profitability.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of
Investing in the Energy Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by
the changes in and volatility </font><font>of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </font><font>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot
</font><font>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </font><font>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in an Underlying Fund's portfolio
</font><font>becomes distressed, an Underlying Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical </font><font>and is highly dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long
</font><font>periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting </font><font>Countries (</font><font>“</font><font>OPEC</font><font>”</font><font>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, </font><font>the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical
</font><font>conflicts, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected </font><font>by terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability </font><font>from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and </font><font>gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition
</font><font>to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </font><font>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes
</font><font>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </font><font>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate
(</font><font>e.g</font><font>., </font><font>expropriation,
nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </font><font>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence
or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </font><font>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of
governmental </font><font>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </font><font>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>their operations by governmental agencies. Such
regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. </font><font>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance
costs and may </font><font>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The energy sector may experience
significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </font><font>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy
and commodity futures markets due to </font><font>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. </font><font>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions
</font><font>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </font><font>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to
</font><font>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </font><font>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of an Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </font><font>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset
management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </font><font>companies
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer
finance firms, </font><font>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and
may affect their </font><font>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </font><font>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct
</font><font>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </font><font>the companies in which an Underlying Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government
</font><font>regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any </font><font>individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies
</font><font>has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including </font><font>interest rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures,
</font><font>including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and </font><font>general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include
</font><font>taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices </font><font>and restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and
</font><font>potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on </font><font>their businesses.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </font><font>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up,
</font><font>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </font><font>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </font><font>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic
</font><font>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>In addition, general economic
conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </font><font>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies.
Companies in the financials sector are </font><font>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </font><font>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the
</font><font>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </font><font>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </font><font>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</font><font>
risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </font><font>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse
cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </font><font>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
</font><font>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </font><font>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse
</font><font>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </font><font>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise
</font><font>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </font><font>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in
the future. These </font><font>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </font><font>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or
</font><font>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </font><font>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </font><font>companies
are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div><font>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </font><font>“</font><font>generic</font><font>”</font><font> products </font><font>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the
product to </font><font>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </font><font>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being
</font><font>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </font><font>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may
</font><font>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </font><font>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery
</font><font>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </font><font>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </font><font>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </font><font>a
material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </font><font>biotechnology or technological developments, and their
products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </font><font>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by
changes </font><font>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </font><font>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and
</font><font>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </font><font>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what
</font><font>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Additionally, the expansion of
facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </font><font>“</font><font>determinations of need</font><font>”</font><font> by certain </font><font>government authorities. This process
not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </font><font>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of
healthcare-related facilities </font><font>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </font><font>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </font><font>adversely
affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </font><font>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in
</font><font>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </font><font>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </font><font>affect
the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </font><font>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by
unpredictable factors.</font><font> </font><font>Aerospace and defense </font><font>companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because
</font><font>companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, </font><font>the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental
</font><font>defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation </font><font>stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, </font><font>labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant
</font><font>government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines </font><font>and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the
</font><font>sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product </font><font>liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the
Information Technology Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Information technology companies face intense
competition, both </font><font>domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, </font><font>information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products </font><font>of
information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent </font><font>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates
and competition for the services of qualified personnel. </font><font>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies,
</font><font>tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </font><font>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these </font><font>companies. Information technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject </font><font>to
adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, </font><font>certain companies in the information technology sector may be
particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </font><font>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.
</font><font>These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of </font><font>factors that could adversely affect their business
or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital </font><font>construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other
regulations, </font><font>the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, </font><font>the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely
</font><font>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological </font><font>developments, and labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure
</font><font>projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly </font><font>affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and
</font><font>other government demand for their products.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be adversely affected by government regulation or world events in
</font><font>the regions where the companies operate (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the </font><font>imposition of restrictions on foreign
investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor </font><font>unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage
in transactions involving, emerging </font><font>market countries, which may heighten these risks.</font></div> <div><font>Operations Risk. </font><font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its
assets appropriately </font><font>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic </font><font>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div> <div><font>Customer Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if
these customers </font><font>fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Regulatory Risk.
</font><font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and </font><font>also
may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </font><font>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes
in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div> <div><font>Strategic Asset Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, major pipelines or highways), </font><font>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic
characteristics. Given their national or </font><font>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors </font><font>and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div> <div><font>Interest Rate Risk. </font><font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure
companies, which could </font><font>negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div> <div><font>Leverage Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and
other risks normally </font><font>associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in </font><font>periods of rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div><font>Inflation Risk. </font><font>Many infrastructure
companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline </font><font>in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able
to charge users of its assets may be </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>37</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>linked to inflation, whether by government
regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the </font><font>rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div>
<div><font>Transportation Risk. </font><font>The stock
prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and </font><font>demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic
conditions may affect the </font><font>performance of companies in the transportation industry group.</font></div> <div><font>Oil and Gas Risk.</font><font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices,
exploration, and production </font><font>spending.</font></div> <div><font>Utilities Risk. </font><font>Utilities companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse </font><font>effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by </font><font>governmental regulatory commissions.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </font><font>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition,
</font><font>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </font><font>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure.
</font><font>Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. </font><font>Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor </font><font>investment
returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </font><font>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and
operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </font><font>“</font><font>Real </font><font>Estate Companies</font><font>”</font><font>). Investing in Real Estate
Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </font><font>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and
operated. The real estate </font><font>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </font><font>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific
</font><font>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div> <div><font>Concentration Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their
investments in a </font><font>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </font><font>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div><font>Distressed Investment Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank
loans. </font><font>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </font><font>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </font><font>bankruptcy.
Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </font><font>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to
financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </font><font>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div><font>Illiquidity Risk.</font><font> Investing in Real
Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</font><font> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of
small-capitalization companies, may be more </font><font>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </font><font>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price,
</font><font>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </font><font>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div><font>Interest Rate Risk.</font><font> Rising interest
rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </font><font>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations.
Declining interest rates could result in </font><font>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div><font>Leverage Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies
may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </font><font>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods
of rising interest rates. Real Estate </font><font>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </font><font>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </font><font>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>income to meet operating expenses, including,
where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </font><font>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate
Company to make </font><font>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div><font>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</font><font> Real Estate
Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </font><font>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its
market value. In addition to </font><font>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </font><font>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of
</font><font>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </font><font>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div> <div><font>Management Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial
resources. </font><font>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </font><font>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to
</font><font>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </font><font>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such
</font><font>properties may be limited.</font></div> <div><font>Property Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or
reduced desirability of </font><font>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </font><font>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be
</font><font>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </font><font>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div><font>Regulatory Risk.</font><font> Real estate income
and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </font><font>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes,
mandated closures or other </font><font>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </font><font>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain
</font><font>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </font><font>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div> <div><font>Underlying Investment Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity
instruments with </font><font>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </font><font>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated
</font><font>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </font><font>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </font><font>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a
</font><font>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </font><font>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated
</font><font>ranking. Investments in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in </font><font>senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior claims </font><font>to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary
</font><font>considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div> <div><font>U.S. Tax Risk.</font><font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A
REIT that fails to </font><font>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </font><font>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </font><font>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that
</font><font>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </font><font>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.
</font><font>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, an Underlying Fund may at </font><font>times need to request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the
</font><font>information otherwise provided to you.</font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </font><font>innovations and evolving industry standards,
and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </font><font>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often

<div> <div><font>experienced companies and may be subject to
greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </font><font>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets,
financial </font><font>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </font><font>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </font><font>unpredictable
changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </font><font>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the
technology sector because, in such an environment, those </font><font>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the
</font><font>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </font><font>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the
</font><font>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </font><font>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </font><font>may
be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </font><font>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector
may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </font><font>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
businesses.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </font><font>government regulation stipulating rates charged
by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </font><font>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also
subject to potential terrorist attacks, </font><font>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </font><font>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore
</font><font>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </font><font>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div> <div><font>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory
</font><font>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </font><font>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for
</font><font>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in an Underlying Funds' portfolio may own or </font><font>operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose
</font><font>additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in </font><font>climate conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the
</font><font>expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</font></div> <div><font>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and
</font><font>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </font><font>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt
</font><font>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </font><font>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </font><font>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to
</font><font>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </font><font>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand
</font><font>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Proxy Voting Policy</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the
Funds' Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies</font><font>”</font><font>) governing
</font><font>proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a
Fund </font><font>and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </font><font>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures
</font><font>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </font><font>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </font><font>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </font><font>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident
</font><font>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>The Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer or his

<div><font>Investment Policies</font></div> <div><font>The Board has adopted as fundamental policies the following numbered investment policies, which cannot be changed </font><font>without
the approval of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority </font><font>of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund is
defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting </font><font>securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting
securities of the Fund </font><font>are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund has also </font><font>adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental investment </font><font>policies
may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Therefore, each Fund may change its investment </font><font>objective without shareholder approval.</font></div>
<div><font>Fundamental Investment Policies of the Funds.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Funds may not:</font></div>
<div> <div> <div><font>1.</font></div>
<div><font>Purchase the securities of issuers conducting their principal business activity in the same
industry if, immediately after </font><font>the purchase and as a result thereof, the value of a Fund’s investments in that industry would equal or exceed 25% of </font><font>the current value of a Fund’s total assets, provided that this restriction does not limit a Fund’s: (i) investments in </font><font>securities of other investment companies, (ii) investments in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its
</font><font>agencies or instrumentalities, or (iii) investments in repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities.</font></div> </div>

<div><font>Purchase or hold real estate, except each Fund may purchase and hold securities or other
instruments that are secured </font><font>by, or linked to, real estate or interests therein, securities of real estate investment trusts, mortgage-related securities </font><font>and securities of issuers engaged in the real estate business, and each Fund may purchase and hold real estate as a </font><font>result
of the ownership of securities or other instruments.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>5.</font></div> <div><font>Underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the sale of portfolio securities by each Fund may be
</font><font>deemed to be an underwriting or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>6.</font></div>
<div><font>Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, except as permitted by the Investment
Company Act.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>7.</font></div> <div><font>Make loans to the
extent prohibited by the Investment Company Act.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>Notations Regarding each Fund’s Fundamental Investment Policies</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The following notations are not considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies
and are subject to </font><font>change without shareholder approval.</font></div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does </font><font>not
define what constitutes
</font><font>“</font><font>concentration</font><font>”</font><font> in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </font><font>more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </font><font>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration
could change in the future. The policy </font><font>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </font><font>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </font><font>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly,
</font><font>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </font><font>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the
</font><font>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </font><font>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund’s industry classifications, </font><font>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized
</font><font>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give </font><font>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </font><font>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for
any purpose, </font><font>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (Each Fund’s total </font><font>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires
</font><font>each Fund to maintain at all times an
</font><font>“</font><font>asset coverage</font><font>”</font><font> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </font><font>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total
assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </font><font>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is
known as </font><font>“</font><font>leveraging.</font><font>”</font><font> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </font><font>borrowings or
involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f- </font><font>4 under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse
repurchase agreements and similar financing </font><font>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </font><font>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and comply with Rule
18f-4 </font><font>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </font><font>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and
</font><font>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</font></div>
<div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does
not </font><font>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </font><font>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its
</font><font>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </font><font>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the
</font><font>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </font><font>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is
</font><font>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </font><font>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions
</font><font>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </font><font>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable
</font><font>law.</font></div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental
policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </font><font>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff
interpretations currently prohibit </font><font>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </font><font>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward
</font><font>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </font><font>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</font></div> <div><font>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies of the Funds.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies,
</font><font>except to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase </font><font>shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F)
</font><font>or (G) (the </font><font>“</font><font>fund of funds</font><font>”</font><font> provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each LifePath ETF has knowledge that its </font><font>shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section
</font><font>12(d)(1).</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund has adopted a
non-fundamental investment policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short </font><font>position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund’s Prospectus and Statement
of Additional Information, as amended </font><font>from time to time, and applicable law.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund’s fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies
apply </font><font>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund’s assets invested in certain </font><font>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not
</font><font>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </font><font>without undue market or tax consequences.</font></div>
<div><font>Notwithstanding any other investment policy or restriction (whether or not fundamental), the Underlying Funds in which
</font><font>each Fund may invest have adopted certain investment restrictions that may be different from those listed above, thereby </font><font>permitting each Fund to engage indirectly in investment strategies that are prohibited under the restrictions listed above. The </font><font>investment restrictions of each Underlying Fund are set forth in its respective statement of additional information.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Continuous Offering</font></div>
<div><font>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws.
</font><font>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </font><font>“</font><font>distribution,</font><font>”</font><font> as such term </font><font>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may,
</font><font>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </font><font>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</font></div>
<div><font>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after
placing </font><font>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </font><font>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand
</font><font>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </font><font>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </font><font>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as
</font><font>an underwriter.</font></div> <div><font>Broker-dealer firms
should also note that dealers who are not </font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> but are effecting transactions in shares,
</font><font>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </font><font>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </font><font>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are
</font><font>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </font><font>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the
</font><font>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </font><font>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</font></div> <div><font>Management</font></div> <div><font>Trustees and Officers.
</font><font> </font><font>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds,
including </font><font>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </font><font>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and
</font><font>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </font><font>“</font><font>interested persons</font><font>”</font><font> (as defined in the 1940
</font><font>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</font><font>“</font><font>Independent Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The registered investment companies
advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock-advised Funds</font><font>”</font><font>) are organized into one </font><font>complex of open-end
equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end
non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Fixed-Income</font><font> Complex</font><font>”</font><font>) and one complex of ETFs (</font><font>“</font><font>Exchange-Traded Fund Complex</font><font>”</font><font>) (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Fund Complex</font><font>”</font><font>). Each </font><font>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded

<div><font>Board – Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div><font>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a
</font><font>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </font><font>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </font><font>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </font><font>regular in
person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </font><font>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that
may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </font><font>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </font><font>providers to the Trust.</font></div> <div><font>The Board has appointed an
Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </font><font>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers,
officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </font><font>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The
</font><font>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </font><font>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </font><font>Committee to
assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </font><font>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups
to review and address the policies and practices of </font><font>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </font><font>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service
</font><font>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </font><font>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each
</font><font>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </font><font>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over
</font><font>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </font><font>enhance effective oversight.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on
</font><font>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </font><font>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk
</font><font>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </font><font>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </font><font>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s
</font><font>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </font><font>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </font><font>dedicated
Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</font><font>“</font><font>RQA</font><font>”</font><font>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </font><font>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their
</font><font>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </font><font>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent
</font><font>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </font><font>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's
</font><font>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </font><font>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief
</font><font>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </font><font>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public
</font><font>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </font><font>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </font><font>The
Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may
modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </font><font>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other
activities.</font></div> <div><font>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</font><font>  </font><font>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. </font><font>Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist </font><font>the

</font><font>Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the </font><font>Board's retirement policy; and (vi) recommending an appropriate level of compensation for the Independent Trustees for </font><font>their
services as Trustees, members or chairpersons of committees of the Board, Board Chair and any other positions as the </font><font>Nominating and Governance Committee considers appropriate. The
Nominating and Governance Committee does not </font><font>consider Board nominations recommended by shareholders (acting solely in their capacity as a shareholder and not in any </font><font>other capacity). The Nominating and Governance Committee met three times during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023.</font></div>

section as </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock</font><font>”</font><font>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </font><font>and/or other accounts managed by
BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </font><font>described below.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock is one of the world's
largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </font><font>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may
be involved in the investment </font><font>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</font><font> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are
</font><font>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
</font><font>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </font><font>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or
</font><font>sold by a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock has proprietary
interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </font><font>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment
objectives similar to those of a Fund </font><font>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also </font><font>a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed-income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients
</font><font>and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same </font><font>securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the </font><font>securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </font><font>performance.
Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </font><font>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that
may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </font><font>the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same
assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </font><font>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be
equitable. In </font><font>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </font><font>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </font><font>otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </font><font>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid
strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </font><font>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to
support </font><font>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </font><font>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </font><font>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or
</font><font>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </font><font>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to
</font><font>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </font><font>so.</font></div> <div><font>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio
decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </font><font>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the
price of the same security </font><font>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </font><font>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </font><font>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in
</font><font>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </font><font>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased
</font><font>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</font></div> <div><font>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or
</font><font>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>cross trades</font><font>”</font><font>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </font><font>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </font><font>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </font><font>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such
</font><font>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </font><font>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock and
its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </font><font>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices,
availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </font><font>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or
</font><font>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</font></div> <div><font>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </font><font>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises.
</font><font>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </font><font>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </font><font>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock
</font><font>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment
</font><font>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </font><font>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result,
</font><font>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </font><font>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached.
</font><font>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </font><font>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon
</font><font>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</font></div> <div><font>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary
</font><font>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis
and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </font><font>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or
strategies used for other </font><font>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </font><font>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of
</font><font>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </font><font>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the
</font><font>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </font><font>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </font><font>may
be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </font><font>and by its advisory clients.</font></div>
<div><font>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees
of other </font><font>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </font><font>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a
</font><font>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which
</font><font>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </font><font>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </font><font>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions.
</font><font>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may also create, write or
issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </font><font>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which
BlackRock has a significant minority </font><font>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </font><font>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially
</font><font>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income
</font><font>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </font><font>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the
</font><font>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </font><font>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative
</font><font>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </font><font>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative
</font><font>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </font><font>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity
</font><font>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div> <div><font>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by
</font><font>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </font><font>adverse to those of the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>At times, these
activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </font><font>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the
extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </font><font>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</font></div>
<div><font>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </font><font>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or
</font><font>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </font><font>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and
</font><font>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </font><font>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its
personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </font><font>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent,
lender, adviser or in other </font><font>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </font><font>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other
</font><font>amounts.</font></div> <div><font>When BlackRock acts as broker,
dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </font><font>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the
Funds. A Fund will be required to </font><font>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </font><font>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it
</font><font>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</font></div>
<div><font>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of
securities </font><font>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </font><font>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program,
</font><font>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </font><font>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for
</font><font>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </font><font>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by
</font><font>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </font><font>pro rata </font><font>allocation. </font></div> <div><font>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a
</font><font>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </font><font>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</font><font>“</font><font>shortfall risk</font><font>”</font><font>) in the securities lending
program. BlackRock establishes </font><font>program-wide borrower limits (</font><font>“</font><font>credit limits</font><font>”</font><font>) to actively manage
borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </font><font>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type
and </font><font>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </font><font>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of
</font><font>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </font><font>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans
</font><font>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation over time. In order to allocate </font><font>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending
capacity pursuant to the various program limits </font><font>(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a
</font><font>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </font><font>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to
</font><font>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </font><font>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for
</font><font>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </font><font>the firm.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may decline to make a securities
loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </font><font>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory
requirements and/or market rules, </font><font>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </font><font>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </font><font>loans overall.</font></div> <div><font>Purchases and sales of securities and
other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </font><font>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the
fact that they have different </font><font>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </font><font>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or
</font><font>required, or in cases involving client direction.</font></div> <div><font>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of
</font><font>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </font><font>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>the Funds. In addition, under certain
circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </font><font>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</font></div>
<div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts
or </font><font>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </font><font>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to
</font><font>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </font><font>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy
</font><font>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </font><font>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock
</font><font>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </font><font>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other
</font><font>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </font><font>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions
</font><font>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </font><font>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that
</font><font>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </font><font>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars,
although </font><font>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </font><font>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to
</font><font>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </font><font>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by
</font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </font><font>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services
</font><font>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </font><font>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also
</font><font>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </font><font>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides
</font><font>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same
</font><font>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</font><font>“</font><font>ECNs</font><font>”</font><font>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in
which BlackRock </font><font>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</font><font> </font><font>securities transactions for
</font><font>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </font><font>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like
</font><font>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </font><font>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the
</font><font>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client
</font><font>transactions.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock owns a minority
interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>MEMX</font><font>”</font><font>), a newly created U.S. stock </font><font>exchange.
Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </font><font>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such
Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </font><font>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting
</font><font>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </font><font>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and
</font><font>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </font><font>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in
</font><font>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </font><font>Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy</font><font>

<div> <div><font>It is also possible that, from time to time,
BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </font><font>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund.
Increasing a Fund’s </font><font>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </font><font>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the
</font><font>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </font><font>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by
</font><font>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </font><font>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </font><font>listing requirements for the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>It is possible that
a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </font><font>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also
invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </font><font>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </font><font>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</font><font> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the
</font><font>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </font><font>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock, its personnel and other
financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </font><font>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services
to and sales of the Funds or </font><font>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </font><font>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of
</font><font>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </font><font>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other
</font><font>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </font><font>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or
</font><font>products.</font></div> <div><font>Third parties, including
service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </font><font>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs
and conferences) for registered </font><font>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </font><font>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </font><font>provide services to a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may provide
valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </font><font>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from
the valuations for the same securities or </font><font>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </font><font>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information
</font><font>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </font><font>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such
</font><font>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</font></div> <div><font>As disclosed in more detail in the </font><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font><font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </font><font>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each
Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </font><font>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and
acts through </font><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </font><font>“</font><font>2a-5 Committee</font><font>”</font><font>), with assistance from other BFA
pricing committees and in accordance </font><font>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </font><font>“</font><font>Valuation Procedures</font><font>”</font><font>). When determining a
</font><font>“</font><font>fair value price,</font><font>”</font><font> the 2a-5 Committee </font><font>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in </font><font>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </font><font>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value
</font><font>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </font><font>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a
</font><font>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </font><font>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </font><font>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </font><font>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>interest of existing shareholders and may affect
the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </font><font>receives an asset-based fee.</font></div>
<div><font>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money
</font><font>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </font><font>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</font><font> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts
</font><font>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </font><font>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different
</font><font>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </font><font>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with
</font><font>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </font><font>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available
</font><font>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </font><font>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by
</font><font>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock
will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </font><font>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the
1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </font><font>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to
</font><font>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </font><font>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or
</font><font>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </font><font>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or
</font><font>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </font><font>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </font><font>BlackRock
may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </font><font>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies
for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </font><font>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services
for a </font><font>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </font><font>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, in connection
with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </font><font>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes
to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </font><font>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of
appropriate </font><font>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </font><font>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the
</font><font>issuer.</font></div> <div><font>The investment activities of
BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </font><font>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the
Funds invest in securities issued by </font><font>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </font><font>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </font><font>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds)
</font><font>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </font><font>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</font></div> <div><font>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of
</font><font>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </font><font>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As
</font><font>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </font><font>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </font><font>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
</font><font>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds
or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </font><font>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark
weight and </font><font>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </font><font>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable
</font><font>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </font><font>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the
</font><font>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </font><font>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be
</font><font>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </font><font>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</font></div> <div><font>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory
</font><font>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </font><font>to such security or asset.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may not serve as
an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</font></div> <div><font>Under an ETF Services Agreement,
certain Funds have retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </font><font>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the
issuance and redemption of Creation </font><font>Units of the Funds (</font><font>“</font><font>ETF Services</font><font>”</font><font>). BRIL will retain a portion of the
standard transaction fee received from Authorized </font><font>Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </font><font>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>Citibank</font><font>”</font><font>) on the design and development of the
ETF Services </font><font>platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by </font><font>BFA and its affiliates.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock may maintain
securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </font><font>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek
to track the performance of securities indices </font><font>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </font><font>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the
</font><font>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </font><font>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that
</font><font>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </font><font>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</font></div> <div><font>The custody arrangement described in </font><font>“</font><font>Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</font><font>”</font><font> may lead to potential </font><font>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses
</font><font>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </font><font>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </font><font>balances
uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </font><font>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that
BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </font><font>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions
</font><font>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </font><font>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or
</font><font>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, custodians, </font><font>administrators and
index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </font><font>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock
may also enter into contractual arrangements with </font><font>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated
</font><font>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </font><font>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to
</font><font>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock owns or has an ownership
interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </font><font>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service
provider in connection with the </font><font>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </font><font>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </font><font>profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock’s receipt of fees
from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </font><font>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an
arrangement with the service provider.</font></div> <div><font>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with
BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </font><font>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s
investment in </font><font>a Fund.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those
described </font><font>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</font></div> <div><font>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </font><font>Distribution Services</font></div>
<div><font>Investment Adviser.
</font><font> </font><font>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between </font><font>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </font><font>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory
</font><font>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </font><font>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and
</font><font>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted
</font><font>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </font><font>advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions
</font><font>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may </font><font>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time
</font><font>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</font></div>
<div><font>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the
cost </font><font>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </font><font>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of
</font><font>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </font><font>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</font></div>
<div><font>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund Operating
</font><font>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be
</font><font>eliminated by BFA at any time.</font></div> <div><font>For its
investment advisory services to each Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund based on a percentage of </font><font>each Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of
0.00%.</font></div> <div><font>The investment advisory agreement with respect to each Fund continues in effect for two years from its
effective date, and </font><font>thereafter is subject to annual approval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as </font><font>defined in the 1940 Act) of the applicable Fund, provided that in either event such continuance also is approved by a majority
</font><font>of the Board members who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the applicable Fund, by a vote cast in </font><font>person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.</font></div> <div><font>The investment advisory agreement with respect to each Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60 days’ notice, by the Board </font><font>or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act). </font><font>The investment advisory agreement is also terminable upon 60 days’ notice by BFA and will terminate automatically in the
</font><font>event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</font><font> </font></div> </div>

</font><font>those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to </font><font>time each Fund may receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than they would have if the Portfolio Managers
</font><font>and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</font></div> <div><font>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
</font><font>portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or </font><font>more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in
</font><font>addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA </font><font>or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio’s or account’s gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than </font><font>would otherwise be the case if BFA or any of its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets.

<div><font>Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview</font></div>
<div><font>The discussion below describes the Portfolio Managers' compensation as of October 4, 2023.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path
</font><font>emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of </font><font>components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation </font><font>include a
base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more </font><font>of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock,
Inc.</font></div> <div><font>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as
retirement and other </font><font>benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive </font><font>compensation, determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of </font><font>the
portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the </font><font>team relative to the portfolios’ investment
objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its </font><font>Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall
performance of these portfolios and </font><font>BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion </font><font>represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be
</font><font>granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term </font><font>shareholders and motivate performance.</font></div> <div><font>As of October
4, 2023, the Portfolio Managers did not beneficially own shares of the Funds.</font></div> <div><font>Codes of
Ethics. </font><font> </font><font>The Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to
Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. </font><font>The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, </font><font>including securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at
</font><font>the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's </font><font>Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at
</font><font>publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div>
<div><font>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. </font><font> </font><font>The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the </font><font>“</font><font>Patriot Act</font><font>”</font><font>). The Patriot Act is </font><font>intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism
or other illicit activities. </font><font>Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to </font><font>form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information will be used to verify </font><font>the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for
</font><font>compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow
</font><font>the Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose </font><font>identity it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the Funds' policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any </font><font>investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities.</font></div> <div><font>Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.</font><font>  </font><font>Citibank serves as administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Funds </font><font>under the Master Services Agreement (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Master Services
Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>). Citibank’s principal address is 388 Greenwich </font><font>Street, New York, NY 10013. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement with the Trust, Citibank provides necessary
</font><font>administrative, tax and accounting and financial reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each </font><font>Fund. In addition, Citibank makes available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to provide such
</font><font>services. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement with the Trust, Citibank maintains, in separate accounts, cash, securities </font><font>and other assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and records and provides other services.

<div> <div><font>is required, upon the order of the Trust, to
deliver securities held by Citibank and to make payments for securities purchased </font><font>by the Trust for each Fund. Citibank is authorized to appoint certain foreign custodians or
foreign custody managers for Fund </font><font>investments outside the U.S. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement with the Trust, Citibank acts as a transfer agent for </font><font>each Fund’s authorized and issued shares of beneficial interest, and as dividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As
</font><font>compensation for these services, Citibank receives certain out-of-pocket costs, transaction fees and asset-based fees which </font><font>are accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from its management fee.</font></div> <div><font>JPMorgan serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities under a Custody Services
</font><font>Agreement. JPMorgan’s principal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11</font><font>th</font><font> Floor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the Custody </font><font>Services Agreement with BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan provides custody and
related services required to facilitate securities </font><font>lending by the Fund. JPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund securities lending activity in </font><font>coordination with other funds, maintains custodial records and provides other services. As compensation for these services,
</font><font>JPMorgan receives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC from its compensation for its services as securities lending agent.</font></div>
<div><font>Distributor.
</font><font> </font><font>The Distributor's principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are
continuously offered for </font><font>sale by the Funds through the Distributor or its agent only in Creation Units, as described in the applicable Prospectus and </font><font>below in the</font><font> </font><font>Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of </font><font>Creation Units</font><font> </font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units </font><font>are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the </font><font>applicable Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both
</font><font>orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer</font><font> registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>1934 Act</font><font>”</font><font>), and a member of the Financial </font><font>Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(</font><font>“</font><font>FINRA</font><font>”</font><font>). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S. states, as well as </font><font>in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div> <div><font>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may be
terminated at any time, without the payment of any </font><font>penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent
</font><font>Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. </font><font>The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</font></div>
<div><font>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities dealers (</font><font>“</font><font>Soliciting Dealers</font><font>”</font><font>) who will solicit purchases of </font><font>Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants
(as described below), DTC </font><font>participants and/or investor services organizations.</font></div> <div><font>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution,
</font><font>including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</font></div>
<div><font>Securities Lending.
</font><font> </font><font>To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its
securities lending </font><font>pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of </font><font>BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Securities Lending Agency
Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund and Underlying Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as
</font><font>compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income </font><font>earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or
</font><font>other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly </font><font>related to securities lending, including custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each Fund and Underlying Fund are responsible for fees

Affiliates.</font><font>  </font><font>BFA and/or its affiliates (</font><font>“</font><font>BFA Entities</font><font>”</font><font>) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered </font><font>investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries (</font><font>“</font><font>Intermediaries</font><font>”</font><font>) for certain activities related to the Funds, </font><font>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make
these payments from their own assets and </font><font>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </font><font>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds (including, if applicable, any underlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-traded</font><font> products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of </font><font>owning,
the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ </font><font>participation in activities that are designed to make registered
representatives, other professionals and individual investors </font><font>more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other
activities, </font><font>such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development </font><font>of technology platforms and reporting systems
(</font><font>“</font><font>Education Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for </font><font>certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials
relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded </font><font>products (</font><font>“</font><font>Publishing Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). In addition, BFA Entities
make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, </font><font>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced
commission </font><font>rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares </font><font>funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other
</font><font>iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own </font><font>assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may
</font><font>benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </font><font>Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</font></div> <div><font>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </font><font>salesperson
or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </font><font>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its </font><font>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on
</font><font>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </font><font>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded</font><font> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </font><font>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </font><font>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</font></div> <div><font>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related
</font><font>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </font><font>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its
</font><font>customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and
</font><font>BlackRock mutual funds.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education
</font><font>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>FBS</font><font>”</font><font>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </font><font>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>NFS</font><font>”</font><font>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this
special, </font><font>long-term and significant arrangement (the </font><font>“</font><font>Marketing Program</font><font>”</font><font>), FBS, NFS and certain of

<div> <div><font>“</font><font>Fidelity</font><font>”</font><font>) have agreed, among other things, to
actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </font><font>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer
certain iShares funds in </font><font>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </font><font>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other
</font><font>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment
</font><font>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </font><font>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS
</font><font>and NFS during the wind-down period.</font></div> <div><font>In
addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </font><font>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares
business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </font><font>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision,
technology </font><font>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </font><font>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In
</font><font>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </font><font>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described
</font><font>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </font><font>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG,
</font><font>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset
</font><font>Management, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan </font><font>Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public
</font><font>Holdings, Inc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, Stash Investments, LLC, TD </font><font>Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network,
</font><font>LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since </font><font>the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</font></div>
<div><font>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the
</font><font>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </font><font>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an
</font><font>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </font><font>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </font><font>combination of
the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </font><font>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in
general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </font><font>the next year. </font><font>Please contact
your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </font><font>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may
receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </font><font>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage
customers to </font><font>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</font></div>
<div><font>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an
affiliate </font><font>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </font><font>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then
</font><font>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </font><font>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee
</font><font>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </font><font>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</font></div> <div><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font></div>
<div><font>Valuation of Shares. </font><font>The NAV for each
Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </font><font>Stock Exchange
(</font><font>“</font><font>NYSE</font><font>”</font><font>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </font><font>by a Fund is as
follows:</font></div> <div><font>Equity Investments. </font><font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </font><font>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous
transaction pricing information (each an </font><font>“</font><font>Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an

<div> <div><font>Exchange closing price is not available, the last
traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </font><font>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market
value may be used. If </font><font>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </font><font>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a
</font><font>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </font><font>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Options, Futures,
Swaps and Other Derivatives. </font><font>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </font><font>which market
quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </font><font>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the
event that there is no mean price available for an </font><font>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or
</font><font>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </font><font>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </font><font>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </font><font>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </font><font>may
incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </font><font>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as
of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </font><font>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with
</font><font>the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div><font>Underlying Funds. </font><font>Shares of
underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </font><font>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent
closing price.</font></div> <div><font>General Valuation Information. </font><font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </font><font>makers to value a Fund’s
securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </font><font>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation
is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </font><font>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </font><font>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div> <div><font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </font><font>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </font><font>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be
</font><font>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </font><font>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </font><font>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> <div><font>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</font></div> <div><font>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not
</font><font>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </font><font>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and
</font><font>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </font><font>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and
</font><font>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</font></div>
<div><font>Fair Value.</font><font> When market quotations
are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </font><font>valued at fair value (</font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Assets</font><font>”</font><font>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </font><font>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the
Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </font><font>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably
conclude that a market </font><font>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </font><font>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is
</font><font>unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where
it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </font><font>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or
where the security or other asset or liability is only </font><font>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this
</font><font>purpose, a </font><font>“</font><font>significant event</font><font>”</font><font> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </font><font>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </font><font>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is
open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </font><font>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s
price, provided that BFA is not aware of </font><font>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </font><font>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant
</font><font>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </font><font>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and
</font><font>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </font><font>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect
</font><font>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </font><font>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an
</font><font>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </font><font>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined
</font><font>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</font></div> <div><font>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an
</font><font>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </font><font>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </font><font>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical
</font><font>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </font><font>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an
</font><font>investment.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </font><font>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </font><font>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </font><font>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
</font><font>accepted in the United States of America (</font><font>“</font><font>US GAAP</font><font>”</font><font>), follow the requirements for valuation
set forth in Financial </font><font>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>ASC 820</font><font>”</font><font>), which defines and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </font><font>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Generally, ASC 820 and other
accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </font><font>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing
the determination of the fair market </font><font>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </font><font>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </font><font>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</font></div>
<div><font>Brokerage Transactions</font></div> <div><font>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </font><font>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to
</font><font>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </font><font>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </font><font>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily
</font><font>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily
</font><font>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </font><font>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In
</font><font>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA
</font><font>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services
provided.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute
portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </font><font>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature
and character of the security </font><font>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </font><font>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </font><font>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of
</font><font>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </font><font>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </font><font>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of
</font><font>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </font><font>other circumstances.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Section
28(e)</font><font>”</font><font>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </font><font>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another
</font><font>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </font><font>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities
</font><font>under certain conditions.</font></div> <div><font>From time to
time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </font><font>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling
securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </font><font>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will
</font><font>provide research </font><font>“</font><font>credits</font><font>”</font><font> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </font><font>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</font></div> <div><font>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on
</font><font>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of </font><font>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </font><font>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S.,
</font><font>will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</font></div> <div><font>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally
</font><font>traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </font><font>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or
</font><font>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </font><font>will generally include a </font><font>“</font><font>spread,</font><font>”</font><font> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </font><font>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</font></div> <div><font>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited
</font><font>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </font><font>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers
</font><font>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </font><font>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any
</font><font>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </font><font>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940
</font><font>Act.</font></div> <div><font>Purchases of money market
instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </font><font>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because
money market instruments are </font><font>generally traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis with dealers acting as principal for
their own accounts without a stated commission. The </font><font>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BFA may, from time to time, effect
trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </font><font>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and
regulations. Under these provisions, </font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings
include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </font><font>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly
from or to an issuer, no </font><font>commissions or discounts are paid.</font></div> <div><font>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made
</font><font>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </font><font>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </font><font>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration
</font><font>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </font><font>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an
</font><font>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </font><font>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations:
</font><font>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </font><font>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or
</font><font>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </font><font>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client
</font><font>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </font><font>in which the Funds may invest.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Initial public offerings (</font><font>“</font><font>IPOs</font><font>”</font><font>) of securities may be over-subscribed and
subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </font><font>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </font><font>“</font><font>new</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>hot</font><font>”</font><font> issue, the supply of securities </font><font>available for
client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </font><font>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts
over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </font><font>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering
with respect </font><font>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </font><font>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market
</font><font>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </font><font>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally,
</font><font>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> basis. This
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if
pro-rating had not </font><font>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </font><font>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the
</font><font>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </font><font>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are
</font><font>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</font></div> <div><font>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities
</font><font>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </font><font>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same
</font><font>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </font><font>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold,
</font><font>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </font><font>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If
</font><font>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </font><font>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made,
</font><font>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</font></div> <div><font>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or
</font><font>“</font><font>bunch</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of
affiliates. In general, all </font><font>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </font><font>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a
</font><font>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </font><font>pro </font><font>rata</font><font> among the
clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </font><font>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all
accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </font><font>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases
this practice </font><font>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions
effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </font><font>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of
securities being sold, </font><font>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </font><font>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a
</font><font>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </font><font>order.</font></div> <div><font>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for
securities may be combined with those of other investment companies, clients or </font><font>accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the
Funds and one or more other </font><font>accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are </font><font>allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this
</font><font>procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, </font><font>in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will </font><font>be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the
</font><font>Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers </font><font>or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by
</font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless </font><font>permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</font></div> <div><font>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater </font><font>brokerage expenses. Because each Fund is newly launched, there is no reportable portfolio turnover.</font></div> <div><font>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</font></div> <div><font>Shares.</font><font>  </font><font>The
Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional </font><font>iShares funds.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each share issued by a fund has a
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, </font><font>subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and
</font><font>distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on </font><font>liquidation.</font></div> <div><font>Each share has one vote with respect to
matters upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to </font><font>shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all
affected funds will vote </font><font>together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than </font><font>one fund.</font></div> <div><font>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not
required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the </font><font>1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless
required to do so under the 1940 </font><font>Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under </font><font>Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of
</font><font>trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a </font><font>“</font><font>control person</font><font>”</font><font> of the fund, as defined in Rule
0-1 under the 1940 </font><font>Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Shareholders may make inquiries by
writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, </font><font>Princeton, NJ 08540.</font></div>
<div><font>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares
of a </font><font>fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In </font><font>addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial </font><font>owners of 10% of the shares of a fund
(</font><font>“</font><font>Insiders</font><font>”</font><font>) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale </font><font>provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and

<div> <div><font>consult with their own legal counsel concerning
their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing </font><font>guidance provided by the SEC staff.</font></div>
<div><font>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the </font><font>“</font><font>Declaration of Trust</font><font>”</font><font>), the Board may, </font><font>without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or
applicable law, </font><font>including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or </font></div>
<div><font>take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</font><font>  </font><font>The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the </font><font>Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on
</font><font>termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is </font><font>required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of
</font><font>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </font><font>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </font><font>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a
</font><font>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </font><font>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </font><font>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</font></div> <div><font>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </font><font>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on
behalf of, DTC.</font></div> <div><font>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of securities between its participants
(</font><font>“</font><font>DTC Participants</font><font>”</font><font>), and </font><font>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central
</font><font>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </font><font>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>DTCC</font><font>”</font><font>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </font><font>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them
</font><font>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </font><font>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC
</font><font>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</font><font>“</font><font>Indirect Participants</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
<div><font>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through
DTC </font><font>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </font><font>referred to herein as </font><font>“</font><font>Beneficial Owners</font><font>”</font><font>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </font><font>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
</font><font>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </font><font>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </font><font>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </font><font>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the
</font><font>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </font><font>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each
</font><font>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </font><font>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication,
</font><font>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
</font><font>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </font><font>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses
</font><font>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</font></div> <div><font>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </font><font>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </font><font>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its
</font><font>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </font><font>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </font><font>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </font><font>“</font><font>street name,</font><font>”</font><font> and will be the responsibility of
such DTC Participants.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or
</font><font>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</font><font>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </font><font>cost.</font></div> <div><font>Distribution of Shares. </font><font> </font><font>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </font><font>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized
</font><font>Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such </font><font>initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration
</font><font>statement for each Fund (each, a
</font><font>“</font><font>Selling Shareholder</font><font>”</font><font>), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to </font><font>time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any
of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these </font><font>shares.</font></div> <div><font>Selling Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on
</font><font>any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in </font><font>the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the
</font><font>time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected through </font><font>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or
</font><font>through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size </font><font>by them through an Authorized Participant.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Any Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be
</font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of
the </font><font>1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</font></div> <div><font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font></div> <div><font>General.</font><font>  </font><font>The
Trust issues and sells shares of each Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor </font><font>or its agent, without a sales load, at a price based on a
Fund’s NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day (as </font><font>defined below), of an order received by the Distributor or its agent in proper form. On days when the
Listing Exchange or the </font><font>listing exchange for the Fund’s exchange-traded options close earlier than normal, the Funds may require orders to be placed </font><font>earlier in the day. The following table sets forth the number of shares of each Fund that constitute a Creation Unit for the

</font><font>Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Fund Deposit. </font><font> </font><font>The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund is generally cash. However, in some cases
the </font><font>consideration consists of a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (including any portion of such </font><font>securities for which cash may be substituted)
(</font><font>“</font><font>Deposit Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Basket</font><font>”</font><font>) and the Cash Component </font><font>computed as described
below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the </font><font>“</font><font>Fund Deposit,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>which will be applicable
(subject to possible amendment or correction) to creation requests received in proper form. The </font><font>Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a
Creation Unit of a Fund. Such Fund </font><font>Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund </font><font>until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Component</font><font>”</font><font> is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </font><font>“</font><font>Deposit Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </font><font>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and
</font><font>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </font><font>Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Each Fund’s current policy is to accept cash in substitution for the Deposit Securities it might otherwise accept as
in-kind </font><font>consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. A Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit Securities (i.e., the in-kind </font><font>deposit of a designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. If
</font><font>a Fund elects to accept Deposit Securities, a purchaser’s delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the Cash </font><font>Component will constitute the </font><font>“</font><font>Fund
Deposit,</font><font>”</font><font> which will represent the consideration for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Please </font><font>see the Cash Purchase Method section below and the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for </font><font>further
information on purchasing Creation Units of a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Deposit Securities, in connection with a purchase of a Creation Unit of a Fund, will consist of a pro rata basket of the
</font><font>Fund’s portfolio except for differences due to minimum trading sizes for bonds, minimum lot sizes or rounding.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The identity and number or par
value of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund’s </font><font>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected
from time to time by BFA with a view to </font><font>the investment objective(s) of a Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to </font><font>adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting a Fund’s
portfolio.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Fund
Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities </font><font>portion of the Fund Deposit through </font><font>“</font><font>systematic rounding.</font><font>”</font><font> The rounding methodology </font><font>“</font><font>rounds up</font><font>”</font><font> position sizes of </font><font>securities in the Deposit
Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum </font><font>allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the
Fund Deposit.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Trust
may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any </font><font>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </font><font>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when
</font><font>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </font><font>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an
</font><font>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </font><font>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other
situations.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Cash Purchase Method. </font><font> </font><font>When partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund
(Creation </font><font>Units of a Fund are generally offered solely for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind </font><font>purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of
</font><font>the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash
</font><font>Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units. </font><font> </font><font>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </font><font>a Fund, an entity must be: (i) a </font><font>“</font><font>Participating
Party,</font><font>”</font><font> i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through </font><font>the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </font><font>“</font><font>Clearing Process</font><font>”</font><font>), a clearing agency that is
registered with the </font><font>SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and </font><font>redemptions of Creation Units (</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized
Participant Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>) (discussed below). A member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with a Fund or one of its service providers that allows
</font><font>such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an
</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized
Participant.</font><font>”</font><font> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name
of Cede </font><font>&amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Role of the Authorized Participant. </font><font> </font><font>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with a Fund or one of its service providers that
</font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Such Authorized </font><font>Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor
</font><font>on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of </font><font>each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next
</font><font>determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An </font><font>Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such
</font><font>Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not </font><font>Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that
</font><font>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that </font><font>orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor’s broker through an Authorized Participant. As a
</font><font>result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust </font><font>does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list
</font><font>of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding </font><font>Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines </font><font>set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection </font><font>with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized
</font><font>Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Placement of Creation Orders. </font><font> </font><font>Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. </font><font>government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such
</font><font>as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by Citibank or a sub-custodian (a </font><font>“</font><font>Central Depository Account</font><font>”</font><font>). Any portion of the
</font><font>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central </font><font>Depository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely </font><font>fashion
so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of a Fund </font><font>generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.
Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve </font><font>System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite
</font><font>number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of a Fund generally </font><font>before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account </font><font>must
be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository </font><font>Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the
Settlement Date. The </font><font>“</font><font>Settlement
Date</font><font>”</font><font> for all funds is generally the
</font><font>second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the </font><font>validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the </font><font>Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred
</font><font>directly to Citibank through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by Citibank </font><font>generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not
</font><font>received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the </font><font>Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using the Fund Deposit as newly constituted </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>to reflect the then current NAV of a Fund. The
delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the </font><font>second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the
Distributor, provided that the </font><font>relevant Fund Deposit has been received by a Fund prior to such time.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Purchase Orders.
</font><font> </font><font>To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the
Distributor or its </font><font>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </font><font>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </font><font>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the
</font><font>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </font><font>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be
</font><font>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </font><font>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time
</font><font>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </font><font>such Business Day.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to a
</font><font>Fund, immediately available or same day funds estimated by a Fund to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next
</font><font>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </font><font>orders should ascertain the deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary
</font><font>institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff </font><font>Time of a Fund. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed
</font><font>with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including
any applicable cash </font><font>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders. </font><font> </font><font>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </font><font>of a Fund before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day’s NAV. Creation Orders must be
</font><font>transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by a Fund to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures </font><font>set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other
</font><font>communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. A Fund’s </font><font>deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as the Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>Cutoff Time.</font><font>”</font><font> The Distributor or </font><font>its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant
</font><font>at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the </font><font>facilities of the Distributor’s or its agent’s proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption </font><font>requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance
</font><font>with a Fund’s Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Acceptance of
Orders for Creation Units. </font><font> </font><font>Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase
order has been </font><font>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor’s behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </font><font>a Fund are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, a Fund will accept </font><font>the
order, subject to the Fund’s right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set </font><font>forth below.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Once a Fund has accepted an order,
upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </font><font>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent
will then transmit a </font><font>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each Fund reserves the right to
reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </font><font>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under
the Investment Company Act. For example, a </font><font>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form;
</font><font>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </font><font>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </font><font>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (e.g., jeopardize the Fund’s tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </font><font>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its
</font><font>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The
Funds, Citibank, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no </font><font>duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund
Deposits nor shall any of them incur </font><font>any liability for failure to give such notification.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Issuance of a Creation Unit. </font><font> </font><font>Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to a
</font><font>Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has </font><font>confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered
</font><font>to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such </font><font>delivery and a Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a
</font><font>“</font><font>T+2 basis</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(i.e., two Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit
transactions on a basis other </font><font>than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, as applicable. For example, a Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </font><font>transactions on a basis other than T+2 in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for different
</font><font>treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (i.e., the last day the holder of a </font><font>security can sell the security and still receive dividend (payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>To the extent contemplated by an
Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units </font><font>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund
Deposits have not been received in </font><font>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </font><font>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </font><font>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for
</font><font>a Fund. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </font><font>settlement date. Information concerning a Fund’s current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </font><font>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit a Fund to buy the missing
</font><font>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </font><font>Fund of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </font><font>and other charges.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these
</font><font>instances, each Fund reserves the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </font><font>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to
</font><font>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </font><font>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by such Fund and the Fund’s determination shall be final and binding.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Costs Associated
with Creation Transactions. </font><font> </font><font>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset
the transfer and </font><font>other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. Under an ETF Services Agreement, a Fund has </font><font>retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard </font><font>transaction fee on each creation order, which consists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF Services (the </font><font>“</font><font>ETF Servicing Fee</font><font>”</font><font>) </font><font>and (2) transfer, processing and other transaction costs charged by a Fund custodian in connection with the issuance of
</font><font>Creation Units for such creation order (</font><font>“</font><font>Custody Transaction Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). BRIL is entitled to
retain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant </font><font>to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to a Fund custodian according to the </font><font>amounts invoiced by such custodian.</font></div> <div><font>The ETF Servicing
Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, which amount will </font><font>vary among different BlackRock-advised funds based on a number of factors,
including the complexity of the order and the </font><font>types of securities or instruments included in a Fund’s Creation Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody </font><font>Transaction Costs vary per order based on the number of trades, underlying markets and settlement locations associated </font><font>with
the issuance of a Creation Unit. The following table sets forth a Fund’s standard creation transaction fee that would have </font><font>been charged as of October 4, 2023, although the
actual fee charged to an Authorized Participant in connection with a </font><font>creation order will vary depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than the fee set forth
below.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>If a purchase
consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the </font><font>maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,
execution, price movement and other costs and </font><font>expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a </font><font>good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit
</font><font>Securities to a Fund. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. </font><font>Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on a </font><font>Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units.
There can be no assurance, however, </font><font>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors </font><font>should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a
</font><font>Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary </font><font>market.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities (as defined below). Please see the following discussion
</font><font>summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the
Funds.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Each Fund
publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be </font><font>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests
received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</font><font>“</font><font>Fund </font><font>Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Redemption Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), and an amount of cash (the </font><font>“</font><font>Cash
Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> as described below) are applicable, in </font><font>order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of the Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until
</font><font>such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund
</font><font>Securities and Cash Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Procedures and requirements governing
</font><font>redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Unless cash redemptions are
available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </font><font>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the
difference between the net asset value of the </font><font>shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund </font><font>Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
</font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </font><font>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the
Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </font><font>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a
trading </font><font>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </font><font>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </font><font>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot
</font><font>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </font><font>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </font><font>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the
</font><font>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The Funds generally </font><font>redeem Creation Units for Fund Securities, but the Funds reserve the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation
</font><font>Units. A Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs </font></div> </div> <div>

but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified </font><font>to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption
Basket through </font><font>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </font><font>“</font><font>rounded </font><font>up,</font><font>”</font><font> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the
</font><font>Redemption Basket.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Cash Redemption Method. </font><font> </font><font>Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units
</font><font>of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected </font><font>in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized
</font><font>Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus </font><font>the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions. </font><font> </font><font>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and </font><font>other transaction costs that may be incurred by a Fund. As described above, under an ETF Services Agreement, a Fund has
</font><font>retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard </font><font>transaction fee on each redemption order, which consists of (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody Transaction Costs.
</font><font>BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody </font><font>Transaction Costs to a Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian.</font></div> <div><font>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, which amount will
</font><font>vary among different BlackRock-advised funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the </font><font>types of securities or instruments included in a Fund’s Redemption Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody
</font><font>Transaction Costs vary per order based on the number of trades, underlying markets, and settlement locations associated </font><font>with the redemption of a Creation Unit. The following table sets forth a Fund’s standard redemption transaction fee that
</font><font>would have been charged as of October 4, 2023, although the actual fee charged to an Authorized Participant in connection </font><font>with a redemption order will vary depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than the fee set forth below.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>If a redemption consists solely or
partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the </font><font>maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price
movement and other costs and </font><font>expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a </font><font>good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities </font><font>from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in
</font><font>certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares </font><font>may be charged a fee for such services.</font><font> </font></div>

<div> <div><font>Placement of Redemption Orders.
</font><font> </font><font>Redemption requests for Creation Units of a Fund must be submitted to the Distributor
</font><font>or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable request to redeem </font><font>shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day, in order to receive that day’s NAV. On days </font><font>when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed
</font><font>earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption </font><font>request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized
</font><font>Participants upon request.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by a Fund to the Distributor or
its </font><font>agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their </font><font>particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </font><font>Creation
Units may have to be placed by the investor’s broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </font><font>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited
number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </font><font>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form
specified </font><font>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </font><font>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to a Fund’s transfer agent; such </font><font>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or
</font><font>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>A redemption request is considered to be in </font><font>“</font><font>proper form</font><font>”</font><font> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </font><font>transferred to a Fund’s transfer agent the Creation
Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective </font><font>by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii)
a request in </font><font>form satisfactory to a Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or </font><font>another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized
</font><font>Participant Agreement are properly followed.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify a Fund and the Fund’s transfer agent
of such </font><font>redemption request. The tender of an investor’s shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash </font><font>included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant
</font><font>Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant </font><font>through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant
</font><font>submitting the redemption request.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain
</font><font>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </font><font>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Deliveries of redemption proceeds
by the Funds are generally made within two Business Days (i.e., </font><font>“</font><font>T+2</font><font>”</font><font>). However, each </font><font>Fund reserves the right to
settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if </font><font>necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable
law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a </font><font>number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled </font><font>market closings, an effort to link distribution to dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays.</font></div> <div><font>If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the </font><font>extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of
</font><font>the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, the Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than </font><font>seven days if the Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>If neither the Authorized
Participant nor the Beneficial Owner on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting has </font><font>appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable
non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to </font><font>make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in
</font><font>its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its </font><font>redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares
</font><font>based on the NAV of a Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption </font><font>transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset a Fund’s brokerage and other transaction costs associated </font><font>with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with
</font><font>applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and a Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the
extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon </font><font>redemptions or cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>To the extent contemplated by an
Authorized Participant’s agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </font><font>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable
to transfer all or part of the Creation </font><font>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by the Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the </font><font>date of submission of redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the
</font><font>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </font><font>secured by the Authorized Participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </font><font>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </font><font>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by Citibank and marked-to-market daily. The fees
</font><font>of Citibank and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by </font><font>the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits a Fund to acquire shares of the Fund at any time
</font><font>and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Fund of </font><font>purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related
</font><font>brokerage and other charges.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to the Funds: (i) for any period
</font><font>during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during </font><font>which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a
</font><font>result of which disposal of the shares of a Fund’s portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably </font><font>practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Custom Baskets.
</font><font> </font><font>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and the Funds will accept </font><font>“</font><font>custom baskets.</font><font>”</font><font> A custom basket </font><font>may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a
Fund’s portfolio </font><font>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </font><font>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </font><font>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of
</font><font>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom
</font><font>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </font><font>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for
</font><font>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </font><font>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </font><font>be
used for a Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </font><font>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an
Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </font><font>process to oversee basket compliance for a Fund, as set forth in each Fund’s policies and procedures.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Taxation on
Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. </font><font> </font><font>An Authorized Participant generally will
recognize either gain or </font><font>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </font><font>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </font><font>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities
</font><font>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Current U.S. federal income tax
laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </font><font>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the
Creation Units for more than one year, </font><font>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </font><font>assets.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Taxes</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and
</font><font>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </font><font>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current
</font><font>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local </font><font>and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund.

<div><font>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC </font><font>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at
</font><font>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </font><font>and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s
</font><font>annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </font><font>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from
</font><font>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </font><font>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an </font><font>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships
that derive at least 90% of their </font><font>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </font><font>quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </font><font>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities
</font><font>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </font><font>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </font><font>value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of </font><font>other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that
</font><font>are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more </font><font>qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div> <div><font>A Fund may be
able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </font><font>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a
tax</font><font> </font><font>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </font><font>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an
</font><font>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </font><font>income.</font></div> <div><font>Although, in general, the passive loss rules
of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </font><font>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's
investments in partnerships, </font><font>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, </font><font>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation of RICs. </font><font> </font><font>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </font><font>income and capital
gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </font><font>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must
distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </font><font>“</font><font>investment company taxable
income</font><font>”</font><font>
(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized
</font><font>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </font><font>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </font><font>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to
</font><font>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </font><font>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </font><font>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </font><font>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital
</font><font>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </font><font>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </font><font>or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </font><font>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the </font><font>Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets
(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the aggregate </font><font>gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund
</font><font>had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div> <div><font>Excise Tax.</font><font>  </font><font>A
Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for
the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </font><font>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital

<div> <div><font>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject
to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </font><font>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will
be increased or </font><font>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </font><font>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of
</font><font>this 4% excise tax. Long-term capital distributions from the Underlying Funds paid in December or, in certain cases, January </font><font>in satisfaction of this rule will be subject to potential distribution by the Funds in the following calendar year.</font></div> <div><font>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </font><font> </font><font>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </font><font>succeeding year, until they
have been reduced to zero.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss
</font><font>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to
limitation.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.</font><font>  </font><font> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </font><font>Code as received by the
shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or distribution </font><font>declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and
payable to shareholders of record on a </font><font>specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar </font><font>year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund
</font><font>during January of the following calendar year.</font></div> <div><font>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income and
</font><font>any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss </font><font>carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in </font><font>excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat </font><font>rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital
</font><font>gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as </font><font>long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their
</font><font>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </font><font>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </font><font>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over
</font><font>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be </font><font>entitled to a refund of their </font><font>pro
rata</font><font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </font><font>with the
IRS.</font></div> <div><font>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains
dividends are taxable as long-term</font><font> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </font><font>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings
</font><font>and profits (</font><font>“</font><font>regular
dividends</font><font>”</font><font>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified
</font><font>dividend income below. Because the Fund is expected to invest in an Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of </font><font>shares of an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as </font><font>“</font><font>wash sales.</font><font>”</font><font> Distributions of short-term capital
</font><font>gains by an Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital </font><font>loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the </font><font>Fund. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders,
</font><font>depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</font></div> <div><font>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an
</font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary
dividend,</font><font>”</font><font> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect
of </font><font>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </font><font>dividend. An </font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary dividend</font><font>”</font><font> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </font><font>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </font><font>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </font><font>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</font></div> <div><font>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </font><font>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </font><font>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution
</font><font>requirements, but not in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders
receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </font><font>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the
amount of money that the </font><font>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </font><font>such amount.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest,
</font><font>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </font><font>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div> <div><font>Investors
considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </font><font>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of
the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </font><font>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any
dividends </font><font>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </font><font>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the date on which a
</font><font>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </font><font>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends
</font><font>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</font></div>
<div><font>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no
net capital </font><font>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </font><font>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</font><font>“</font><font>PFIC</font><font>”</font><font>) losses over post-October</font><font> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </font><font>income)
until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </font><font>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and
other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </font><font>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</font></div>
<div><font>Sales of Shares.
</font><font> </font><font>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable
gain or loss equal to the </font><font>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </font><font>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </font><font>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</font><font> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed
</font><font>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </font><font>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days
</font><font>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </font><font>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </font><font>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
</font><font>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </font><font>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div><font>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or
</font><font>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </font><font>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </font><font>into account in computing gain/loss on the original
shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </font><font>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired
shares. Furthermore, the </font><font>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </font><font>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of
</font><font>mutual funds.</font></div> <div><font>Backup
Withholding. </font><font> </font><font>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and
remit to the U.S. Treasury such </font><font>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </font><font>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not
</font><font>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </font><font>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal
</font><font>income tax liability.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Sections 351 and 362. </font><font> </font><font>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the
</font><font>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </font><font>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would
</font><font>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </font><font>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities,
</font><font>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </font><font>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting
</font><font>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </font><font>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>An Underlying Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward </font><font>contracts, options and
futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent </font><font>permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
(including provisions relating to </font><font>“</font><font>hedging </font><font>transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>straddles</font><font>”</font><font>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the </font><font>Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the
Fund and defer </font><font>Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These </font><font>provisions also (a) will require an Underlying Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat </font><font>them as if they were
closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause an Underlying Fund to recognize income without </font><font>receiving cash with which to pay dividends or make distributions in amounts
necessary to satisfy the distribution </font><font>requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Underlying Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the </font><font>appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon
</font><font>security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of </font><font>these rules and prevent disqualification of an Underlying Fund as a RIC.</font></div> <div><font>An Underlying Fund’s investments in so-called </font><font>“</font><font>Section 1256 contracts,</font><font>”</font><font> such as regulated
futures contracts, most non-U.S. </font><font>currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax </font><font>rules. All Section 1256 contracts held by an Underlying Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their
</font><font>market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in an Underlying Fund’s income as if each </font><font>position had been sold for its fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with </font><font>any gain or loss realized by an Underlying Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.
</font><font>Provided such positions were held as capital assets and were not part of a </font><font>“</font><font>hedging transaction</font><font>”</font><font> nor part of a </font><font>“</font><font>straddle,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such
net gain or loss will be </font><font>treated as short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by an Underlying </font><font>Fund.</font></div> <div><font>As a result of entering into swap contracts, an
Underlying Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. An Underlying </font><font>Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment
of the swap </font><font>or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while </font><font>termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if an
</font><font>Underlying Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, an Underlying </font><font>Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect </font><font>under
certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</font></div> <div><font>Qualified Dividend Income. </font><font> </font><font>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </font><font>capital gains), whether received in
cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </font><font>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund
receives qualified dividend income on the </font><font>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, </font><font>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>non-U.S. corporations that are
not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a </font><font>comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on
an established securities market in the </font><font>U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate </font><font>comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,
</font><font>Canada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech </font><font>Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, </font><font>Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

</font></div> <div><font>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the
shareholder has not held </font><font>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </font><font>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those
</font><font>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </font><font>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date
</font><font>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the </font><font>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to
</font><font>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </font><font>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </font><font>as
qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </font><font>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that
dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </font><font>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after
December </font><font>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </font><font>“</font><font>qualified </font><font>business income</font><font>”</font><font> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </font><font>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </font><font>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a
</font><font>Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.</font><font>  </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund </font><font>from the Underlying Funds and that are attributable to dividends paid by U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal
</font><font>dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 </font><font>days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to
ex-dividend</font><font> date for certain preference dividends) during which risk of loss may not be diminished is required for the applicable </font><font>shares, at the Fund level, the Underlying Fund level and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends
</font><font>received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to the investment.</font></div>
<div><font>Excess Inclusion Income. </font><font> </font><font>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</font><font>“</font><font>UBTI</font><font>”</font><font>) from </font><font>being realized by their tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could
realize UBTI </font><font>by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt </font><font>shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received by an </font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or
other investments may </font><font>cause the Fund to report some or all of its distributions as </font><font>“</font><font>excess inclusion income.</font><font>”</font><font> To Fund shareholders,
such excess </font><font>inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt </font><font>such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not
</font><font>be offset by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. </font><font>shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund or Underlying Fund to be subject to tax if certain
</font><font>“</font><font>disqualified
organizations,</font><font>”</font><font> as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder
</font><font>annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a </font><font>taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</font></div> <div><font>A Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be
</font><font>successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT </font><font>may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </font><font>Avoidance of
investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </font><font>investment opportunities.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Non-U.S.
Investments. </font><font> </font><font>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses
attributable to fluctuations in </font><font>exchange rates between the time an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities </font><font>denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the
time an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities </font><font>are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be
</font><font>treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the </font><font>currencies in which the instruments are denominated.

</font><font>may not be deductible under certain circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor. The Underlying </font><font>Funds, if invested in non-U.S. positions, may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes and non-U.S. financial transactions taxes.
</font><font>Each Underlying Fund that is permitted to do so may elect to </font><font>“</font><font>pass through</font><font>”</font><font> to its investors, including the
Funds, the amount </font><font>of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Underlying Fund. If more than 50% of the total assets of an Underlying Fund at the </font><font>close of a year consist of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where
</font><font>traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as </font><font>“</font><font>non-U.S.</font><font>”</font><font>) (and 50% of the total assets of the
Fund at the close of the year </font><font>consists of non-U.S. securities, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of Underlying Funds), the Funds may be eligible to elect </font><font>to </font><font>“</font><font>pass through</font><font>”</font><font> such amounts to their stockholders and may do so, depending upon circumstances.</font></div>
<div><font>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. </font><font> </font><font>If an Underlying Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal </font><font>income tax on a portion of any </font><font>“</font><font>excess
distribution</font><font>”</font><font> or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is </font><font>distributed as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed
</font><font>on the Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div> <div><font>If an Underlying Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a </font><font>“</font><font>qualified electing fund</font><font>”</font><font> under the Internal
</font><font>Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, an Underlying Fund might be required to include in income each year a </font><font>portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying </font><font>Fund, and such
amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to </font><font>make this election, an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it
</font><font>invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain.</font></div> <div><font>Alternatively, an Underlying Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in an</font><font> </font><font>Underlying Fund being treated </font><font>as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, an
Underlying Fund would report any </font><font>such gains as ordinary income and would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized </font><font>gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by an Underlying Fund and, once made, would be effective </font><font>for
all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, an Underlying Fund </font><font>could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with
respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any </font><font>particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds
</font><font>from dispositions of PFIC stock. An Underlying Fund may have to distribute this </font><font>“</font><font>phantom</font><font>”</font><font> income and gain to satisfy the </font><font>90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</font></div> <div><font>An Underlying Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to
</font><font>mitigate the effects of these rules.</font></div> <div><font>Reporting. </font><font> </font><font>If
a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </font><font>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the
shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </font><font>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement,
</font><font>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </font><font>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </font><font>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font></div>
<div><font>Other Taxes.
</font><font> </font><font>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional
state, local and non-U.S. </font><font>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div> <div><font>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </font><font>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate
specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </font><font>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or
long-term capital gains are generally </font><font>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </font><font>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding
</font><font>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>dividends are effectively connected with the
non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </font><font>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the
non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </font><font>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </font><font>“</font><font>branch </font><font>profits tax</font><font>”</font><font> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN,
</font><font>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div><font>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of
the </font><font>Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified net
interest income</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent
</font><font>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </font><font>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of the Fund’s
</font><font>“</font><font>qualified short-term </font><font>capital
gains</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s
long-term capital loss for such </font><font>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, the Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </font><font>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole
</font><font>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</font><font> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in
</font><font>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </font><font>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or
</font><font>qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of </font><font>these rules to their accounts.</font></div> <div><font>Special rules may apply
to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </font><font>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S.
real property holding corporations (as defined in the </font><font>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a
</font><font>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </font><font>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of
</font><font>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </font><font>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding
</font><font>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</font></div> <div><font>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is
</font><font>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </font><font>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of
</font><font>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </font><font>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </font><font>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</font></div> <div><font>The rules laid out in the previous two paragraphs, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding a Fund's or an
</font><font>Underlying Fund's participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</font></div> <div><font>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the
</font><font>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i)
</font><font>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </font><font>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </font><font>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will
</font><font>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, </font><font>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence
</font><font>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </font><font>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to
</font><font>account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their </font><font>account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local
</font><font>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, </font><font>and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership
</font><font>unless certain exceptions apply.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Introduction to
BlackRock</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of
</font><font>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </font><font>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </font><font>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </font><font>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the
</font><font>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</font></div> <div><font>Philosophy on investment stewardship</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders
</font><font>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </font><font>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they
</font><font>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </font><font>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws.
</font><font>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </font><font>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of
</font><font>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </font><font>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of
</font><font>“</font><font>one share, one </font><font>vote</font><font>”</font><font> helps achieve this balance.</font></div> <div><font>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our
</font><font>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </font><font>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast
</font><font>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </font><font>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </font><font>who have
given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</font><font>1</font><font> We also contribute to </font><font>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with
our clients’ interests as </font><font>long-term shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and
</font><font>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </font><font>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where
</font><font>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </font><font>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our
</font><font>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </font><font>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular
</font><font>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </font><font>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and
</font><font>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </font><font>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial
</font><font>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </font><font>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div><font>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with
</font><font>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </font><font>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our
</font><font>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </font><font>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with
</font><font>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</font></div> <div><font>Key Themes</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of
corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </font><font>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a
company’s ability to </font><font>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </font><font>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the
</font><font>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </font><font>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div><font>These Principles cover seven key themes:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Compensation and benefits</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Other corporate
governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>Our regional and market-specific </font><font>voting guidelines</font><font>
explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </font><font>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</font></div>
<div><font>Boards and directors</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Our primary focus is on the
performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </font><font>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of
shareholders’ interests. As part of their </font><font>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </font><font>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and
</font><font>impactful responsibilities.</font></div> <div><font>We support
boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </font><font>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks
and opportunities,</font><font>2</font><font> as well as the </font><font>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </font><font>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </font><font>to
support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </font><font>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks
and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </font><font>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create
value is essential </font><font>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </font><font>mitigated.</font></div> <div><font>Where a company has not adequately
disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </font><font>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular
responsibility for the issue. We </font><font>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </font><font>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In
</font><font>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</font></div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Supporting and
overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </font><font>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address
anticipated or actual obstacles to success</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
</div> <div> </div> <div> <div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>2</font></div>
<div><font>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and
value creation in a company’s business model that have an </font><font>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water
use, land use, waste </font><font>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </font><font>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </font><font>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </font><font>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </font><font>component of a sound governance framework.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

</div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>There should be clear descriptions of the role of the
board and the committees of the board and how they engage with and </font><font>oversee management. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a commitment to acting
in the </font><font>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the company, </font><font>board, or
individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </font><font>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and
governance processes, we consider local market norms and </font><font>regulations.</font></div> <div><font>Regular accountability</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</font><font> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </font><font>timely
manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </font><font>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all
directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </font><font>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</font></div>
<div><font>Effective board composition</font></div>
<div><font>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the
</font><font>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </font><font>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </font><font>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the
</font><font>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage
</font><font>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </font><font>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a
</font><font>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</font></div>
<div><font>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue
influence </font><font>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </font><font>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the
company</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Interlocking
directorships</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Having any other
interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </font><font>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the
company and their shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><font>In our
experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </font><font>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair
is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </font><font>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent
</font><font>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and
</font><font>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </font><font>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and
</font><font>contextualize a company’s approach.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors,

<div> <div><font>When nominating new directors to the board, we
look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </font><font>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board
composition. </font><font>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </font><font>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics
</font><font>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </font><font>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and
</font><font>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</font></div>
<div><font>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity
of </font><font>thought and avoiding </font><font>“</font><font>group
think</font><font>”</font><font> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows
</font><font>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </font><font>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </font><font>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</font></div> <div><font>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </font><font>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the
</font><font>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </font><font>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least
</font><font>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </font><font>take time.</font></div> <div><font>This position is based on our view that
diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </font><font>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies.
Academic research already </font><font>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</font><font>4</font><font> In </font><font>our experience,
greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </font><font>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also
promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </font><font>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect
</font><font>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</font></div> <div><font>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </font><font>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees
</font><font>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </font><font>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction,
</font><font>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</font></div> <div><font>Sufficient capacity</font></div>
<div><font>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate
</font><font>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </font><font>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </font><font>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a
</font><font>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </font><font>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</font></div> <div><font>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under
</font><font>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </font><font>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate
</font><font>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </font><font>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a
</font><font>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </font><font>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance
</font><font>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent,
play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </font><font>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction,
non-financial </font><font>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </font><font>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </font><font>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </font><font>Audit
committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </font><font>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of
the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </font><font>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor
in </font><font>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </font><font>oversee those functions.</font></div> <div><font>We take particular note of
unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </font><font>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit
committees should provide timely disclosure on </font><font>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</font></div>
<div><font>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on
</font><font>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </font><font>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </font><font>should
have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </font><font>process.</font></div>
<div><font>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management
</font><font>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </font><font>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </font><font>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to
</font><font>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately
</font><font>managing risk.</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment
and the priority of </font><font>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </font><font>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</font></div>
<div><font>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding
principle </font><font>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </font><font>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</font></div> <div><font>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </font><font>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and
</font><font>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </font><font>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time,
</font><font>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </font><font>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</font></div> <div><font>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal
</font><font>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </font><font>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while
</font><font>minimizing costs to shareholders.</font></div> <div><font>In
assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </font><font>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards
proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </font><font>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can
enhance long-term </font><font>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </font><font>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </font><font>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </font><font>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </font><font>a
best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </font><font>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a
separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>A-8</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>As a matter of sound governance practice,
shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </font><font>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit
shareholders’ ability to sell their </font><font>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </font><font>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We
</font><font>encourage any so-called </font><font>“</font><font>shareholder
rights plans</font><font>”</font><font> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </font><font>introduction and periodically thereafter.</font></div> <div><font>Compensation and benefits</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a
compensation </font><font>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </font><font>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </font><font>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies
</font><font>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </font><font>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </font><font>guard
against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </font><font>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred
compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </font><font>market practice.</font></div> <div><font>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has
</font><font>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </font><font>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer
</font><font>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the
</font><font>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </font><font>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </font><font>outperformance
against peer firms.</font></div> <div><font>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive
plans such that executives would be </font><font>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </font><font>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior
</font><font>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </font><font>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</font></div> <div><font>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in
</font><font>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </font><font>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with
</font><font>overseeing.</font></div> <div><font>We use third party
research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </font><font>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members for poor compensation practices </font><font>or structures.</font></div> <div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and
</font><font>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </font><font>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div><font>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </font><font>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related
</font><font>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </font><font>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </font><font>disclosures are inadequate.</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock encourages
companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </font><font>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business
model and to supplement that </font><font>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </font><font>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards </font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>(IFRS) Foundation.</font><font>5</font><font> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk disclosure, the four
pillars of </font><font>the TCFD governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets are a useful way for companies to disclose how </font><font>they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. SASB’s industry-specific </font><font>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
</font><font>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </font><font>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality
</font><font>of these issues for many businesses.</font><font>6</font><font> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </font><font>be required by regulation, or one of a
number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </font><font>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</font></div>
<div><font>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various
</font><font>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </font><font>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </font><font>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and
</font><font>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</font></div> <div><font>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational
</font><font>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </font><font>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and
</font><font>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </font><font>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help
</font><font>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</font></div> <div><font>Climate risk</font></div> <div><font>It
is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </font><font>investors we are interested in understanding how
companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </font><font>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how
these factors are </font><font>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </font><font>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term
</font><font>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </font><font>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of
1.5°C.</font><font>7</font><font> It is, of course, up to each company to define </font><font>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</font></div> <div><font>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by
</font><font>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </font><font>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </font><font>can
benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </font><font>transition.</font><font>8</font><font> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy
moving at different </font><font>speeds.</font><font>9</font><font> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in
</font><font>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </font><font>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they
</font><font>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </font><font>their business model and sector.</font></div> <div><font>We look to
companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </font><font>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions
(GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </font><font>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to

<div><font>The
</font><font>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation</font><font> announced in November
2021 the formation of an </font><font>International Sustainability
</font><font>Standards Board (ISSB)</font><font> to develop a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality
sustainability disclosure standards to meet investors’ information </font><font>needs. SASB standards will over time be adapted to ISSB standards but are the reference reporting tool in
the meantime.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>6</font></div> <div><font>While guidance is still under development for a unified disclosure framework related to natural capital, the emerging recommendations of the </font><font>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), may prove useful to some companies.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<div><font>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated
efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </font><font>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us
to do so, we </font><font>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>8</font></div> <div><font>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </font><font>transition as compared to the alternative. This better macro environment will support better economic growth, financial stability, job growth, </font><font>productivity, as well as ecosystem stability and health outcomes.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>use and contribute to the development of low
carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </font><font>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy
sources, including oil and </font><font>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </font><font>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy
</font><font>sources is consistent with their strategy.</font></div> <div><font>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory
</font><font>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </font><font>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </font><font>basis
as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </font><font>risk.</font></div>
<div><font>Key stakeholder interests</font></div>
<div><font>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various
parties on </font><font>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </font><font>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </font><font>business
partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </font><font>operate.</font></div>
<div><font>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent
to </font><font>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </font><font>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business
</font><font>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </font><font>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse
</font><font>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </font><font>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</font></div> <div><font>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified
</font><font>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </font><font>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </font><font>strategy and purpose.</font></div> <div><font>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> <div><font>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of
</font><font>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </font><font>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help
</font><font>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </font><font>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </font><font>changes to
governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </font><font>shareholders.</font></div>
<div><font>Corporate Form</font></div>
<div><font>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the
company’s </font><font>purpose and business model.</font><font>10</font><font> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </font><font>similar entity should put it to a
shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </font><font>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form
should clearly articulate </font><font>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </font><font>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management
</font><font>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </font><font>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div>
<div><font>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be
voted </font><font>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </font><font>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms,
</font><font>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock is subject to certain requirements under
antitrust law in the United States that place restrictions and limitations on </font><font>how BlackRock can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including
our ability to submit </font><font>shareholder proposals. As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </font><font>others.</font></div> <div><font>When assessing shareholder proposals, we
evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </font><font>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as
well as its materiality and </font><font>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </font><font>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that
</font><font>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</font></div> <div><font>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and
</font><font>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to
</font><font>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </font><font>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support
</font><font>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </font><font>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded
</font><font>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </font><font>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </font><font>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how
</font><font>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </font><font>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</font></div>
<div><font>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Oversight</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BlackRock maintains three
regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </font><font>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of
senior BlackRock investment professionals </font><font>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and </font><font>advise on amendments to BIS proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (Guidelines). The
</font><font>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</font></div> <div><font>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </font><font>(Global
Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment </font><font>teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment
Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior executives </font><font>with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which
</font><font>are the responsibility of BIS.</font></div> <div><font>The
Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </font><font>require the application of professional judgment and
consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </font><font>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves
</font><font>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</font></div> <div><font>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on
</font><font>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </font><font>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and the Guidelines.</font></div>
<div><font>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including
</font><font>maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on </font><font>corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important
</font><font>developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and </font><font>performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal
</font><font>discussion with the relevant investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a </font><font>voting decision.</font></div>

<div> <div><font>consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for which we have voting authority. </font><font>BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on
our evaluation </font><font>of the best long-term economic interests of our clients as shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business </font><font>judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident
</font><font>shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </font><font>“</font><font>Conflicts management policies and
procedures</font><font>”</font><font>, below).</font></div> <div><font>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the
</font><font>relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </font><font>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory
</font><font>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </font><font>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term
</font><font>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</font></div> <div><font>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed-income securities or the securities of privately
</font><font>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </font><font>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</font></div>
<div><font>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such
proxies, as well as </font><font>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </font><font>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv)
</font><font>“</font><font>share-blocking</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their
holdings for some </font><font>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </font><font>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting
</font><font>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </font><font>burdensome administrative requirements.</font></div> <div><font>As a
consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </font><font>“</font><font>best-efforts</font><font>”</font><font> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it
</font><font>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </font><font>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote
</font><font>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</font></div> <div><font>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic
</font><font>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </font><font>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes
</font><font>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because
</font><font>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform </font><font>manner.</font></div> <div><font>Conflicts
management policies and procedures</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such
</font><font>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </font><font>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees.

</font><font>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</font></div> <div><font>Securities lending</font></div>
<div><font>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a
well-regulated </font><font>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </font><font>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</font></div>
<div><font>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by
our </font><font>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </font><font>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in
</font><font>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </font><font>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</font></div>
<div><font>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is
based on an </font><font>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </font><font>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall
</font><font>consideration).</font><font>12</font><font> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </font><font>the costs and
benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</font></div> <div><font>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining
whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </font><font>modify it as necessary.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>12</font></div>
<div><font>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United
States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </font><font>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy
statement, determine that a vote has a </font><font>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh
</font><font>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </font><font>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </font><font>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income
Ratings</font></div> <div><font>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the time of issuance by a credit rating
agency designated as a </font><font>NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the </font><font>ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a
</font><font>particular subsequent date.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>NRSROs may rate specific investments
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds), issuers (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) </font><font>and/or programs (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, commercial
paper programs). However, certain types of investments may not be rated by NRSROs, </font><font>such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time
deposits at financial </font><font>institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury </font><font>securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s </font><font>issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same </font><font>NRSRO
rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal </font><font>securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings
for the same security (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>underlying,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>“</font><font>insured</font><font>”</font><font> and/or </font><font>“</font><font>enhanced</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</font></div> <div><font>New issue securities (regardless of type) may not be rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary
</font><font>prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities may include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the </font><font>underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase
</font><font>a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: </font><font>(i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s </font><font>rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect </font><font>to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the performance of an index that includes credit ratings
eligibility criteria </font><font>as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined </font><font>by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may </font><font>differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are </font><font>not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index
</font><font>methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index,
</font><font>following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or </font><font>restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</font></div> <div><font>Fixed-income securities which are unrated may expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay
</font><font>principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the </font><font>investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>Investors should note that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of
recent </font><font>developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Securities deemed to be high yield
are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</font></div> <div><font>The descriptions
below relate to general long-term and short-term obligations of an issuer.</font></div> <div><font>Moody’s
Ratings</font></div> <div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div>
<div><font>Aaa:</font><font> Obligations rated Aaa are judged
to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div> <div><font>Aa:</font><font> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>A:</font><font> Obligations rated A
are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Baa:</font><font> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such
may possess </font><font>certain speculative characteristics.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>B-1</font></div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_c0122748-eab8-4214-87ad-d68a4ae95139_2"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Ba:</font><font> Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.</font><font>
</font></div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Obligations rated B
are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</font></div> <div><font>Caa:</font><font> Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative, of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div> <div><font>Ca:</font><font> Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some
prospect of recovery of </font><font>principal and interest.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>C:</font><font> Obligations rated C are the lowest
rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div><font>Note:</font><font> Moody's appends numerical
modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The </font><font>modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category;
the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range</font><font> ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>
<div><font>Absence of Rating:</font><font> Where no rating
has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons </font><font>unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>Should no rating be assigned, the
reason may be one of the following:</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>1. An application was not received or accepted.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</font></div>
<div><font>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the issue or issuer.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>4. The issue was privately placed,
in which case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</font></div> <div><font>Withdrawal may occur if new and
material circumstances arise, the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is </font><font>no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if
a bond is called for redemption; or for </font><font>other reasons.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Short-Term
Obligations</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations,
generally with </font><font>an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</font></div> <div><font>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</font></div> <div><font>P-1: </font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt
obligations.</font></div> <div><font>P-2:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div><font>P-3: </font><font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div> <div><font>NP:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div><font>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</font></div>
<div><font>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal obligations that are considered investment-grade and are </font><font>designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are
</font><font>designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation.</font></div> <div><font>MIG 1:</font><font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established
cash flows, highly </font><font>reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.</font></div>
<div><font>MIG 2:</font><font> This designation denotes
strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the </font><font>preceding group.</font></div>
<div><font>MIG 3:</font><font> This designation denotes
acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market </font><font>access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>SG:</font><font> This designation denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins </font><font>of
protection.</font></div> <div><font>S&amp;P Global Ratings</font></div>
<div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>AAA:</font><font> An obligation rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s
capacity to meet its </font><font>financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>AA:</font><font> An obligation rated AA differs
from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet </font><font>its financial commitment is very strong.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>A:</font><font> An obligation rated A is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic
</font><font>conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation is still strong.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BBB:</font><font> An obligation rated BBB exhibits
adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing </font><font>circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial
commitment on the </font><font>obligation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:</font><font> Obligations
rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. </font><font>BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations
will likely have some quality and </font><font>protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>BB:</font><font> An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing
</font><font>uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate </font><font>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>B:</font><font> An obligation rated B is more
vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the </font><font>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or
economic conditions will likely </font><font>impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>CCC:</font><font> An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, </font><font>and
economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse </font><font>business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not
likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div><font>CC:</font><font> An obligation rated CC is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet </font><font>occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty,
regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div> <div><font>C:</font><font> An obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative
</font><font>seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div> <div><font>D:</font><font> An obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital
instruments, the D rating </font><font>category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that </font><font>such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the
</font><font>stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </font><font>of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An
</font><font>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div> <div><font>NR:</font><font> NR indicates no rating has been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a
rating, or that S&amp;P </font><font>Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div> <div><font>Note:</font><font> The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standing </font><font>within the major rating categories.</font><font> </font></div>

<div> <div><font>A-1: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet
</font><font>its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign </font><font>(+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div><font>A-2: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated
A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and </font><font>economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's
capacity to meet its financial </font><font>commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.</font></div> <div><font>A-3: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic
conditions or </font><font>changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation.</font></div> <div><font>B: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor
</font><font>currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead </font><font>to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</font></div> <div><font>C: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable
business, </font><font>financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div><font>D: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated D is
in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D </font><font>rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless
S&amp;P Global Ratings believes </font><font>that such payments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business </font><font>days will be treated as five business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </font><font>of a similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </font><font>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div> <div><font>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>An
S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks </font><font>unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less
will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more </font><font>than three years will most likely receive a long-term debt rating.</font></div>
<div><font>SP-1:</font><font> Strong capacity to pay
principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service </font><font>is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div><font>SP-2:</font><font> Satisfactory capacity to pay
principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes </font><font>over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div><font>SP-3:</font><font> Speculative capacity to pay
principal and interest.</font></div> <div><font>Fitch Ratings</font></div>
<div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>AAA:</font><font> Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned
only in cases of </font><font>exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected </font><font>by foreseeable events.</font></div> <div><font>AA:</font><font> Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for
</font><font>payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div> <div><font>A:</font><font> High credit quality. A ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of
financial commitments is </font><font>considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is </font><font>the case for higher ratings.</font></div>
<div><font>BBB:</font><font> Good credit quality. BBB ratings
indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of </font><font>financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions
are more likely to impair this </font><font>capacity.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>BB:</font><font> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in
</font><font>business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial </font><font>commitments to be met.</font></div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</font></div> <div><font>CCC:</font><font> Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div><font>CC:</font><font> Very high levels of credit risk.
CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</font><font> </font></div> <div><font>C:</font><font> Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit
risk.</font></div> <div><font>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C
rating categories, </font><font>depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have </font><font>comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</font></div> <div><font>Note: The modifiers </font><font>“</font><font>+</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>-</font><font>”</font><font> may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such </font><font>suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories </font><font>below CCC.</font></div> <div><font>The
subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The </font><font>designation is intended to make clear that the
rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant </font><font>to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in
all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for </font><font>analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is
to any degree subject to </font><font>market risk.</font></div> <div><font>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</font></div> <div><font>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or </font><font>security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the
</font><font>relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as
</font><font>“</font><font>short-term</font><font>”</font><font> based on </font><font>market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and
up to 36 </font><font>months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</font></div> <div><font>F1:</font><font> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of
financial commitments; </font><font>may have an added </font><font>“</font><font>+</font><font>”</font><font> to denote any exceptionally strong credit
feature.</font></div> <div><font>F2:</font><font> Good
short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div><font>F3:</font><font> Fair short-term credit quality.
The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened
</font><font>vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div> <div><font>C:</font><font> High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div>
<div><font>RD:</font><font> Restricted default. Indicates an
entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it </font><font>continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings
only.</font></div> <div><font>D:</font><font> Default.

<div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> <div><font>AAA: </font><font>Highest credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is exceptionally high
and unlikely to be </font><font>adversely affected by future events.</font></div> <div><font>AA: </font><font>Superior credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is considered high.
Credit quality differs from </font><font>AAA only to a small degree. Unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>A: </font><font>Good credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is substantial, but of lesser credit quality than AA. </font><font>May be vulnerable to future events, but qualifying negative factors are considered manageable.</font></div> <div><font>BBB: </font><font>Adequate credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is considered
acceptable. May be </font><font>vulnerable to future events.</font></div> <div><font>BB: </font><font>Speculative, non investment-grade credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations
is uncertain. </font><font>Vulnerable to future events.</font></div> <div><font>B: </font><font>Highly speculative credit quality. There is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to meet
financial obligations.</font></div> <div><font>CCC / CC / C: </font><font>Very highly speculative credit quality. In danger of defaulting on financial obligations. There is little difference </font><font>between
these three categories, although CC and C ratings are normally applied to obligations that are seen as highly likely to </font><font>default, or subordinated to obligations rated in the CCC to
B range. Obligations in respect of which default has not technically </font><font>taken place but is considered inevitable may be rated in the C category.</font></div>
<div><font>D:</font><font> When the issuer has filed under
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up statute or there is a failure to satisfy </font><font>an obligation after the exhaustion of grace periods, a downgrade to D may
occur.</font></div> <div><font>Note:</font><font> All rating
categories other than AAA and D also contain subcategories </font><font>“</font><font>(high)</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>(low)</font><font>”</font><font>. The absence of either a </font><font>“</font><font>(high)</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>(low)</font><font>”</font><font> designation indicates the rating is in the middle of the category.</font></div>

<div><font>R-1 (high): </font><font>Highest credit quality.
The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall due is </font><font>exceptionally high. Unlikely to be adversely affected by future events.</font></div>
<div><font>R-1 (middle): </font><font>Superior credit
quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall due is very </font><font>high. Differs from R-1 (high) by a relatively modest degree. Unlikely to be
significantly vulnerable to future events.</font></div> <div><font>R-1 (low): </font><font>Good credit quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall due is substantial.
</font><font>Overall strength is not as favorable as higher rating categories. May be vulnerable to future events, but qualifying negative </font><font>factors are considered manageable.</font></div>
<div><font>R-2 (high): </font><font>Upper end of adequate
credit quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall </font><font>due is acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events.</font></div>
<div><font>R-2 (middle): </font><font>Adequate credit
quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall due is </font><font>acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events or may be exposed to other factors that
could reduce credit quality.</font></div> <div><font>R-2 (low): </font><font>Lower end of adequate credit quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall </font><font>due is
acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events. A number of challenges are present that could affect the issuer's ability </font><font>to meet such obligations.</font></div>
<div><font>R-3: </font><font>Lowest end of adequate credit
quality. There is a capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they fall </font><font>due. May be vulnerable to future events and the certainty of meeting such obligations
could be impacted by a variety of </font><font>developments.</font></div> <div><font>R-4: </font><font>Speculative credit quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they
fall due is uncertain.</font></div> <div><font>R-5: </font><font>Highly speculative credit quality. There is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to meet short-term financial
</font><font>obligations as they fall due.</font></div> <div><font>D:</font><font> When the issuer has filed under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up statute or there is
a failure to satisfy </font><font>an obligation after the exhaustion of grace periods, a downgrade to D may occur.</font></div> <div><font>IS-SAI-LIFEPATH-0124</font></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
