<p><font size="2"><b><i>The information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, the Summary Prospectus, Prospectus and SAI for the Fund.
</i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2">On December 5, 2011, in connection with the establishment of the Fund, the Board of Trustees of the Trust approved the planned
liquidation, dissolution and termination of the Fund. As a result, the last day of trading in the Fund on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) will be September 3, 2019. NYSE Arca will suspend trading in the Fund before the open of trading
on September 4, 2019, and shares of the Fund will no longer be available for new investments as of this date. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on September 9, 2019. The Fund’s final net
asset value, as calculated on September 3, 2019, will include any costs associated with the liquidation expected to be borne by the Fund. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Because
shares of the Fund will not be traded on NYSE Arca during the period between September 4, 2019 and September 9, 2019, we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your shares. Further, during this period, the Fund will be
in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio, which will result in the Fund not being able to track its Underlying Index, and the Fund will hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with its investment objective and
strategies. After September 3, 2019, shareholders that remain invested in the Fund will receive the entire amount of their <i>pro rata </i>share of the liquidation proceeds on or about September 9, 2019, subject to their brokerage
firm’s processes. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund prior to September 4, 2019 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage
commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. If you still hold shares of the Fund on September 9, 2019, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value as of the close of business
</font></p>

on September 3, 2019, which will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you are subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a
capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare tax exempt or taxable distributions of its investment income and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any
liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss depending on your tax basis. Please refer to the “Taxes”
disclosure beginning on page 67 of the SAI and consult your own tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of the Fund’s liquidation, including any state, local, foreign or other tax consequences. </font></p>
