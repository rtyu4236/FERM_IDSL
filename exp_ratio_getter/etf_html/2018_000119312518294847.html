discretionary sectors in the U.S. and Canada, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”). The Underlying Index includes companies in the following categories: producers of sophisticated
computer-related devices; providers of communications equipment and internet services; producers of computer and internet software; consultants for information technology; providers of computer services; semiconductors and semiconductor equipment
manufacturers; and select company engaging in content and information creation or distribution. The Underlying Index may include large-, <font>mid-</font> or small-capitalization companies. </font></p>

the world, specifically in the area of <font>pre-marketing</font> clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the communication
services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the
products and services of certain communications companies obsolete. The domestic telecommunications market is characterized by increasing competition and regulation by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and various state regulatory
authorities. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an
advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or
other negative effects in the future. Companies in the media and entertainment industries (e.g., companies engaged in television or radio broadcasting, publishing, motion pictures, music by recording artists, casinos, and recreation and amusement
businesses) can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of
targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in state and federal government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an
important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue. </font></p>
