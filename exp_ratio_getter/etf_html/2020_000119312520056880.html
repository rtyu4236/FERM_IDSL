<div>Before you invest, you may want to review the Fund’s
prospectus, which contains more information about the Fund and its risks. You can find the Fund’s prospectus (including amendments and supplements) and other information about the Fund, including the Fund’s statement of additional
information and shareholder report, online at https://www.ishares.com/prospectus. You can also get this information at no cost by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or by sending an e-mail request to iSharesETFs@blackrock.com, or from your

Prospectus.</div> <div>
<div>Beginning on January 1, 2021, as permitted
by regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), paper copies of the Fund’s shareholder reports will no longer be sent by mail, unless you specifically request paper copies of the reports from your
financial intermediary, such as a broker-dealer or bank. Instead, the reports will be made available on a website, and you will be notified by mail each time a report is posted and provided with a website link to access the report.</div>
<div>If you already elected to receive

<div>iShares<sup>®</sup></div>
<div>On December 7, 2012, in connection with the establishment of
the Fund, the Board of Trustees of the Trust approved the planned liquidation, dissolution and termination of the Fund. As a result, the last day of trading in the Fund on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) will be March 30, 2020. NYSE Arca
will suspend trading in the Fund before the open of trading on March 31, 2020 and shares of the Fund will no longer be available for new investments as of this date. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on
April 2, 2020. The Fund’s final net asset value, as calculated on March 30, 2020, will include any costs associated with the liquidation expected to be borne by the Fund.</div>
<div>Because shares of the Fund will not be traded on NYSE Arca
during the period between March 31, 2020 and April 2, 2020, we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your shares. Further, during this period, the Fund will be in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio, which
may result in the Fund not being able to track its Underlying Index (by March 31, 2020, the Underlying Index value will be represented almost entirely by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying Index). After March 30, 2020, shareholders
that remain invested in the Fund will receive the entire amount of their pro rata share of the liquidation proceeds on or about April 2, 2020, subject to their brokerage firm’s processes.</div>
<div>Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund prior to March
31, 2020 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. If you still hold shares of the Fund on April 2, 2020, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value
as of the close of business on March 30, 2020, which will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date.</div>
<div>If you are subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of
the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the
Fund may declare tax exempt or taxable distributions of its investment income and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and
will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss depending on your tax basis. Please refer to the “Taxes” disclosure beginning on page 66 of the SAI and consult your own tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of the
Fund’s liquidation, including any state, local, foreign or other tax consequences.</div>

<div>The iShares iBonds Mar 2020 Term Corporate ex-Financials ETF
(the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds, excluding financials, maturing after March 31, 2019 and before April 1, 2020.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”).</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Example. <font>This Example is
intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those
periods. Fund expenses (and any applicable waivers) are calculated only through March 31, 2020 because the Fund is scheduled to cease operations and liquidate by that date. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year
and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:</font></div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 3% of the average value
of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal Investment
Strategies</div> <div>The Fund is a term fund that will terminate on
or about March 31, 2020, at which time it will distribute its remaining net assets to shareholders. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Bloomberg Barclays 2020 Maturity High Quality Corporate Index (the “Underlying
Index”), which is composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, taxable, investment-grade (as determined by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg”)) corporate bonds, scheduled to mature after March
31,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>2019 and before April 1, 2020, and excludes financial issuers. As of October
31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer staples industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. The Fund does not seek to return any
predetermined amount at maturity or in periodic distributions.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated,
investment-grade securities publicly issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporate issuers that have $300 million or more of outstanding face value at the time of inclusion. The Fund’s investment in non-U.S. corporate issuers initially will consist
primarily of corporate bonds issued by companies domiciled in developed countries. The Fund will invest in non-U.S. issuers to the extent necessary for it to track the Underlying Index. Each bond must be registered with the SEC, have been exempt
from registration at issuance, or have been offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) with registration rights. Further, the securities in the Underlying Index must be denominated in U.S.
dollars and have</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>a fixed-rate, although they can carry a coupon that steps-up or changes
according to a predetermined schedule. In addition, to be included in the Underlying Index, securities that are rated by all three of the rating agencies below must be rated “investment-grade” by at least two of the three agencies,
defined as Baa3 or higher by Moody’s<sup>®</sup> Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- or higher by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings, Inc. When ratings
from only two of the three rating agencies are available, the lower rating is used to determine eligibility. Securities with a rating from only one of the three ratings agencies must be rated investment-grade to be included in the Underlying
Index.</div> <div>The Underlying Index is constructed with the
following methodology. A parent index, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index, representing U.S. dollar-denominated, taxable, investment-grade corporate bonds, is stripped of financial issuers, stripped of securities maturing outside of the
maturity range as defined above, and divided into two subsets by rating. One subset contains Aaa - A3 rated bonds, and the other contains Baa1 - Baa3 rated bonds. During the final two years of the Underlying Index, bonds that had been screened out
of the parent index due to being within one year of maturity will be added back into the Underlying Index until such issues reach maturity. Securities are then market-cap weighted within each subset, with a 3% cap on any one issuer, and a <font>pro rata</font> distribution of any excess weight across the remaining issuers in the subset. The two subsets are then combined in a proportion required to achieve an initial weighted average rating of approximately A2.
The securities in the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index are updated on the last calendar day of each month until one
year prior to March 31, 2020. During this final one-year period, the Underlying Index will no longer be updated or rebalanced, except to remove securities which are downgraded below investment-grade by any of the three ratings agencies.
Additionally, during this period, existing bond weights will be allowed to float based on changes in market value, and the average weighted rating previously described will not apply. If bond ratings change during this time, weights will not be
adjusted, which means that the average credit quality may change over time as bond ratings change and securities are added to and removed from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>When a bond that is included in the Underlying Index matures,
its maturity value will be represented in the Underlying Index by cash throughout the remaining life of the Underlying Index. As the Fund approaches its termination date, its holdings of money market or similar funds may increase, causing the Fund
to incur the fees and expenses of these funds. By March 31, 2020, the Underlying Index value will be represented almost entirely by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund is a series of the iShares iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series of bond exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) sponsored by BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). The iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series do not invest in U.S. savings bonds or other U.S. government bonds (except to the extent the funds hold cash equivalent
instruments consistent with their investment objectives) and are not designed to provide protection against inflation.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and
liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund’s operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates
(“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at
least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the
Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund. In the last months of operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested by the Fund in bonds but instead will be held in cash and cash equivalents. By March
31, 2020, the Underlying Index is expected to consist almost entirely of cash earned in this manner. Around the same time, the Fund will wind up and terminate, and its net assets will be distributed to then-current shareholders pursuant to a plan of
liquidation.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities representing up
to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div> </div>

<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
Prospectus) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to
trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Cash Management Risk<font>. </font><font>If a significant amount of the Fund’s assets are invested in cash and cash equivalents, the Fund may underperform other funds that do not similarly invest in cash and cash equivalents for
investment purposes and/or to collateralize derivative instruments.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>types, group of project types, sector or asset class.</div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Declining Yield Risk.<font> During the twelve months prior to the Fund’s planned termination date, the Fund’s yield will generally tend to move toward prevailing money market rates and may be lower than the yields of
the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</font></div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that vary over
time. It is expected that an investment in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of bonds of similar credit quality and maturity. Unlike a direct investment in bonds, the
breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment. For example, at times during the Fund's existence it may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon
payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which would result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of
your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may experience a gain or loss for tax
purposes.</font></div> <div>Illiquid Investments Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of
in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the
Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held
by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near
maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. As the Fund does not seek to return any predetermined amount at maturity or in periodic distributions, the amount of
income generated by the Fund may vary during its term. In addition, the Fund's income is expected to decline in the months leading up to its maturity date because its portfolio will increasingly consist of cash and cash equivalents.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index
data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an
adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</div> <div>Interest
Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income
markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure.The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund
is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a
significant impact on the Fund and its investments.</div> <div>Market
Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in
secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Money Market Instruments Risk.<font> The value of money market instruments may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the credit ratings of the investments. If a significant amount of the Fund's assets are invested in
money market instruments, it will be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or any other
government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money market funds other than government money market funds or retail money market funds “float” their NAV instead of using a stable $1.00 per share
price.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be
inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privately Issued Securities Risk. <font>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities are
securities that have not been registered under the 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to legal restrictions on resale. Privately issued securities are generally not traded on established markets. As a result of the absence of a public trading
market, privately issued securities may be deemed to be illiquid investments, may be more difficult to value than publicly traded securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations in value. Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result
in a loss to the Fund.</font></div> <div>Reinvestment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in short-term fixed-income instruments and, as a result, may be adversely affected if interest rates fall because it
may have to invest in lower-yielding instruments as bonds in the Fund's portfolio mature.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur
because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at
the local market close and the Fund's</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV),
transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried
out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased
market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days
or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The bar chart and table that follow show how the Fund has
performed on a calendar year basis and provide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Both assume that all dividends and distributions have been reinvested in the Fund. Past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Supplemental information about the Fund’s performance is shown under the heading <font>Total Return Information</font> in the
<font>Supplemental Information</font> section of the Prospectus. If BFA had not waived certain Fund fees during certain periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower.</div>

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
