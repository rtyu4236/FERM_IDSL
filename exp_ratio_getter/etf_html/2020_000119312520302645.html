Strategies” shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Dow Jones
U.S. Real Estate Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the real estate sector of the U.S. equity market, as defined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”).
The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single issuer (as determined by SPDJI) to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of
the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the
Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.50% of the index weight to maximum of 22.50%. Between
scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying </font></p>
