<div>The iShares Currency Hedged JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of broad-based Japanese equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and
Expenses are not included in the calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the
investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund's
investment in the iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF (“JPXN” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by JPXN through July 31, 2025. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to July 31, 2025 only
upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may pay
other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate
for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 8% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return USD Hedged Index (the “Underlying Index”), which provides exposure to broad-based Japanese equities with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying
Index hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index includes large-, mid- or small-capitalization companies and may change over time. As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by</div>

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities of companies in the consumer durables industry or sector. The
components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective
by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected
are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>components of the applicable underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (i.e., depositary receipts representing securities of the
Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the
Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments
not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The impact of the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index is calculated by assuming the sale of one-month currency forward contracts at the end of each month. The aggregate notional amount of currency forwards used to calculate the impact of the “hedging” component on index
return equals the total value of index constituent securities that trade in each underlying non-USD currency at the end of each month, and is not adjusted intra-month based on movements in the value of the constituent equity securities. The
Underlying Index may therefore be slightly “over-hedged” (if security values decline) or “under-hedged” (if security values increase) between month-end index rebalances.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>In order to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund enters into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese yen. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a
specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund’s exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the Japanese yen. While this approach is designed to minimize the
impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the Japanese yen. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between
the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.</div> <div>The Fund may also
use non-deliverable forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the
contractually agreed upon exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Japan Exchange Group, Inc.
and Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (together, “JPX Group”) and Nikkei Inc. (the “Nikkei”) (collectively, the “Index Provider”), which are independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the
composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and publishes</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any
particular risk factor.</div> <div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)

<div>Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment
for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There<font> </font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such
levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div> <div>Authorized
Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to
engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other
Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for
exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates.
Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>accurate assessment of included issuers.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset
class.</font></div> <div>Consumer Durables Industry Risk.<font> The consumer durables industry includes companies involved in the design, production, or distribution of household durables, leisure equipment and goods, textiles, luxury goods or apparel, each of
which may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. Companies in the consumer durables industry face intense
competition.</font></div> <div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs)
designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund). While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or
eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</div>
<div>Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and
unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the
Japanese yen may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund's currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra month. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the
Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the
U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates.
Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the Japanese yen may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the Japanese yen depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge
currency</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>exposure to the Japanese yen is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the
value of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen will reduce the value of a security denominated in the Japanese yen. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of
companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result,
investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and
without warning.</div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider
and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the
Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants,

<div>counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the
Underlying Fund invests.</div> <div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund’s or Underlying Fund's use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's returns or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a
currency, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may also be subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual
obligation. Counterparty risk for OTC derivatives is generally higher than that for derivatives traded on an exchange or through a clearing house. A risk of the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their
values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives
and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. The Fund could also suffer losses related to its
derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may
expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The impact of U.S. and global regulation of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund of
termination rights or remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), or may otherwise adversely</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>affect the value or performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in Japan, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in Japan, causing an adverse impact on the Underlying Fund's investments in
Japan.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged</font></div> </div>

<div>quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand,
layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on
the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result
in similar impacts.</div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund expects to invest a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the
Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a
direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the total annual fund operating expenses of the Underlying Fund change, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Lack of Natural Resources
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and Underlying Fund invest in Japan, which has few natural resources. Any fluctuation or shortage in the commodity markets could have a
negative impact on Japanese securities, which could reduce the possibility of appreciation or a positive impact on the currency, which in turn could reduce the benefit of the currency hedge entered into by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to
the Fund’s NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in

<div>creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO
THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange
on which the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be
greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to
the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets
may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically
exposed to <font>Asian Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in Japan, which is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an
adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through their holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Japan<font>.</font><font> The Japanese economy may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability, which could have a negative impact
on</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Japanese securities. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has
generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. In addition, Japan is subject to the risk of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, which could negatively
affect the Fund or the Underlying Fund. Japan’s relations with its neighbors have at times been strained, and strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards,
if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund's investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders
being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments composing the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal
income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income
the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. In addition, the
tax treatment of certain derivatives is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities (including shares of the Underlying Fund) and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s
price</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the
time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), transaction and hedging costs incurred and forward rates achieved by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other
distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index and the
cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange
markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its
currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the index value and determining the Fund's NAV. To the extent
that the Fund seeks its investment objective through investments in the Underlying Fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking error as compared to investing directly in the component securities of the Underlying Index. The potential for
increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by the Underlying Fund and
differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the currency</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>forward contracts (each valued as of the close of regular trading hours of the
New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the currency forward contracts
included in the Underlying Index (generally valued at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's
valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as
a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to
purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or
higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be
impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
