information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, the Summary Prospectus, Prospectus and SAI for the Fund. </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2">On March 19, 2014, in connection with the establishment of the Fund, the Board of Trustees of the Trust approved the planned liquidation, dissolution and termination of the Fund. As a result, the last day of
trading in the Fund on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) will be September 1, 2020. NYSE Arca will suspend trading in the Fund before the open of trading on September 2, 2020 and shares of the Fund will no longer be available for new
investments as of this date. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on September 4, 2020. The Fund’s final net asset value, as calculated on September 1, 2020, will include any costs associated
with the liquidation expected to be borne by the Fund. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Because shares of the Fund will not be traded on NYSE Arca during the period between
September 2, 2020 and September 4, 2020, we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your shares. Further, during this period, the Fund will be in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio, which may result
in the Fund not being able to track its Underlying Index (by September 2, 2020, the Underlying Index value will be represented almost entirely by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying Index). After September 1, 2020,
shareholders that remain invested in the Fund will receive the entire amount of their pro rata share of the liquidation proceeds on or about September 4, 2020, subject to their brokerage firm’s processes. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund prior to September 2, 2020 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the
sale of Fund shares. If you still hold shares of the Fund on September 4, 2020, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value as of the close of business on September 1, 2020, which will include any
dividends or distributions calculated as of that date. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you are subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for
you. A sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare tax exempt or taxable distributions
of its investment income and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain
or loss depending on your tax basis. Please refer to the “Taxes” disclosure beginning on page 66 of the SAI and consult your own tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of the Fund’s liquidation, including any state, local,
foreign or other tax consequences. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you have any questions, please call
