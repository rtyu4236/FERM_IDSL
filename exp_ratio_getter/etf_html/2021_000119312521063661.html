<div>The iShares Global Green Bond ETF (the “Fund”)
seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global investment-grade green bonds that are issued to fund environmental projects, while mitigating exposure to currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee such that the Fund’s
total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver will not exceed 0.20% through March 1, 2022. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to March 1, 2022 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 16% of the average value
of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal Investment
Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results
of the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Global Green Bond Select (USD Hedged) Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of global investment-grade (as determined by Bloomberg Index Services Limited, a subsidiary of Bloomberg
Barclays Capital, Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg Barclays”)) green bonds issued to fund projects with direct environmental benefits.</div>
<div>Green bonds are fixed income securities, the proceeds of which
are exclusively and formally applied to projects or activities that promote</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>climate or other environmental sustainability purposes. For inclusion in the
Underlying Index, securities are independently evaluated by MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”), pursuant to an agreement between MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg Index Services Limited (or an affiliate), based on four criteria
specified in the Green Bond Principles published by MSCI ESG Research (“Green Bond Principles”). The first criterion for bond eligibility in the Underlying Index is an evaluation of whether the use of proceeds falls within at least one
of six eligible environmental categories defined by MSCI ESG Research (<font>i.e.</font>, alternative energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water, green building, and climate adaption).
The remaining three criteria for evaluation and inclusion in the Underlying Index are the existence of processes for green project evaluation and selection, the existence of processes for management of proceeds, and the existence of a commitment to
ongoing reporting of the environmental impact.</div> <div>Both
self-labeled green bonds and unlabeled bonds are evaluated using these criteria for potential inclusion in the Underlying Index. So long as projects fall within an eligible MSCI ESG</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Research green bond category and there is sufficient transparency on the use
of proceeds, a bond is considered for the Underlying Index even if it is not explicitly marketed as a green bond. Meeting all four criteria is required for bonds issued after the publication of the Green Bond Principles in January 2014. Green bonds
issued prior to 2014 that are widely accepted by investors as green bonds may still qualify for the Underlying Index, even if not all four principles are satisfied, since no formal guidelines were available to issuers at the time of issuance.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes sovereign and government-related
debt, corporate bonds and securitized bonds denominated in currencies determined by the Index Provider from both developed and emerging market issuers. As of October 31, 2020, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities issued by entities in
the following 38 countries as well as securities issued or guaranteed by supranational entities: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K. and the U.S. As
of October 31, 2020, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by financials, sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations and non-U.S. agency debt securities. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over
time.</div> <div>The Underlying Index includes fixed-rate coupon
bonds and bonds that convert</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>from fixed to floating rate, including fixed-to-float perpetuals.
Fixed-to-floating rate bonds are eligible during their fixed-rate term only. Certain types of securities, such as bonds with equity type features (<font>e.g.</font>, warrants, convertibles, and preferreds),
inflation-linked bonds, floating-rate issues, fixed-rate perpetuals, tax-exempt municipal securities, private placements (other than those offered pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“1933 Act”)) and retail bonds, are excluded from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index will hold bonds until final maturity. As
of October 31, 2020, the weighted average duration of the securities in the Underlying Index was 8.21 years and the weighted average maturity of the securities in the Underlying Index was 9.20 years. The securities in the Underlying Index are
updated on the last business day of each month (the rebalancing date), and the currency risk of the securities in the Underlying Index is hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio</div>

<div>turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in
the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may
invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of
BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Components of the Underlying Index include fixed-income
securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and
non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the fixed-income portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
underlying non-U.S. dollar currencies at a one-month forward rate to hedge against fluctuations in the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying
Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies are weakening relative to the U.S. dollar and appreciation in some of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies does not
exceed the aggregate depreciation of the others. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies, on a net basis, are rising relative to the U.S.
dollar.</div> <div>In order to track the “hedging”
component of the Underlying Index, the Fund enters into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. A currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy
or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund’s exposure to foreign
currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate
the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. The return of the currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the non-U.S. dollar component currencies and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Barclays, MSCI
ESG Research, or their affiliates, which are independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value
of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S.
government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by
members of any industry.</div> <div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem
its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other
market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem,
Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that
invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset
class.</div> <div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Currency Hedging
Risk.<font> In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts
and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect
matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and
unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the
non-U.S. dollar component currencies may not be fully hedged at all times. At certain times, the Fund may use an optimized hedging strategy and will hedge a smaller number of non-U.S. dollar</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>component currencies to reduce hedging costs. Because currency forwards are
over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index
and the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, volatility in one or more of the currencies may offset stability in another currency and
reduce the overall effectiveness of the hedges. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and some or all of the
applicable foreign currency interest rates may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if one or more of the currencies of the non-U.S. markets in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar
and the depreciation of one currency is not offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the depreciating currency or currencies is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar against the non-U.S. dollar component currencies will reduce the value of a security denominated in such currencies, as</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>applicable. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates between currencies
could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a
result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly
and without warning.</div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market to fluctuate
significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may also be subject to counterparty</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not
fulfill its contractual obligation. Counterparty risk for OTC derivatives is generally higher than that for derivatives traded on an exchange or through a clearing house. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in
their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for
derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. The Fund could also suffer losses
related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives may give rise to a form of
leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. To the extent that the Fund invests in rolling futures contracts, it may be subject to additional risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation of derivatives may make
derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund of termination rights or remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), or
may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the
Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector
and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Green Bond Investment Strategy Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund’s investment strategy of investing in green bonds limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result,
the Fund may underperform other funds that do not have a green bond focus. The Fund’s green bond investment strategy may result in the Fund investing in securities or industry</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform other funds
with a green bond focus. In addition, projects funded by green bonds selected by the Index Provider may not result in direct environmental benefits.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund
reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid
investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in
the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near
maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its
exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and
corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the
Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify
interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and
detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have increased, the Fund
may have a very low, or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund
to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund. The historically low interest rate environment heightens the
risks associated with rising interest rates.</div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund has exposure.The Fund may be adversely
affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other
instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or
global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or
discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses
due to ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may
depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.<font> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by foreign government agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities
are generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the entity issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full
faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to provide that support. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and
other policies.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the
possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. The
Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be
inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk and North American Economic
Risk.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.
In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in France. <font>The Fund’s investment in French issuers subjects the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to France. Recently, new concerns emerged with respect to
the economic outlook for certain European Union (the “EU”) countries, including France. External demand for French exports is expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K. resolution to leave the EU. As a result, the French economy may
experience adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn, potential weakness in exports, high rates of unemployment and rising government debt levels. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports, and as a result, is
susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products. France has experienced several terrorist attacks over the past several years, creating a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory, currency and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves
risks associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the
U.S., Canada and the EU, have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign
governments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing
restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government or Russian companies, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Sovereign and
Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk. <font>The Fund invests in securities issued by or guaranteed by non-U.S. sovereign governments and by entities affiliated with or backed by non-U.S. sovereign
governments, which may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt
obligations.</font></div> <div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and
taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger
portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain
derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>As part of the Fund's currency hedging strategy, the Fund may
match currency forward contracts with the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities whose currency risk is intended to be hedged wholly or partially by such contracts. If the Fund were to perform such matching for income tax purposes, this matching
would potentially result in the Fund’s deferral for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the realized gains or losses attributable to foreign currency forward contracts until such gains or losses offset the currency-related losses on the
matched non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. If the IRS were to disagree with such deferral treatment or the matching methodology used, the Fund's income could become undistributed and incur tax liabilities. The Fund may reevaluate, adjust,
begin, or discontinue the matching of such contracts in the future.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market
close and the Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), transaction and hedging costs incurred and forward rates achieved by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing
of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance
of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market
conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions
during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR
INDEX ETFS.</div> <div>Valuation

when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The
Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial

a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
