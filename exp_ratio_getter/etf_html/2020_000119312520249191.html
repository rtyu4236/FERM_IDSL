momentum characteristics from the MSCI USA Index and includes U.S. large- and <font>mid-capitalization</font> stocks, as defined by MSCI. The Parent Index and Underlying Index are each designed to measure the performance
of an equity momentum strategy by emphasizing stocks with high price momentum, while maintaining reasonably high trading liquidity, investment capacity and moderate index turnover, each as determined by the Index Provider. The Underlying Index aims
to reflect the performance of the Parent Index, with all constituent changes of the Parent Index distributed over multiple days leading into the rebalancing effective date with an aim of facilitating easier implementation of the changes resulting
from the rebalancing. </font></p>

each individual issuer is capped at 5%. MSCI uses an algorithm to determine the number of components in the Parent Index based on the number of constituents in the MSCI USA Index. The number of components of the Underlying Index and Parent Index are
evaluated semi-annually. After the constituent changes for the Parent Index are determined at each rebalancing, the Index Provider distributes the changes over three days for the Underlying Index leading into the rebalancing effective date. As of
July 31, 2019, there were 124 securities in the Underlying Index. As of July 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the technology industry or sector. The components of the
Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes”

Description.</b> The MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index consists of stocks exhibiting relatively higher momentum characteristics than the MSCI USA Index, as determined by MSCI Inc. The MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index is a version of the MSCI
USA Momentum Index (the “Parent Index”), which is constructed by staggering the changes in securities’ number of shares due to rebalancing, in equal proportion over three days: <font>T-2,</font> <font>T-1</font> and T (where T, is the effective date of the rebalancing of Parent Index). </font></p> <p><font size="2">A risk-adjusted price momentum, defined
by MSCI as the excess return over the risk-free rate divided by the annualized standard deviation of weekly returns over the past <font>3-years,</font> is calculated for each security in the MSCI USA Index over <font>6-</font> and <font>12-month</font> time periods. The <font>6-</font> and </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
<font>12-month</font> risk-adjusted price momentum calculations are then standardized at <font>+/-3</font> standard deviations and
translated into an average momentum score. A fixed number of securities with the highest positive momentum scores are predetermined for the Parent Index at initial construction with an aim to attain a high exposure to the momentum factor while
maintaining sufficient market capitalization and number of securities coverages. The weight of each Parent Index constituent is determined based on the product of the security’s momentum score and its market capitalization weight in the MSCI
USA Index and further adjusted to, among others, mitigate the impact of stock-specific risk. Additionally, each individual issuer is capped at 5%. The Parent Index and Underlying Index are evaluated semi-annually. After the constituent changes for
the Parent Index are determined at each rebalancing, the Index Provider distributes the changes over three days for the Underlying Index leading into the rebalancing effective date. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Calculation Methodology.</b> The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with gross dividends reinvested. The use of gross dividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of the entire dividend distributed to
holders of the underlying stock, without any adjustment for taxes or withholding. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you have any questions, please call
