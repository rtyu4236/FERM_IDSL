<div>The iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that are rated either investment-grade or high yield.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates,
through February 29, 2024. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to February 29, 2024 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those
periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 253% of the average
value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal Investment
Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results
of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated taxable bonds that are rated either investment-grade or high yield (as determined by Bloomberg Index
Services Limited (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg”)). The Underlying Index includes U.S. Treasury bonds, government-related bonds (<font>i.e.</font>, U.S. and non-U.S. agencies, sovereign,
quasi-sovereign, supranational and local authority debt), investment-grade and high yield U.S. corporate bonds,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“MBS”), commercial
mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, Eurodollar bonds, bonds registered with the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of issuance or offered pursuant to Rule 144A with or without registration rights and U.S. dollar-denominated
emerging market bonds.</div> <div>The securities in the Underlying
Index must be denominated in U.S. dollars. The Underlying Index was comprised of 113 countries or regions as of October 31, 2018. As of October 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by corporate bonds of companies in
the industrials sector or industry and mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury bonds. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower
costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and
yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates
(“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at
least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as
in</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will
help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”),</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment
objective.</div> <div>Agency Debt Risk. <font>The Fund invests in unsecured bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, including the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). Bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, government-sponsored entities, or government corporations, including, among others, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are generally backed only by the general
creditworthiness and reputation of the U.S. government agency, government-sponsored entity, or government corporation issuing the bond or debenture and are not guaranteed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”) or backed
by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the current status of many obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other agencies that are under conservatorship of the U.S. government. Government
National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) securities are generally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</font></div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized
Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or</font></div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>counterparty's financial condition and on the terms of an obligation.</div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, and other service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers
of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the
Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.<font> High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other
transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities.</font></div>
<div>High Yield Securities Risk. <font>Securities that are rated below investment-grade (commonly referred to as “junk bonds,”</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>which may include those bonds rated below “BBB-” by S&amp;P Global
Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) or “Baa3” by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”)), or are unrated, may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated securities of
similar maturity and may be more likely to default.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund
reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid
investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity
or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data,</font></div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance
with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of
certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font>The Fund invests in MBS, some of which may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. MBS are subject to prepayment or call risk and extension risk. Because of these risks, MBS
react differently than other bonds to changes in interest rates. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain MBS. Default or bankruptcy of a counterparty to a
to-be-announced (“TBA”) transaction would expose the Fund to possible loss.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions,
including declining markets.</div> <div>Prepayment Risk.<font> During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with
lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential.</font></div>
<div>Privately-Issued Securities Risk. <font>The Fund may invest in privately-issued securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“1933 Act”). Privately-issued securities are securities that have not been registered under the 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to legal restrictions on resale. Privately-issued securities are generally not traded on established
markets. As a result of the absence of a public trading market, privately issued securities may be deemed to be illiquid investments, may be more difficult to value than publicly traded securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations in value.
Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves risks
associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the U.S.,
Canada</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions
on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. These and future sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may adversely affect Russia’s economy and the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur
because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at
the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), differences in transaction costs, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution
of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual
market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. <font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics and may provide relatively lower returns than those of other
securities. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other
asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons.
In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund
shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology.
The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> </div>

those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an
“ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares
trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 100,000 shares or multiples thereof
(“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash)
that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
