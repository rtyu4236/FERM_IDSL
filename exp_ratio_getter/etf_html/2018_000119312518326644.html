<div>The iShares Global Green Bond ETF (the “Fund”)
seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global investment-grade green bonds that are issued to fund environmental projects, while mitigating exposure to currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee in order to limit the Fund’s total
annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver to 0.20% through March 1, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to March 1, 2020 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Bloomberg
Barclays MSCI Global Green Bond Select (USD Hedged) Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of global investment-grade (as determined by Bloomberg Index Services Limited, a subsidiary of Bloomberg Barclays Capital,
Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg Barclays”)) green bonds issued to fund projects with direct environmental benefits.</div>
<div>Green bonds are fixed income securities the proceeds of which
are exclusively and formally applied to projects or activities that promote climate or other environmental sustainability purposes. For inclusion in the Underlying Index, securities are independently evaluated</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>by MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”), pursuant to an
agreement between MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg Index Services Limited (or an affiliate) based on four criteria specified in the Green Bond Principles published by MSCI ESG Research (“Green Bond Principles”). The first criterion for
bond eligibility in the Underlying Index is an evaluation of whether the use of proceeds falls within at least one of six eligible environmental categories defined by MSCI ESG Research (<font>i.e.</font>, alternative
energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water, green building, and climate adaption). The remaining three criteria for evaluation and inclusion in the Underlying Index are the existence of processes for green project
evaluation and selection, the existence of processes for management of proceeds, and the existence of a commitment to ongoing reporting of the environmental impact.</div>
<div>Both self-labeled green bonds and unlabeled bonds are evaluated
using these criteria for potential inclusion in the Underlying Index. So long as projects fall within an eligible MSCI ESG Research green bond category and there is sufficient transparency on the use of proceeds, a bond is considered for the
Underlying Index even if it is not</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>explicitly marketed as a green bond. Meeting all four criteria is required for
bonds issued after the publication of the Green Bond Principles in January 2014. Green bonds issued prior to 2014 that are widely accepted by investors as green bonds may still qualify for the Underlying Index, even if not all four principles are
satisfied, since no formal guidelines were available to issuers at the time of issuance.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes sovereign and government-related
debt, corporate bonds and securitized bonds denominated in currencies determined by the Index Provider from both developed and emerging market issuers. As of September 28, 2018, the Underlying Index was comprised of securities issued by entities in
the following 28 countries as well as securities issued or guaranteed by supranational entities: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Lithuania,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S. As of September 28, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by
non-U.S. government sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations, non-U.S. agency debt securities, and debt securities of companies in the financials sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes fixed-rate coupon bonds and bonds
that convert from fixed to floating rate, including fixed-to-float perpetuals. Fixed-to-floating rate bonds are eligible during their fixed-rate term only. Certain types</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>of securities, such as bonds with equity type features (<font>e.g.</font>, warrants, convertibles, and preferreds), inflation-linked bonds, floating-rate issues, fixed-rate perpetuals, tax-exempt municipal securities, private placements (other than those offered pursuant to Rule
144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”)) and retail bonds, are excluded from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index does not have a one year minimum time to
maturity requirement and will hold bonds until final maturity. As of September 28, 2018, the weighted average duration of the securities in the Underlying Index was 7.05 years and the weighted average maturity of the securities in the Underlying
Index was 8.34 years. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month (the rebalancing date), and the currency risk of the securities in the Underlying Index is hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly
basis.</div> <div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear
overvalued.</div> <div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the
Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in
the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may
invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of
BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Components of the Underlying Index include fixed-income
securities and</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable)
designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the
fixed-income portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
underlying non-U.S. dollar currencies at a one-month forward rate to hedge against fluctuations in the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying
Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies are weakening relative to the U.S. dollar and appreciation in some of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies does not
exceed the aggregate depreciation of the others. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies, on a net basis, are rising relative to the U.S.
dollar.</div> <div>In order to track the “hedging”
component of the Underlying Index, the Fund enters into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two
parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund’s exposure to</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the
Fund to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component
currencies. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the non-U.S. dollar component currencies and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Barclays, MSCI
ESG Research, or their affiliates, which are independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and
instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers or securities, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor
BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers or securities.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</div>
<div>Cash Transactions Risk<font>. </font><font>The Fund expects to effect its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, the Fund may have to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times in order to obtain the
cash needed to meet redemption orders. This may cause the Fund to sell a security and recognize a capital gain or loss that might not have been incurred if it had made a redemption in-kind. The use of cash creations and redemptions may also cause
the Fund’s shares to trade in the market at wider bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project types, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial
condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>position that the Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally
should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its
reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</div>
<div>In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the
Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio. NDFs may
be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts and require the Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for the Fund. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund being
unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying
currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both
global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund invests. In</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the
Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies may not be fully hedged at all times. At certain times, the Fund may use an optimized hedging strategy and will hedge a smaller number of non-U.S. dollar component currencies to
reduce hedging costs. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible
that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce
the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund
enters into. Currency hedging activity exposes the Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index
and the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition, volatility in</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>one or more of the currencies may offset stability in another currency and
reduce the overall effectiveness of the hedges. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and some or all of the
applicable foreign currency interest rates may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if one or more of the currencies of the non-U.S. markets in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar
and the depreciation of one currency is not offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the depreciating currency or currencies is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar against the non-U.S. dollar component currencies will reduce the value of a security denominated in such currencies, as applicable. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates between currencies could affect the economy or particular
business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for
losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>distributor, and other service providers, the Index Provider, market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market to fluctuate
significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may also be subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. Counterparty risk for OTC derivatives is
generally higher than that for derivatives traded on an exchange or through a clearing house. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the underlying asset,
the performance of the asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a
derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. The Fund
could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives may give
rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. To the extent that the Fund invests in rolling futures contracts, it may be subject to additional risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation of
derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund of termination rights or remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could
result in losses), or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be
predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Green Bond Investment Strategy Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund’s investment strategy of investing in green bonds limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result,
the Fund may underperform other funds that do not have a green bond focus. The Fund’s green bond investment strategy may result in the Fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform
other funds with a green bond focus. In addition, projects funded by green bonds selected by the Index Provider may not result in direct environmental benefits.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity
or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</div> <div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and
may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of
those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk<font>.</font><font> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. This can reduce the Fund's returns because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or
prices.</font></div> <div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index,</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the
intended results.</div> <div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to ineffective currency hedges,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is
open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may
depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.<font> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by foreign government
agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the entity issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign
government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to provide that support. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by
the foreign government’s economic and other policies.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the
possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. The
Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service
providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address
every possible risk and may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk and North American Economic
Risk.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.
In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</font></div> </div>

<div>Risk of Investing in France. <font>The Fund’s investment in French issuers subjects the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to France. Recently, new concerns emerged with respect to
the economic outlook for certain European Union (the “EU”) countries, including France. External demand for French exports is expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K. resolution to leave the EU. As a result, the French economy may
experience adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn, potential weakness in exports, high rates of unemployment and rising government debt levels. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the
independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the French economy. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports, and as a result, is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products. France has experienced
several terrorist attacks over the past several years, creating a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund
does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange.</div>
<div>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk. <font>The Fund invests in securities issued by or guaranteed by non-U.S. sovereign governments and by entities affiliated with or backed by non-U.S. sovereign governments, which may be unable or unwilling to
repay principal or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Supranational Entities Risk.<font> The Fund invests in obligations issued or guaranteed by supranational entities (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the World Bank,
European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asia Development Bank), which may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. The government members, or “stockholders,” usually make initial capital
contributions to the supranational entity and, in many cases, are committed to make additional capital contributions if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of the supranational entity
will continue to make any necessary additional capital contributions. If such contributions are not made, the entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, the Fund may have limited legal recourse in

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>event of default, and the Fund may lose money on such investments.</div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and
taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than
as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an
increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation,
regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</font></div>
<div>As part of the Fund's currency hedging strategy, the Fund may
match currency forward contracts with the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities whose currency risk is intended to be hedged wholly or partially by such contracts. If the Fund were to perform such matching for income tax purposes, this matching
would potentially result in the Fund’s deferral for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the realized gains or losses attributable to foreign currency forward contracts until such gains or losses offset the currency-related losses on the
matched non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. If the IRS were</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>to disagree with such deferral treatment or the matching methodology used, the
Fund's income could become undistributed and incur tax liabilities. The Fund may reevaluate, adjust, begin, or discontinue the matching of such contracts in the future.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the
Fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of
or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying
Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign
exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust
its currency hedges, whereas the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-13</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. BFA EXPECTS
THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFS.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from
the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In
addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who
purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a
different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>

Fund Shares</div> <div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the
Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV,
shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to
Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a specified amount of cash.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when

a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
