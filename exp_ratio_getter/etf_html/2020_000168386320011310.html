<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the
        fees and expenses that you will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the
        “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and
        disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and

<div>
<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
        transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
        performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 5% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
        investment results of the S&amp;P 500 (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC
        (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”). As of March 31, 2019, the Underlying Index included approximately 80% of the market capitalization of all publicly-traded U.S. equity securities. The
        securities in the Underlying Index are weighted based on the float-adjusted market value of their outstanding shares. The Underlying Index consists of securities from a broad range of industries. As of March 31, 2019,
        a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the information technology industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
        indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
        positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
        that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
        performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
        indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
        to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings),
        fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying
        Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally invests at least
        90% of its assets in securities of the Underlying Index and in depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap
        contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund
        track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities
        representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of
        SPDJI which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market
        value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this
        limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any
        industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
        lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may
        adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the
        significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial
        market or other asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of
        institutions that may act as</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Authorized Participants on an agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to
        the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole,
        to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset
        class.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
        Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems.
        Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the
        Fund invests.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common
        stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt
        securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
        investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index.
        Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a
        period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying
        Index to vary from its normal or expected condition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged
        quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme
        volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>will have an impact on the Fund and its investments
        and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future
        may result in similar impacts.</div>
<div>Information Technology Sector
        Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and
        may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for
        their products and services and actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or services.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an
        issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies
        Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more
        mature and subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance
        of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
        events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
        increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
        volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
        Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
        procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities to which
        the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return
        the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with
        cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
        differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s
        holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize
        the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times
        of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>

<td>After-tax returns in the table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns
                    depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as
                    401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same
                    character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each
        Portfolio Manager supervises a portfolio management team. Ms. Aguirre, Ms. Hsui, Mr. Mason, Mr. Savage and Ms. Whitelaw have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since 2018, 2012, 2016, 2008 and 2018,
        respectively.</font></div>
<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund
        (commonly referred to as an “ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of
        Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue
        or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The
        Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
        distributions that may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally
        will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
        Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
        through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
        intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.</div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important
        information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the
        Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other
        publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other
        instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or
        redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and
        trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular
        segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation
        strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons,
        including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying
        Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index
        Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index
        performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment
        will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the
        divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing
        strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the</div>

<div>securities in its underlying index in approximately
        the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under continuous listing standards
        adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying
        Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index,
        or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a
        bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and
        the Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund is subject to various
        risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of
        your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries,
        groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in
        comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and
        governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
        Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
        and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
        delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent
        that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected

<div>
<div>underperformance of those securities, may
        experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are
        susceptible to operational, information security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities
        in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks
        faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining
        unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
        Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those
        from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by or
        breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and
        administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial
        losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption
        orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation
        costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund
        inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the
        event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyberattacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention
        and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers
        in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>

<div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations
        that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders
        to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider.
        There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately.
        While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality,
        accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described
        in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any
        agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index
        Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For
        example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other
        constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the
        Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause
        the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility
        could mean that constituents that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the
        Underlying Index to vary from those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to
        reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn
        rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be
        borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad</div>

        adversely affected the economies of many nations and the global economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be
        predicted with certainty. Any market or economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>

                    activity to the extent a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund invests in short-term instruments that
                    have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be impaired as a result. Certain issuers of equity securities have cancelled or announced the suspension of dividends. The outbreak has, and may continue to, negatively
                    affect the credit ratings of some fixed income securities and their issuers.</font>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks
        that may arise in the future could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div>
<div>Information Technology Sector
        Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies,
        information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological
        developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on
        patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its
        securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages,
        corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may
        also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts
        operations.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies
        Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject
        to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader
        securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a
        result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may
        decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,
        exchange, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries,</font></div>

<div>sector or asset class. Local, regional or global
        events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
        increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the
        same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by
        market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
        available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange
        or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in
        others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who
        trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less
        efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with
        more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund
        shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by
        extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to
        shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at
        Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates
        with changes in the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares
        and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or</font></div>

<div>
<div>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the
        Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. <font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV,
        BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and
        sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s
        next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and
        redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that
        differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute
        to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund
        Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will
        likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the
        “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market
        liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider
        spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly
        from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s
        service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures.
        However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative
        of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on
        U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as
        on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S. public debt level or the imposition of U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which the
        Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly
        strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries continue to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The
        U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in
        a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral.
        These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of
        substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
        between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of
        uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the
        distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of
        increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to
        certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial
        Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to
        include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency</font></div>

<div>forwards and other derivatives as well as
        repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution
        proceedings and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the
        Fund.</div>
<div>Communication Services Sector
        Risk.<font> The communication services sector consists of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in
        the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a
        variety of services and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review websites and Internet search engines.</font></div>
<div>The communication services sector of
        a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new
        regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary
        and unpredictable. Companies in the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new
        products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</div>
<div>The domestic telecommunications
        market is characterized by increasing competition and regulation by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and various state regulatory authorities. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain
        franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited
        availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other
        negative effects in the future.</div>
<div>Companies in the media and
        entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a
        potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in state and federal government regulation. Companies in the media and
        entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases
        and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector
        Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition,
        consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected
        by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy,
        consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by
        changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Energy Sector Risk. <font>The success of companies in</font> <font>the energy sector may be cyclical and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among
        others: changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange rates, interest rates, economic
        conditions, and tax treatment; and energy conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed
        pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a relatively small number of customers,
        including governmental entities and utilities. As a result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or
        engage in, transactions involving countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies also face a significant risk of liability
        from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, political strife or
        natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy
        companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may have relatively high
        levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the
        prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must</font></div>

<div>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent
        to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
        consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain
        U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials
        sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks
        may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage.
        Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse
        conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials
        sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks
        and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government
        reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in
        technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may
        be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are
        subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price
        discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful.
        Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S.
        Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the</font></div>

        the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market
        participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market
        and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of
        market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held
        by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily
        seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the
        Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to
        liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During
        periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the
        Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials
        sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes and changes in
        government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability
        for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the
        industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government
        demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or
        actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may
        be</font></div>

        capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s
        portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</div>
<div>For example, in certain
        circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership
        restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts
        and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client
        accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's
        policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be
        found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment
        of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's
        investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive
        resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory
        Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with
        respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary
        expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust).</div>
<div>Effective June 25, 2020, for its
        investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.03%. Prior to June 25, 2020 and for the
        fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.04%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily

<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street,
        San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2019, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess
        of $6.84 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for
        the approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's semi-annual report for the period ended September 30.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for
        various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of his or her portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes,
        implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his or her portfolio management team that have more limited responsibilities.</font></div>
<div>Rachel Aguirre has been with
        BlackRock since 2006, including her years with Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”), which merged with BlackRock in 2009. Ms. Aguirre has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since
        2006 and has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2018.</div>
<div>Jennifer Hsui has been employed by
        BFA or its affiliates as a senior portfolio manager since 2007. Prior to that, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio manager from 2006 to 2007 for Barclays Global Fund Advisors (“BGFA”). Ms. Hsui has been a Portfolio
        Manager of the Fund since 2012.</div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which,
        through a subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”),
        and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund
        and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA,
        its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their
        interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager,
        commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect
        interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with
        and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other
        services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships
        or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity
        provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which
        an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to,
        distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to
        Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives
        similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by
        other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
        “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or
        an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</font></div>

<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate
        is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's
        investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more
        Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>In addition, the Fund may, from time
        to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by
        clients advised or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees,
        may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited
        because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program
        approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the
        securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as
        collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its
        Affiliates and Entities and their respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and
        procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</div>

<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a
        Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a

<div>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
        otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IVV.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an
        exchange or other secondary market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other
        charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the
        “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally
        lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The
        Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the
        underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of
        not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change
        in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market
        timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national
        securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on
        which the Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.
        Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
        restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the
        limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares
        of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust, the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment
        companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of,
        and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>

<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund
        are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
        companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of
        stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC
        and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form.</div>
<div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand
        for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized
        portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other
        information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the
        precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be
        viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from
        broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such
        holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value.
        <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
        (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
        dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced
        closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and
        other assets and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>

<div>value, which is generally determined using the last
        reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S.
        securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
        securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not
        readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the
        Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market
        quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event
        subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant
        event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to
        the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith
        approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost
        to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be
        the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference
        between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the
        Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are
        declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is
        necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on
        shares of the Fund are distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds
        received from the Fund.</div>

<div>
<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for
        reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require
        beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole
        shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on
        current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in Fund
        shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax
        consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div>
<div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of
        the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain
        dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at
        long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income
        exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of
        U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend
        income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.
        corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends
        received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for
        benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S.
        securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from
        a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income</div>

<div>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected
        that dividends received by the Fund from a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years
        beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the
        Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as
        qualified dividend income, the dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days
        during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the
        181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent
        attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are
        subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions
        exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the
        Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. The Fund’s
        capital loss carryforwards, if any, carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. A return of capital
        distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are
        sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a
        citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term
        capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S.
        shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is
        currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S.
        Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To
        avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification
        numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
        maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information
        concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder
        information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain
        exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out
        pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen
        of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required
        certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital
        gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as
        long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in
        “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</font></div>
<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes
        some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and
        sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000
        shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the
        “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is
        subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for
        which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings</div>

<div>
<div>of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of
        Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for
        cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed
        only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and
        redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may
        create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or
        other interruption, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed
        at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</div>
<div>To the extent the Fund engages in
        in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any
        securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933
        Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities
        eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be
        made through a firm that is either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect
        to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption
        orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created
        and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some
        activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery
        and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that
        dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold
        allotment” within the meaning of</div>

        available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and
        Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation
        Units. The standard creation and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant
        creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged
        to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable
        business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified) are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the
        table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based
        on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such services.</font></div>
<div>The following table shows, as of
        April 30, 2019, the approximate value of one Creation Unit, standard fees and maximum additional charges for creations and redemptions (as described above and in the Fund's SAI):</div>

<div>The Distributor or its agent
        distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the
        securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments
        to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain
        investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or
        indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options
        it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial
        incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other iShares funds over another
        investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in
        accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest
        bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or
        below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and
        demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the
        differences (expressed as a percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported
        NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the
        frequency of distributions of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2018 and the first two calendar quarters of 2019.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the
        number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also
        shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the total returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total
        Returns” represents the average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods
        indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of
        one share of the Fund as calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the
        Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the
        Fund's NAV is calculated. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of
        securities and therefore does not incur the expenses incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that
        may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
        would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth
        more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future results.</div>
<div>Performance as of March 31, 2019</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
        transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
        performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 17% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
        investment results of the S&amp;P MidCap 400 (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the mid-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices
        LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”). As of March 31, 2019, the Underlying Index included approximately 7% of the market capitalization of all publicly-traded U.S. equity securities. The
        securities in the Underlying Index are weighted based on the float-adjusted market value of their outstanding shares, and have, as of March 31, 2019, a market capitalization between $2.4 billion and $8.2 billion at
        the time of inclusion in the Underlying Index, which may fluctuate depending on the overall level of the equity markets. The securities are selected by SPDJI based on the Index Provider's liquidity measures. The
        Underlying Index consists of securities from a broad range of industries. As of March 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials, industrials
        and information technology industries or sectors. The</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>components of the Underlying Index are likely to
        change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
        indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
        positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
        that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
        performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
        indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
        to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings),
        fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying
        Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally invests at least
        90% of its assets in securities of the Underlying Index and in depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap
        contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help</div>

<div>the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks
        to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities
        representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of
        SPDJI which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market
        value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this
        limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any
        industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
        lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may
        adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the
        significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>markets, a particular financial market or other
        asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of
        institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
        respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole,
        to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset
        class.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
        Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking</font></div>

<div>
<div>to address system breaches or failures, there are
        inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common
        stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt
        securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic
        conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is
        limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent
        years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the
        Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
        investment objective. Market</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have
        an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index
        in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
        shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected condition.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for
        environmental damage or product liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged
        quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme
        volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or
        cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>

        among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or services.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an
        issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
        events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
        increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
        volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
        Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition, the securities of
        mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
        Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
        procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities to which
        the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return
        the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with
        cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>

<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
        differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s
        holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-</font></div>

<td>After-tax returns in the table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns

        Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue
        or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The
        Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
        distributions that may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally
        will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
        Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
        through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
        intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.</div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important
        information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the
        Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other
        publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other
        instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or
        redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and
        trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular
        segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation
        strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons,
        including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying
        Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index
        Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index
        performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment
        will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the
        divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing
        strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the</div>

<div>securities in its underlying index in approximately
        the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under continuous listing standards
        adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying
        Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index,
        or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a
        bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and
        the Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund is subject to various
        risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of
        your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries,
        groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in
        comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and
        governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
        Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
        and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
        delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent
        that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected
        by the</font></div>

<div>
<div>underperformance of those securities, may
        experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are
        susceptible to operational, information security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities
        in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks
        faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining
        unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
        Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those
        from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by or
        breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and
        administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial
        losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption
        orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation
        costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund
        inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the
        event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyberattacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention
        and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers
        in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations
        that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders
        to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the
        prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited
        by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently
        enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector,
        increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various
        countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of
        investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
        interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject
        to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is
        also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and
        have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider.
        There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately.
        While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality,
        accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described
        in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider</font></div>

<div>
<div>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or
        guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and
        may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or
        positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be
        underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting
        from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause
        the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility
        could mean that constituents that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the
        Underlying Index to vary from those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to
        reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn
        rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be
        borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking
        error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials
        sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes and changes in
        government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability
        for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the
        industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government
        demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has

                    activity to the extent a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund invests in short-term instruments that
                    have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be impaired as a result. Certain issuers of equity securities have cancelled or announced the suspension of dividends. The outbreak has, and may continue to, negatively

                    resumption of trading will occur or, once such markets resume trading, whether they will face further closures. Any suspension of trading in markets in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its

                    ability of employees of the Fund’s service providers to perform critical tasks relating to the Fund, for example, due to the service providers’ employees performing tasks in alternate locations than under

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks
        that may arise in the future could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div>
<div>Information Technology Sector
        Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies,
        information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological
        developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on
        patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its
        securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages,
        corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may
        also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts
        operations.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a
        result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may
        decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,
        exchange, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other
        public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market
        downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>

<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by
        market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
        available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange
        or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in
        others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who
        trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less
        efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with
        more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund
        shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by
        extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to
        shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at
        Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates
        with changes in the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares
        and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the
        long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,</font></div>

<div>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature
        is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly
        with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or
        other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing
        to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund
        Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will
        likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the
        “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market
        liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider
        spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly
        from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.
        <font>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those
        of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization
        companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell
        shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related
        to their products.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s
        service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures.
        However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative
        of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on
        U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as
        on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S. public debt level or the imposition of U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which the
        Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly
        strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries continue to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The
        U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in
        a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral.
        These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of
        substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
        between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of
        uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the
        distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of
        increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Other
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to
        certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial
        Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to
        include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other
        derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is
        subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and
        other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector
        Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition,
        consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected
        by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government
        reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in
        technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may
        be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are
        subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price
        discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful.
        Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S.
        Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or
        disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments
        may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at</font></div>

<div>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be
        illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or instruments.
        To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid
        investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will
        continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program.
        Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at
        reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where
        redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments
        in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in
        the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls, increased competition,
        depletion of resources, technical advances, labor relations, over-production, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for
        environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</font></div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font> The Fund may invest in companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) or real estate
        holding and operating companies, which expose investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated.
        Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize
        leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could
        result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices
        for REITs and for properties held by such REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such
        expenses.</font></div>

        </a>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or property type. Economic downturns affecting a
        particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div>
<div>Equity REITs Risk. <font>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These REITs are often referred to as “Equity REITs.” Equity REITs invest primarily in real properties and may earn
        rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in
        the value of the properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from other properties or poor
        management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices
        for such REITs and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate projects are dependent
        upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment
        obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect
        a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company
        to operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk<font>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities may be volatile. There may
        be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In
        addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to changes in economic or other
        conditions.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects
        its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash
        flow dependency, default by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real
        Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be
        limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant
        bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real
        estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts, changing tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural,
        technological, global or local economic developments and changes in tax law.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk<font>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, reduced
        funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate income and values.</font></div>
<div>Repayment Risk.<font> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to obtain financing either on favorable
        terms or at all. If the properties in which Real Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant
        improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and principal on their loans will be adversely
        affected.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Tax Risk. <font>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income
        taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its
        shareholders may result in the REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including
        excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or
        actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be
        restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make</font></div>

<div>
<div>investments in certain securities may be affected
        by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This
        may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</div>
<div>For example, in certain
        circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership
        restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts
        and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client
        accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> Deregulation may subject utility companies to greater competition and may adversely affect their profitability. As deregulation allows utility companies to diversify outside of their
        original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. In addition, deregulation may eliminate restrictions on the profits of certain utility companies,
        but may also subject these companies to greater risk of loss. Companies in the utilities industry may have difficulty obtaining an adequate return on invested capital, raising capital, or financing large construction
        projects during periods of inflation or unsettled capital markets; face restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations and regulation; find that existing plants,
        equipment or products have been rendered obsolete by technological innovations; or be subject to increased costs because of the scarcity of certain fuels or the effects of man-made or natural disasters. Existing and
        future regulations or legislation may make it difficult for utility companies to operate profitably. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. There
        is no assurance that regulatory authorities will grant rate increases in the future or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks issued by a utility company. Energy conservation
        and changes in climate policy may also have a significant adverse impact on the revenues and expenses of utility companies.</font></div>

<div>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and
        expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other
        investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory
        Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with
        respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary
        expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust).</div>
<div>Effective June 25, 2020, for its

        effective December 13, 2019, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.06%. Prior to December 13, 2019 and for the fiscal
        year ended March 31, 2019, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.07%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive
        and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any
        time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street,
        San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2019, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess
        of $6.84 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for
        the approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's semi-annual report for the period ended September 30.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for
        various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of his or her portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes,
        implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his or her portfolio management team that have more limited responsibilities.</font></div>
<div>Rachel Aguirre has been with
        BlackRock since 2006, including her years with Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”), which merged with BlackRock in 2009. Ms. Aguirre has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since
        2006 and has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2018.</div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which,
        through a subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”),
        and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund
        and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA,
        its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their
        interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager,
        commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect
        interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with

<div>Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or
        equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating
        to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide
        research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who
        engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment
        transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete
        for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may
        include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and
        these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are
        senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate
        is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's
        investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more
        Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>In addition, the Fund may, from time
        to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by
        clients advised or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees,
        may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited
        because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program
        approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the
        securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as
        collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one</div>

<div>The activities of BFA, its
        Affiliates and Entities and their respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and

<div>Shareholder Information</div>
<div>Additional shareholder information,
        including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a
        Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a
        national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum
        investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IJH.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an
        exchange or other secondary market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other
        charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the
        “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally
        lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The
        Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the
        underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of
        not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change
        in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market
        timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of</div>

<div>monitoring for other frequent trading activity
        because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on
        which the Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.
        Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
        restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the
        limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares
        of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust, the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment
        companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of,
        and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund
        are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
        companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of
        stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC
        and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form.</div>
<div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand
        for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized
        portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other
        information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the
        precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be
        viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and</font></div>

<div>Determination of Net Asset Value.
        <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
        (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
        dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced
        closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and
        other assets and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other
        instruments for which market quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing
        price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S.
        securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
        securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not
        readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the
        Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market
        quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event
        subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant
        event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to
        the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith
        approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might</div>

<div>
<div>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale
        of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market
        valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations
        could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and
        the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are
        declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is
        necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on
        shares of the Fund are distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds
        received from the Fund.</div>
<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for
        reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require
        beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole
        shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on
        current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in Fund
        shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax
        consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div>
<div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of
        the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain
        dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the</font></div>

<div>
<div>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that
        qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for
        non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment income,” including,
        but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend
        income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.
        corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends
        received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for
        benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S.
        securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from
        a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the
        Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may
        report dividends eligible for a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by
        allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as
        qualified dividend income, the dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days
        during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the
        181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent

<div>In general, your distributions are

<div>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in
        excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. The
        Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any, carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. A return of
        capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received
        are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a
        citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term
        capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S.
        shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is
        currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S.
        Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct
        and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses
        and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with
        respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine
        certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar
        account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership
        unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out
        pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen
        of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required
        certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital

<div>shares held for one year or less is generally
        treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect
        to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare
        contribution tax mentioned above.</div>
<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes
        some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and
        sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000
        shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the
        “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is
        subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for
        which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio
        generally corresponds <font>pro rata</font> to the holdings of the Fund. However, creation and redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for
        cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed
        only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and
        redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may
        create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or
        other interruption, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed
        at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</div>
<div>To the extent the Fund engages in
        in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any
        securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities</div>

<div>Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933
        Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities
        eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be
        made through a firm that is either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect
        to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption
        orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created
        and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some
        activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery
        and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that
        dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold
        allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of
        prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and
        Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation
        Units. The standard creation and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant
        creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged
        to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable
        business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified) are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the
        table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based
        on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such services.</font></div>

<div>Householding.<font> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain
        shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in
        householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status.<br/>

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent
        distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the
        securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments
        to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain
        investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or
        indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options
        it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial
        incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other iShares funds over another
        investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in
        accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest
        bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or
        below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and
        demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the
        differences (expressed as a percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported
        NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the
        frequency of distributions of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2018 and the first two calendar quarters of 2019.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the
        number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also
        shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the total returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total
        Returns” represents the average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods
        indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of
        one share of the Fund as calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the
        Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the
        Fund's NAV is calculated. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of
        securities and therefore does not incur the expenses incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that
        may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
        would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth
        more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future results.</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
        transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
        performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 14% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
        investment results of the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the small-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones
        Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”). As of March 31, 2019, the Underlying Index included approximately 3% of the market capitalization of all publicly-traded U.S. equity securities.
        The securities in the Underlying Index are weighted based on the float-adjusted market value of their outstanding shares, and have, as of March 31, 2019, a market capitalization between $600 million and $2.4 billion
        at the time of inclusion in the Underlying Index, which may fluctuate depending on the overall level of the equity markets. The securities are selected by SPDJI based on the Index Provider's liquidity measures. The
        Underlying Index consists of securities from a broad range of industries. As of March 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials, industrials
        and information technology industries or sectors. The</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>components of the Underlying Index are likely to
        change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
        indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
        positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
        that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
        performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
        indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
        to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings),
        fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying
        Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally invests at least
        90% of its assets in securities of the Underlying Index and in depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap
        contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help</div>

<div>the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks
        to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities
        representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of
        SPDJI which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market
        value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this
        limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any
        industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
        lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may
        adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the
        significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>markets, a particular financial market or other
        asset classes.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of
        institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
        respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole,
        to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset
        class.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
        Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking</font></div>

<div>
<div>to address system breaches or failures, there are
        inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common
        stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt
        securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic
        conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is
        limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent
        years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the
        Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
        investment objective. Market</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have
        an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index
        in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
        shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected condition.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for
        environmental damage or product liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged
        quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme
        volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or
        cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>

<div>intense competition and potentially rapid product
        obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by,
        among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or services.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an
        issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
        events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
        increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
        volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
        Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
        procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities to which
        the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return
        the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with
        cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies
        Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition, the
        securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and large-capitalization companies.</font></div>

<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
        differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s
        holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>through tax treatment, portfolio transactions
        carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be
        heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>

<td>After-tax returns in the table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns
                    depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as
                    401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same
                    character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or

<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each
        Portfolio Manager supervises a portfolio management team. Ms. Aguirre, Ms. Hsui, Mr. Mason, Mr. Savage and Ms. Whitelaw have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since 2018, 2012, 2016, 2008 and 2018,

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund
        (commonly referred to as an “ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of
        Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue
        or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The
        Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
        distributions that may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally
        will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
        Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
        through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
        intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.</div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important
        information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the
        Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other
        publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other
        instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or
        redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and
        trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular
        segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation
        strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons,
        including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying
        Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index
        Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index
        performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment
        will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the
        divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing
        strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the</div>

<div>securities in its underlying index in approximately
        the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>Under continuous listing standards
        adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying
        Index does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index,
        or obtaining relief from the SEC. Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a
        bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and
        the Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>A Further Discussion of Principal
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund is subject to various
        risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of
        your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries,
        groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in
        comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and
        governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized
        Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
        and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
        delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent
        that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected
        by the</font></div>

<div>underperformance of those securities, may
        experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are
        susceptible to operational, information security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities
        in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks
        faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining
        unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
        Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those
        from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by or
        breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and
        administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial
        losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption
        orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation
        costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund
        inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the
        event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyberattacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention
        and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers
        in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>

<div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk.<font> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations
        that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally subject their holders
        to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the
        prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited
        by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently
        enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector,
        increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various
        countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of
        investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in
        interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject
        to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is
        also a target for cyber-attacks, and may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and
        have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider.
        There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately.
        While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality,
        accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described
        in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider</font></div>

<div>
<div>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or
        guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and
        may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or
        positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be
        underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting
        from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause
        the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility
        could mean that constituents that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the
        Underlying Index to vary from those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to
        reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn
        rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be
        borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking
        error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials
        sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes and changes in
        government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability
        for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the
        industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government
        demand for their products and services.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has

                    activity to the extent a Fund engages in such activity, as expected correlations between related markets or instruments may no longer apply. In addition, to the extent the Fund invests in short-term instruments that
                    have negative yields, the Fund’s value may be impaired as a result. Certain issuers of equity securities have cancelled or announced the suspension of dividends. The outbreak has, and may continue to, negatively

                    ability of employees of the Fund’s service providers to perform critical tasks relating to the Fund, for example, due to the service providers’ employees performing tasks in alternate locations than under

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks
        that may arise in the future could have similar or other unforeseen effects.</div>
<div>Information Technology Sector
        Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies,
        information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological
        developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on
        patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its
        securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages,
        corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may
        also cause their stock prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts
        operations.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a
        result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security or other asset may
        decline due to changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers,
        exchange, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other
        public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market
        downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>

<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by
        market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings. <font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made
        available to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange
        or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in
        others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who
        trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less
        efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with
        more significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund
        shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by
        extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to
        shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at
        Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates
        with changes in the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares
        and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the
        long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,</font></div>

<div>
<div>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature
        is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly
        with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or
        other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing
        to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund
        Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will
        likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the
        “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market
        liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider
        spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly
        from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s
        service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures.
        However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative
        of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on
        U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as
        on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S. public debt level or the imposition of U.S. austerity measures may adversely</font></div>

<div>affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to
        which the Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly
        strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries continue to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The
        U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in
        a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral.
        These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of
        substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk.
        <font>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the Fund's share price may be more volatile than those of funds that
        invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of mid- or
        large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition,
        small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to
        experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of mid- or large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to
        adverse developments concerning their products.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
        between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of
        uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the
        distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of
        increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Other
        Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to
        certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial
        Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to
        include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other
        derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is
        subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and
        other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector
        Risk.<font> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition,
        consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected
        by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk.<font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government regulations, restrictions on government
        reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in
        technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are unknown and may
        be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are
        subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price
        discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful.
        Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S.
        Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or
        disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments
        may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional
        market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial
        market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during
        periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or
        instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although
        the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for
        other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants
        may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward
        pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund,
        which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Real Estate Investment Risk.<font> The Fund may invest in companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) or real estate
        holding and operating companies, which expose investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated.
        Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize
        leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could
        result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices
        for REITs and for properties held by such REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such
        expenses.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or</font></div>

<div>
<div>property type. Economic downturns affecting a
        particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</div>
<div>Equity REITs Risk. <font>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These REITs are often referred to as “Equity REITs.” Equity REITs invest primarily in real properties and may earn
        rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in
        the value of the properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from other properties or poor
        management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices
        for such REITs and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate projects are dependent
        upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment
        obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect
        a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company
        to operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk<font>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities may be volatile. There may
        be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In
        addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to changes in economic or other
        conditions.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects
        its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash
        flow dependency, default by borrowers</font></div>

<div>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions
        between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures in
        certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</div>
<div>Property Risk<font>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant
        bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real
        estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts, changing tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural,
        technological, global or local economic developments and changes in tax law.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk<font>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, reduced
        funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate income and values.</font></div>
<div>Repayment Risk.<font> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to obtain financing either on favorable
        terms or at all. If the properties in which Real Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant
        improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and principal on their loans will be adversely
        affected.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Tax Risk. <font>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income
        taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its
        shareholders may result in the REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including
        excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</font></div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or
        actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be
        restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the
        liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This</font></div>

<div>may increase the risk of the Fund being
        underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</div>
<div>For example, in certain
        circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership
        restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts
        and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client
        accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's
        policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be
        found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment
        of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's
        investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive
        resources.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory
        Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with
        respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary
        expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust).</div>
<div>Effective June 25, 2020, for its
        investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.06%. Prior to June 25, 2020 and for the
        fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.07%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily
        waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA
        at any time.</div>

        PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
        accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other
        funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and
        asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates
        or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime
        broker, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or
        indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from,
        entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with
        which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may
        also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances.
        The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may
        have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and
        may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other payments to Entities in connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities
        may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities,
        currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with
        the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without
        reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from

<div>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities.
        The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in
        which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>In addition, the Fund may, from time
        to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by
        clients advised or managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees,
        may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited
        because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program
        approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the
        securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as
        collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its
        Affiliates and Entities and their respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and
        procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</div>
<div>Shareholder Information</div>
<div>Additional shareholder information,
        including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a
        Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a
        national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum
        investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IJR.”</div>

<div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an
        exchange or other secondary market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other
        charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the
        “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally
        lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The
        Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the
        underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of
        not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change
        in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market
        timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national
        securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on
        which the Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.
        Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act
        restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the
        limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares
        of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief obtained by the Trust, the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment
        companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</div>
<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of,
        and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund
        are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
        companies,</div>

<div>clearing corporations and other institutions that
        directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name,
        and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those
        that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form.</div>
<div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand
        for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized
        portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other
        information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the
        precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be
        viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from
        broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such
        holdings do not trade in the U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value.
        <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
        (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
        dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced
        closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</font></div>
<div>The value of the securities and
        other assets and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>Equity investments and other
        instruments for which market quotations are readily available, as well as investments in an underlying fund, if any, are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last reported official closing
        price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded at the time of valuation.</div>

<div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S.
        securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
        securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not
        readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the
        Board. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market
        quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event
        subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant
        event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to
        the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith
        approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost
        to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be
        the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference
        between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the
        Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are
        declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is
        necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on
        shares of the Fund are distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds
        received from the Fund.</div>
<div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for
        reinvestment of their dividend</font></div>

        their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is
        available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on
        current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in Fund
        shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax
        consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</div>
<div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of
        the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain
        dividends) are taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are taxable to you at
        long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income
        exceeds certain threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on “net investment income,” including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of
        U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div>
<div>Dividends will be qualified dividend
        income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.
        corporations, provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. Substitute dividends
        received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for
        benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily tradable on an established U.S.
        securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</div>
<div>Dividends received by the Fund from
        a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the
        Fund from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31,</div>

<div>
<div>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may
        report dividends eligible for a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by
        allocable Fund expenses.</div>
<div>For a dividend to be treated as
        qualified dividend income, the dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days
        during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the
        181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</div>
<div>Fund distributions, to the extent
        attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</div>
<div>In general, your distributions are
        subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</div>
<div>If the Fund’s distributions
        exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the
        Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. The Fund’s
        capital loss carryforwards, if any, carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. A return of capital
        distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are
        sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a
        citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term
        capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S.
        shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is
        currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S.
        Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct
        and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses
        and taxpayer</div>

        (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to
        report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned out
        pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income.</div>
<div>If you are a resident or a citizen
        of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required
        certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital
        gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as
        long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in
        “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</font></div>
<div>The foregoing discussion summarizes
        some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and
        sales of shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</div>
<div>Creations and Redemptions.<font> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 50,000
        shares or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the
        “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>
<div>A creation transaction, which is
        subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for
        which cash may be substituted) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio

<div>holdings of the Fund. However, creation and
        redemption baskets may differ. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash.</div>
<div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed
        only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and
        redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may
        create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or
        other interruption, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed
        at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</div>
<div>To the extent the Fund engages in
        in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any
        securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933
        Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities

        made through a firm that is either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect
        to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption
        orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>Because new shares may be created
        and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some
        activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery
        and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that
        dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold
        allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For</div>

<div>Costs Associated with Creations and
        Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation
        Units. The standard creation and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant
        creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged
        to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable
        business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified) are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the
        table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based
        on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such services.</font></div>
<div>The following table shows, as of
        April 30, 2019, the approximate value of one Creation Unit, standard fees and maximum additional charges for creations and redemptions (as described above and in the Fund's SAI):</div>

<div>Householding.<font> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain
        shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in
        householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status.</font></div>

<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments
        to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain
        investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or
        indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options
        it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial
        incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other iShares funds over another
        investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in
        accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest
        bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or
        below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and
        demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the
        differences (expressed as a percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported
        NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the
        frequency of distributions of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2018 and the first two calendar quarters of 2019.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the
        number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also
        shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents
        information about the total returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total
        Returns” represents the average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods
        indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of
        one share of the Fund as calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the
        Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the
        Fund's NAV is calculated. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation,
        based on a grouping of financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of
        securities and therefore does not incur the expenses incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that
        may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
        would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth
        more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future results.</div>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock
        Fund Advisors (“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus
        for that Fund (each, an “Underlying Index”). BlackRock International Limited, an affiliate of BFA, serves as the sub-adviser (the “Sub-Adviser”) to the iShares International Preferred Stock
        ETF.</div>
<div>Each Fund offers and issues shares
        at their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities
        (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the
        “Cash Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), The Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) or
        NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) (each a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV.
        Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Portfolio Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 shares or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to
        permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be
        issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 122%,
        which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than
        the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the
        requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing
        and trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>Shares of each Fund are listed for
        trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the
        requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if,
        among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund for 30 or more
        consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which a Fund is based is no longer calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the
        Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund or in the event a Fund
        does not comply with the continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s Prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other
        publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional
        information regarding the indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or
        through other widely disseminated means, an updated indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as</div>

<div>
<div>calculated by an information provider or market
        data vendor. The Trust is not involved in or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has an equity securities
        component and a cash component. The equity securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit Securities required to be
        deposited in connection with the purchase of a Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Funds at a particular point in time because the
        current portfolio of the Funds may include securities that are not a part of the current Deposit Securities. Therefore, a Fund’s IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours should not be viewed
        as a real-time update of the Fund’s NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an
        IOPV consists of estimated accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to
        adjust the share prices of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on
        the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</div>
<div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its
        objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that comprise its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each
        Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s
        portfolio.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative
        sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment
        characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the
        Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>
<div>Although the Funds do not seek
        leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other
        transactions.</font></div>
<div>The purchase of securities while
        borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income.
        Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In
        addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced.
        BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</div>
<div>Certain types of borrowings by a
        Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that
        observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured
        within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Currency Transactions.<font>  A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (“OTC”) obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days
        greater than two days from the date on which the contract is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC currency forward settled in a specified
        currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon</font></div>

<div>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A
        currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a specified
        future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures
        contracts will be maintained. Certain of the Funds do not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of the Funds' assets that are denominated in a non-U.S.
        currency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S. currency forwards, non-deliverable currency forwards and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency
        exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</div>
<div>Foreign exchange transactions
        involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in
        liquidity and prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity
        gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign
        exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a
        Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. A Fund could experience losses if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly
        correlated with its other investments or if it could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, including trading commissions, in
        connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</div>

<div>A fund classified as
        “diversified” under the 1940 Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of
        other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the
        outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its
        classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval. However, while the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Growth ETF, iShares Global 100 ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell Top
        200 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF are classified as “diversified,” under applicable no-action relief from the SEC staff, the funds may become non-diversified, as
        defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of their Underlying Indexes and such a change does not require shareholder
        approval.</div>
<div> A
        “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular
        issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely
        affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by more diversified investment companies.</div>
<div>Each Fund (whether diversified or
        non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal
        Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to</div>

<div>Futures, Options on Futures and
        Securities Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction
        costs. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative
        purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act
        (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such
        Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the
        future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that
        reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities
        and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial
        margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied.
        Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short
        positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by
        taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery
        obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to
        assume a position in the underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer
        of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures
        contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the futures contract. The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures
        contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the
        value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The
        potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may
        purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may
        enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a
        Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided
        by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price
        (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a
        call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its
        portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put
        and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell
        securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or
        depreciation of the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be
        exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be</div>

<div>
<div>structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out Events”). Investments in futures contracts and other investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal
        to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to its obligations relative to the position involved, adjusted daily on a
        marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s daily
        marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional value (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of the underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent
        than if the Fund were required to set aside assets equal to the futures contracts’ full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify
        these policies in the future to comply with any changes in the guidance articulated from time to time by the SEC or its staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment
        companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or other derivatives or make investments in such instruments more expensive.</div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>  Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that
        is maintained in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the
        particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each
        Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are
        collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash
        collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities.
        Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA;
        such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities
        lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the
        extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC
        administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves
        exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If
        a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the
        collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the
        loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money
        if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be
        considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on
        tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management.<font>  Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the “Liquidity Rule”) requires open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to
        establish a liquidity risk management program (the “Liquidity Program”) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program,
        and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Funds, has appointed BFA as the liquidity risk program administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages,
        and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a “highly liquid investment,”</font><font> “moderately liquid investment,”</font><font> “less liquid investment” or “illiquid investment.” The Liquidity Rule defines “liquidity risk” as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem
        shares issued by a Fund without</font></div>

<div>significant dilution of the remaining
        investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are
        exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid
        investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities.<font>  Certain Funds purchase publicly-traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such
        stocks may be in the form of American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) and European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”) (collectively, “depositary
        receipts”). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be
        denominated in the same currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by an American bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs,
        which are sometimes referred to as Continental depositary receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying
        securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities
        markets, and EDRs, issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the world.</font></div>
<div>The Funds will not invest in any
        unlisted depositary receipt or any depositary receipt that BFA deems illiquid at the time of purchase or for which pricing information is not readily available. In general, depositary receipts must be sponsored, but a
        Fund may invest in unsponsored depositary receipts under certain limited circumstances.</div>
<div>Depositary receipts are generally
        subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to
        additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes
        the programs, currency risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do
        not provide holders with many of the shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</div>
<div>Investing in the securities of
        non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility
        of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on
        the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy
        in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding
        Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more
        than a prescribed level of its liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”), or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The
        CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it
        intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from
        the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a
        “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</div>
<div>The iShares Europe ETF, iShares
        International Developed Property ETF, iShares Mortgage Real Estate ETF, iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF, iShares Russell 1000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF, iShares

        pools. BFA has no transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29,
        2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool
        operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a
        claim with the CFTC for such Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of such
        Funds.</div>
<div>Derivative contracts, including,
        without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and
        under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and
        initial margining requirements will be phased in through 2020. Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and
        other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory
        requirements under the 1940 Act, each Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the
        applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the
        contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if
        any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to
        set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the
        purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is
        construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in
        the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the
        collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement
        is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the
        ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain
        risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved
        in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with
        a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount
        of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to
        the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>  Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the
        characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities</font></div>

<div>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase
        agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on
        the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the
        interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements
        may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund’s exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a value equal to or greater than the
        Fund’s obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional
        securities.</div>
<div>Securities of Investment
        Companies.<font>  Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s
        investment in registered investment companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets
        with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund intends from time
        to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits
        discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to
        those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired
        Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary
        Investments.<font>  Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are
        generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by
        the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (“CDs”), bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and
        other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's<sup>®</sup> Investors Service, Inc., “F-1” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or “A-1” by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc. (S&amp;P Global Ratings), or if unrated, of comparable
        quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the
        requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are
        of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained
        in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international
        transactions.</font></div>
<div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional
        amount. In return, the other party agrees to make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the underlying investment or notional amount. Swap
        agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements
        with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an aggregate value at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may enter into
        swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or for the iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF and iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF,
        total return swaps (some of which may be referred to as contracts for difference or “CFDs”). The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from
        those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>

<div>Tracking Stocks.<font>  A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or operating division within a larger company and is designed to
        “track” the performance of such business unit or division. The tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the business unit or
        division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided
        they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and
        Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the
        principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</div>
<div>An investment in a Fund should be
        made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of
        preferred or common stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk. <font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other
        fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk. <font> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and
        depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated
        depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications
        between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is,
        the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets, in part because of the use
        of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted by
        the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits
        on a Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody
        problems and may have no successful claim for compensation.</font></div>
<div>Dividend Risk.<font>  There is no guarantee that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will either remain at current levels or increase over
        time.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk.<font>  Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be
        sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant
        market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a
        Fund may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program
        will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font></div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.
        <font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by a Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that are closed when the securities exchange on which a Fund’s
        shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations may result in premiums or discounts to a Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
        ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external
        processes, or systems or technology failures, that could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of
        operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of
        service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other
        Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Derivatives.<font>  A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver),
        a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options, CFDs (for the iShares Core S&amp;
        P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF and iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF) and other derivatives. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in
        interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to
        counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to
        prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life
        of the investment.</font></div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a
        hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging
        can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge.
        Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will
        be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Equity Securities.<font>  An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers
        may become impaired or that the general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common
        stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and
        unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic
        or banking crises. Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are
        inferior to the rights of creditors, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity (the value of which,
        however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks
        have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to
        decline.</font></div>
<div>Each of the iShares International
        Preferred Stock ETF and the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF invests a significant portion of its assets in preferred stock, although all of the Funds may invest in preferred stock. A Fund that invests in
        preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred stock’s market price may be
        sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert
        the preferred stock into common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred</div>

<div>
<div>stocks may be sensitive to changes in the value of
        the issuer’s common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer may default (<font>i.e.</font>, fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred stock or scheduled interest payments on other obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of
        any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any obligation to pay a
        dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate
        based on market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the
        issuer, which may cause a decrease in the yield of a Fund that invested in the preferred stock.</div>
<div>Although most of the securities in
        each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend
        on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold
        and the value of a Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are wide.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on
        Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be
        closed only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a
        liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a
        discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its
        required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund
        may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures
        contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered stock index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures position
        may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the
        investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct
        investment in the types of stocks in which they invest.</div>
<div>Utilization of futures and options
        on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss
        of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to
        anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market
        generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures
        exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or
        down from the previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that
        limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and
        subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity
        Securities. <font> An investment in any of the Funds that invest, directly or indirectly, in non-U.S. equity securities involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities
        traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock
        prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>domiciled in countries other than the domicile of
        the investor and denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and
        in that country’s currency. These considerations include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection
        with conversions between various currencies. Investing in any of these Funds also involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively
        securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of
        withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures;
        difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets;
        more substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the
        risk of war.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
        Large-Capitalization Companies. <font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and
        subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the
        broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
        Micro-Capitalization Companies. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of micro-capitalization companies. Micro-capitalization companies may have limited operational histories and new or unproven product
        lines, or may have product lines that are still in development. These companies may be more vulnerable than larger companies to key personnel losses due to reliance on a smaller number of management personnel.
        Micro-capitalization companies may have limited financial resources and little or no access to additional credit and therefore may be more susceptible to market down turns or rising credit costs than larger, more
        established companies. Share prices of micro-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and therefore a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than the share prices of funds
        that invest a larger percentage of assets in shares issued by small-, mid-, or large-capitalization companies. The shares of micro-capitalization companies may be thinly traded and may be at risk for delisting from a
        securities exchange, making it difficult for a Fund to buy and sell shares of a particular micro-capitalization company. In addition, there may be less public information available about these companies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
        Mid-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies, and, therefore, a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than
        that of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of
        large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies, making it more difficult for
        the Funds to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to
        adverse developments related to their products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
        Small-Capitalization Companies.<font>  Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies, and, therefore, a Fund's share price may be more volatile than that of funds that
        invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than those of
        large-capitalization or mid-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. The stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Funds to buy and sell
        them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making them more vulnerable to
        loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Non-U.S. Preferred Stock.
        <font> A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate,
        therefore, a preferred stock’s market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the value of the preferred stock is likely to
        decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert the preferred stock into common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks can be sensitive to changes in the value of the
        issuer’s common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer may</font></div>

        any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any obligation to pay a
        dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate
        based on market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the
        issuer, which may cause a decrease in the yield of a fund that invested in the preferred stock. Also, non U.S. preferred stock may have different rights or privileges than those commonly associated with U.S. preferred
        stock. In addition to the risks listed above, investors in non U.S. preferred stock may experience difficulty or uncertainty in determining and enforcing their rights related to preferred stock.</div>
<div>Risk of Swap Agreements.<font>  The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk
        that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations to pay a Fund and the risk that a Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement. If such a default occurs, the
        parties will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s rights as a
        creditor (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive). Swap agreements may also involve the risk that there is an imperfect correlation between
        the return on a Fund's obligation to its counterparty and the return on the referenced asset. In addition, swap agreements are subject to market and liquidity risk, leverage risk and hedging risk.</font></div>
<div>A Fund is required to post and
        collect variation margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Implementation of regulations requiring posting of initial margin is being phased in
        through 2020. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font> A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities
        in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral.
        These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>   Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened
        risks include, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically),
        political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain
        Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have
        democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local
        economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military
        capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of
        an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to
        worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest
        and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this region.</div>
<div>Certain governments in this region
        administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their
        respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private
        sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>

<div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack
        of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition,
        certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are
        dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for
        these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. Adverse economic
        conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by
        companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia.
        <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies
        susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has
        historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of
        securities held by a Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia, Europe and the U.S. The Australia–U.S. Free Trade Agreement has
        significantly expanded the trading relationship between the U.S. and Australia. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australian economy.
        The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of
        mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Canada. <font> The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading and investment partner, and the Canadian economy is significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of
        the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total two-way merchandise trade between the U.S. and Canada has more than doubled. Any downturn in U.S. or
        Mexican economic activity is likely to have an adverse impact on the Canadian economy. The U.S. government has indicated that it may drop out of NAFTA. If this were to occur, it could have a material adverse impact on
        the Canadian economy, which could impact the value of the securities whose value is linked to the Canadian economy. The U.S. has also recently imposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel and threatened that it may
        impose additional tariffs. These actions may have an adverse impact on Canadian securities. The Canadian economy is also dependent upon external trade with other key trading partners, specifically China and the United
        Kingdom (the “U.K.”). As a result, Canada is dependent on the economies of these other countries. In addition, Canada is a large supplier of natural resources (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, oil, natural gas and agricultural products). As a result, the Canadian economy is sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and
        South America. <font> The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high
        unemployment rates and political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the
        regions and many economies in these regions are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of these
        regions.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain
        countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the
        economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on the securities in which a Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and
        South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div>
<div>Certain countries in Central and
        South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency
        values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries
        with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may be the</div>

        imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the
        United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries.
        A Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China. <font> Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities
        markets. Such heightened risks include, among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the
        economy and hostile relations with neighboring countries.</font></div>
<div>Military conflicts, either in
        response to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes with
        Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal
        political, economic, legal, and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong
        may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan that has included threats of invasion; Taiwan-based companies and individuals are
        significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia and
        other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign
        governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and
        Chinese issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the
        Chinese market and may adversely affect performance of the Chinese economy.</div>
<div>The Chinese government has
        implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there can be no
        assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many
        aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. The Chinese government continues to maintain a major role in economic policy making and investing in China involves risk of loss due to
        expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. In addition, there is less regulation and
        monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the U.S.</div>
<div>Accordingly, issuers of securities
        in China, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider trading rules, tender offer
        regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. The Chinese government has taken positions that
        prevent the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) from inspecting the audit work and practices of accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong for compliance with U.S. law and
        professional standards. Audits performed by PCAOB-registered accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong may be less reliable than those performed by firms subject to PCAOB inspection. Accordingly, information
        about the Chinese securities in which the Funds invest may be less reliable or complete. Stock markets in China are in the process of change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in
        the settlement and recording of transactions and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation.</div>
<div>There may be significant obstacles
        to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select investments
        based on investor protection considerations.</div>
<div>While the Chinese economy has
        experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy
        and securities market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products</div>

        other trade barriers or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the securities of Chinese issuers.</div>
<div>The tax laws and regulations in the
        PRC are subject to change, including the issuance of authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are
        not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on a
        Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chinese
        Equity Markets.<font>  The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF may invest in H-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock
        Exchange of Hong Kong (“SEHK”)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”)) or
        Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”)) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF may also invest in certain Hong Kong listed securities known
        as Red-Chips (securities issued by companies incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC
        and derive substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are controlled, directly or indirectly,
        by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</font></div>
<div>Securities listed on the SSE or the
        SZSE are divided into two classes: A-shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on the SSE and SZSE), which are mostly limited to domestic investors, and
        B-shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A-shares market is generally subject to greater government restrictions, including trading suspensions, which may lead to increased
        liquidity risks. The B-shares market is generally smaller, less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A-shares market, which may lead to significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips
        of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a “back-door
        listing” through Red-Chips or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. “Back-door listing” is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues
        Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. All of these share mechanisms are relatively untested and subject to political and economic policies in China. Market
        developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government intervention (including the possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may make it difficult to
        acquire, dispose of or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to the Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed
        Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies in the financial services
        sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
        Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue
        growth for such companies. If financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a
        correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their
        perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries.
        As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions
        in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension
        costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as
        crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries
        generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause</font></div>

        In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession.
        Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging
        Markets. <font>  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic
        stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses,
        foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local
        governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi)
        capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest
        payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and investors may experience
        difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the
        local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis,
        substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select investments based on investor
        protection considerations.</font></div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets
        are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such
        securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in
        securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market
        countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not
        be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The
        limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly
        influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and
        reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at
        the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries
        suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private
        property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets.
        Certain emerging market countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in
        the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities
        markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the
        Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities
        or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack
        the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor
        strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high
        levels of unemployment or</div>

<div>underemployment; (iv) changes in government
        economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases,
        capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in
        some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</div>
<div>Emerging markets also have
        different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it
        difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in
        emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget
        deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served
        as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an
        inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or
        have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing,
        but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe. <font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The
        economies and markets of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in
        securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union (the “EU”). A number of
        countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the “eurozone”) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with
        restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in
        governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on
        its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries
        are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial
        markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but
        not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute
        “capital controls.” Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default
        or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in
        countries other than those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may
        continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central
        banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences.
        Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more
        countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely
        impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region. The U.K. left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, subject to a transitional period ending December 31, 2020. During the transitional period,
        although the U.K. is no longer a member state of the EU, it remains subject to EU law and regulations as if it were still a member state. The U.K. and the EU are to negotiate the terms of their future trading
        relationship during the transitional period. Accordingly, the terms of such trading relationship remain uncertain. The outcome of such negotiations may give rise</font></div>

<div>
<div>to significant uncertainties and instability in
        the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates the terms of its future relationship with the EU. A Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences leading up to and that may follow
        Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to
        instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new
        relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure
        and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly
        those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater
        or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU and the
        terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Certain European countries have
        also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as
        the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the
        national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may
        experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also
        could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Japan. <font> Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.<br/>
</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. The growth of Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally
        remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other
        protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a
        negative impact on the Japanese economy.<br/>
</font></div>
<div>Political Risk<font>. Historically, Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely
        affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should political tension increase,
        it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.<br/>
</font></div>
<div>Large Government and Corporate Debt
        Risk<font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by
        major corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.<br/>
</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in
        the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses
        to investors.<br/>
</font></div>
<div>Nuclear Energy Risk. <font>The nuclear power plant catastrophe in Japan in March 2011 may have long-term effects on the Japanese economy and its nuclear energy industry, the extent of which are currently unknown.<br/>
</font></div>
<div>Labor Risk<font>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a
        labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.<br/>

<div>
<div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn,
        could negatively affect a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk.<font> Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense
        concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has shown concern over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and
        adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Middle
        East. <font> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in
        the Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and foreign currency
        values. As global demand for oil fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>In addition, many Middle Eastern
        governments have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies,
        including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private
        sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in the Fund's portfolio.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are
        in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a
        high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle
        Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of
        the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a
        corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a
        U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their
        capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of
        investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous
        terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign
        investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a
        Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible
        on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may
        be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and,
        consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div>
<div>Substantial limitations may exist
        in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required
        governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries
        may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other
        protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they
        trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and
        the United Nations, and/or countries identified</div>

<div>
<div>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of
        terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be
        indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries
        have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of
        these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an
        aggressive push for territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and
        Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of
        intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America.
        <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North
        American region and on some or all of the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's
        largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico,
        total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade
        arrangements among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American
        markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United
        Kingdom. <font> Investment in U.K. issuers may subject a Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to the U.K. The U.K. economy relies heavily on the export of
        financial services to the U.S. and other European countries. A prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a negative impact on the U.K.’s economy. In the past, the U.K. has been a target of
        terrorism. Acts of terrorism in the U.K. or against U.K. interests abroad may cause uncertainty in the U.K. financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a Fund has exposure.
        Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to
        leave the EU (Brexit). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K.
        businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences
        that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could
        contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new
        relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure
        and any other assets that the Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those
        in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and
        falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU. Recently, the U.K.'s
        real estate sector has experienced significant volatility and declines in the value of many real estate securities, including real estate funds, real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate
        holding companies. Increased volatility and investor redemption requests in real estate funds may result in the continued decline in the value and liquidity of real estate securities, which may impair the ability of a
        Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Economic Trading Partners
        Risk. <font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, the country or countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic
        conditions of such countries may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy has recently experienced very difficult conditions and increased volatility, as well as significant adverse
        trends. While government intervention and recent legislation has been</font></div>

<div>
<div>enacted to improve the U.S. economy, the recovery
        has been fragile and modest. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material
        adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Aerospace
        and Defense Industry. <font> The aerospace and defense industry can be significantly affected by government defense and aerospace regulation and spending policies. The aerospace industry in particular has
        recently been affected by adverse economic conditions and consolidation within the industry.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic
        Materials Industry. <font> Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, import controls and increased competition. Companies in
        the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials
        operations, and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic
        materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government
        regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental policies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Biotechnology Industry. <font> Biotechnology companies depend on the successful development of new and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be
        successful or that intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property rights may adversely affect the profitability of biotechnology
        companies. In addition, companies in the biotechnology industry spend heavily on research and development and their products or services may not prove commercially successful or may become obsolete quickly. The risks
        of high development costs may be exacerbated by the inability to raise prices as a result of managed care pressure, government regulation or price controls. Biotechnology companies can suffer persistent losses during
        the transition of new products from development to production or when products are or may be subject to regulatory approval processes or regulatory scrutiny and, as a consequence, the earnings of biotechnology
        companies may be erratic. Companies in the biotechnology industry are also exposed to the risk that they will be subject to products liability claims. Companies involved in the biotechnology industry may be subject to
        extensive government regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among other foreign and domestic regulators. Such regulation
        may significantly affect and limit biotechnology research, product development and approval of products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Capital
        Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods
        industry depend heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease
        due to weakening demand, worsening business cash flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods
        industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates, corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market
        conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chemicals
        Industry. <font> The success of companies in the chemicals industry can be significantly affected by intense competition, product obsolescence, raw materials prices, and government regulation. As
        regulations are developed and enforced, chemicals companies could be required to alter or cease production of a product, pay fines, pay for cleaning up a disposal site or agree to restrictions on their operations. In
        addition, chemicals companies may be subject to risks associated with production, handling, and disposal, as some of the materials and processes used by these companies involve hazardous components.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Clean Energy
        Sub-Industry. <font> Many clean energy companies are involved in the development and commercialization of new technologies, which may be subject to delays resulting from budget constraints and
        technological difficulties. Clean energy companies may be highly dependent upon government subsidies and contracts with government entities, and may be negatively affected if such subsidies or contracts are
        unavailable. Clean energy companies may depend on the successful development of new and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that
        intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property rights may adversely affect the profitability of clean energy companies. In

<div>seasonal weather conditions, fluctuations in
        supply of, and demand for, clean energy products, changes in energy prices, international political events, the success of project development and change in government regulatory policies may cause fluctuations in the
        performance of clean energy companies and the prices of their securities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Communication Services Sector. <font> The communication services sector consists of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of
        companies in the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group
        encompass a variety of services and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review websites and Internet search engines.</font></div>
<div>The communication services sector
        of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of
        new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be
        arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing
        new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</div>
<div>The domestic telecommunications
        market is characterized by increasing competition and regulation by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and various state regulatory authorities. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain
        franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited
        availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other
        negative effects in the future.</div>
<div>Companies in the media and
        entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a
        potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential increase in state and federal government regulation. Companies in the media and
        entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases
        and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer
        Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio
        broadcasting, manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational
        equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly.
        The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples
        sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic
        and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest
        rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer
        Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and
        office products, clothing and textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer
        confidence and consumer disposable income. The consumer goods industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various
        food additives may affect the profitability of certain companies in the consumer goods industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net
        income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and</font></div>

        demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in
        demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer
        Services Industry. <font> The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the
        performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer
        spending. Companies in the consumer services industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the
        success of consumer service providers.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer
        Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and
        production spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government
        regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In
        addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of,
        demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates,
        import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may
        also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy
        Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy
        production and conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business
        lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in
        a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment.</font></div>
<div>The energy sector is cyclical and
        is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes,
        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and
        the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices have recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may
        be adversely affected by terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or
        other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets
        countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may
        operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may
        also be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events
        in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social
        unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and
        utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to
        significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter</div>

<div>
<div>laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be
        enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials
        Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty
        finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</font></div>
<div>Most financial companies are
        subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have
        significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial
        markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of
        governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be
        subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures,
        including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain
        foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In addition,
        companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings
        and loan associations and financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the
        value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without
        limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things,
        credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic
        conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly
        dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial
        condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses.
        In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also
        be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased government intervention. In addition, there
        is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare
        Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical
        expenses, rising or falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other
        market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration,
        and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the
        product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of
        these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products
        and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar
        claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>result in price discounting. Many new products in
        the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of
        competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory
        approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare
        companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are
        subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national
        health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a
        number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on
        companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of
        facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these
        expansions, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities.
        Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public
        funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Home
        Construction Industry. <font> The home construction industry may be significantly affected by changes in government spending, zoning laws, economic conditions, interest rates, commodity prices, consumer
        confidence and spending, taxation, demographic patterns, real estate values, overbuilding, housing starts, and new and existing home sales. Rising interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability to consumers,
        increasing foreclosure rates or increases in the costs of owning a home could reduce the market for new homes and adversely affect the profitability of home construction companies. Different segments of the home
        construction industry can be significantly affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts. Home construction companies may lack diversification, due
        to ownership of a limited number of properties and concentration in a particular geographic region or property type.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Hotel &amp;
        Lodging REITs Sub-Industry. <font> Hotel and lodging properties are management and labor intensive and particularly susceptible to the impact of general and local economic conditions. Unlike other types of properties,
        to meet competition in the industry, to maintain franchise standards, or to maintain economic values, continuing expenditures must be made for modernizing, refurnishing, and maintaining existing facilities prior to
        the expiration of their anticipated useful lives. If such expenditures are not made, the value and profitability of the hotels may be diminished. In addition, inflationary pressures could increase operating expenses
        of the hotels, including energy costs, above expected levels, and have secondary effects upon occupancy rates in such hotels by increasing the expense or decreasing the availability of means of travel. All of the
        factors noted above may contribute to producing operating results of wider variation than for other types of properties.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials
        Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for
        industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade
        disputes, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which
        may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in
        this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by
        governmental defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be
        significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which
        may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines</font></div>

<div>
<div>and unit volume reductions resulting from an
        over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims,
        depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Information
        Technology Sector. <font> Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies,
        information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological
        developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology,
        especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights.
        The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the information
        technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. These risks
        are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection
        with capital construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of
        services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in
        exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects,
        especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a
        significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil
        and gas industry may be adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social
        unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market countries, which may heighten these risks.</div>
<div>Operations Risk. <font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by
        environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be
        replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk. <font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service
        interruption due to environmental, operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk. <font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or
        irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk. <font>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure
        company's operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Inflation Risk. <font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure
        company is able to charge users of its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the
        company's profitability.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Risk. <font>The stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic
        conditions may affect the performance of companies in the transportation industry group.</font></div>
<div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility
        companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Insurance
        Industry. <font> The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions,
        price and marketing competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in
        mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Materials
        Sector. <font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, social and political unrest, import controls, increased competition,
        depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to
        which a Fund has exposure. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market
        imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Medical
        Equipment Industry. <font> Many companies in the medical equipment industry are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.
        Companies in the medical equipment industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims as well as competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact,
        may result in price discounting. The profitability of some medical equipment companies may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry
        innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the medical equipment industry are subject to regulatory approvals, and the process of obtaining such approvals is long and
        costly.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Mortgage Real
        Estate Investment Trusts. <font> Mortgage REITs lend money to developers and owners of properties and invest primarily in mortgages and similar real estate interests. The mortgage REITs receive interest payments
        from the owners of the mortgaged properties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are subject to the credit risk of the borrowers to whom they extend funds. Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will not be able to make
        timely interest and principal payments on the loan to the REIT. Mortgage REITs also are subject to the risk that the value of mortgaged properties may be less than the amounts owed on the properties. If a mortgage
        REIT is required to foreclose on a borrower, the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed to the mortgage REIT.</font></div>
<div> Mortgage REITs are subject
        to significant interest rate risk. During periods when interest rates are declining, mortgages are often refinanced or prepaid. Refinancing or prepayment of mortgages may reduce the yield of mortgage REITs. When
        interest rates decline, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations
        can be expected to decline. In addition, rising interest rates generally increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could cause the value of a mortgage REIT’s investments to decline. A REIT’s
        investment in adjustable rate obligations may react differently to interest rate changes than an investment in fixed rate obligations. As interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans are reset periodically, yields
        on a REIT’s investment in such loans will gradually align themselves to reflect changes in market interest rates, causing the value of such investments to fluctuate less dramatically in response to interest rate
        fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations.</div>

<div>
<div> Mortgage REITs typically use
        leverage (and in many cases, may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a REIT’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates, increased interest rate
        volatility, downturns in the economy and reductions in the availability of financing or deterioration in the conditions of the REIT’s mortgage-related assets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Natural
        Resources Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the natural resources industry can be affected by worldwide energy prices, limits on exploration, and production spending. Companies in the natural
        resources industry are affected by government regulation, world events and economic conditions. Companies in the natural resources industry are at risk for environmental damage claims. Companies in the natural
        resources industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls and increased competition. Companies in the natural resources industry may be
        adversely affected by depletion of natural resources, technological developments, and labor relations.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas
        Industry. <font> Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies,
        oil and gas production and conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified
        personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to
        national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of
        key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact companies in this industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in
        emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In addition, the Middle East, where many companies in the oil and
        gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant portion of their revenues may
        depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil
        Equipment and Services Sub-Industry. <font> The profitability of companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending. Companies in the oil
        equipment and services sub-industry may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may be at risk for environmental damage claims and
        other types of litigation. Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, imposition of import
        controls and increased competition. Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may be adversely affected by oil deposits, technological developments and labor relations. Companies in the oil equipment
        and services sub-industry may be adversely affected by government regulation and intervention, negative perception and world events in the regions that the companies operate (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest,
        violence or labor unrest). Companies in the oil equipment and services sub-industry may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market countries, which may heighten these
        risks.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Pharmaceuticals Industry. <font> Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The
        profitability of some companies in the pharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in
        technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to government approvals, regulation and reimbursement rates. The process of obtaining government approvals may
        be long and costly. Many companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are heavily dependent on patents and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of
        these companies. Companies in the pharmaceutical industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Producer
        Durables Industry. <font> The producer durables industry includes companies involved in the design, manufacture or distribution of industrial durables such as electrical equipment and components, industrial
        products, and housing and telecommunications equipment. These companies may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies and politics, consolidation, and excess capacity. Companies in the producer

<div>
<div>intense competition, which may have an adverse
        effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the producer durables industry may be strongly affected by changes in consumer demands, spending, tastes and preferences. Companies in the producer durables
        industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Producer durables companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the
        intellectual property rights of others. In addition, these companies may be significantly affected by other factors such as economic cycles, rapid technical obsolescence, government regulations, labor relations,
        delays in modernization, overall capital spending levels and product liability lawsuits.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate
        Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies
        (collectively, “Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which
        Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic
        overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations.
        Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market
        value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect
        the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate
        sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and
        ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects
        its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers
        or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a
        Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies;
        catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts
        or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Distressed Investment Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure
        programs involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that
        may become non-performing, including the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the
        securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by
        commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available
        to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately
        negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred
        equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated</font></div>

<div>
<div>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed
        securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a
        holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash
        flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real
        Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be
        limited.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk.<font> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of
        small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell
        transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may
        have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular
        region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income
        taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its
        shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including
        excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law
        changes or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may
        force certain Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Retail
        Industry. <font> The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and
        preferences. Companies in the retail industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social
        trends, marketing campaigns and public perceptions. Companies in the retail industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many of these companies are dependent on third party
        suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Semiconductor Industry. <font> The Fund invests in semiconductor companies, which face intense competition, both domestically and internationally; such competition may have an adverse effect on profit margins.
        Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of semiconductor companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new
        product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial and equipment generally suffers from rapid
        obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights would adversely affect the profitability of these
        companies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology
        Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both
        domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less</font></div>

<div>experienced companies and may be subject to
        greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The
        products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes
        in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment,
        those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on
        patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
        commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be
        particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or
        failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically
        in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial
        capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies
        obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or
        consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
        Transportation Infrastructure Industry. <font> Issuers in the transportation infrastructure industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates,
        industry competition, insurance costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and airports. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant
        government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating
        costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Companies in the transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by adverse weather, acts of terrorism or catastrophic
        events, such as air accidents, train crashes or tunnel fires. Companies in the transportation infrastructure industry may also be subject to the risk of widespread disruption of technology systems and increasing
        equipment and operational costs.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities
        Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws,
        interest rate fluctuations and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as
        well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility
        profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences
        among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future,
        grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's
        portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and
        operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a
        hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional
        regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not
        occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt</div>

<div>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity
        securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more
        similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business.
        As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in
        riskier ventures.</div>
<div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For all Funds, the Board has
        delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted policies
        and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting
        Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders,
        on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that
        might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural
        separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or
        dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an
        independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div>
<div>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy
        Voting Policy, the BlackRock Global Proxy Voting Policies and the BlackRock U.S. Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendices A1, A2 and A3, respectively.</div>
<div>Information with respect to how
        proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds'
        website at <font>www.iShares.com</font>; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy
        regarding the disclosure of the Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests
        of each Fund’s respective shareholders; (ii) does not put the interests of BFA, the Distributor or any affiliated person of BFA or the Distributor, above those of Fund shareholders; (iii) does not advantage any
        current or prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund shareholders, except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not
        available to other current or prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary for transactions in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided
        to personnel of BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of the Fund for the purpose of facilitating risk management and hedging activities; and (iv) does
        not provide selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting the use of such information are in
        effect. The “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based subscription
        services, large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and
        market makers and other institutional market participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's
        portfolio holdings information is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to
        those other fee-based subscription services, including market makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming

        concerning the Funds' portfolio holdings is permitted: (i) to certain personnel of those service providers that are involved in portfolio management and providing administrative, operational, risk management, or other
        support to portfolio management; and (ii) to other personnel of the Funds' investment adviser (and Sub-Adviser), the Distributor and their affiliates, and the administrator, custodian and fund accountant who
        deal directly with, or assist in, functions related to investment management, distribution, administration, custody, securities lending and fund accounting, as may be necessary to conduct business in the ordinary
        course in a manner consistent with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. In addition, each Fund discloses its fixed-income and/or equity portfolio holdings daily at <font>www.iShares.com</font>. More information about this disclosure is available at <font>www.iShares.com</font>.</div>
<div>Portfolio holdings information made
        available in connection with the creation/redemption process may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds in the ordinary course of business after it has been disseminated to the NSCC. From
        time to time, information concerning portfolio holdings other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, may be provided to other
        entities that provide services to the Funds, including rating or ranking organizations, in the ordinary course of business, no earlier than one business day following the date of the information.</div>
<div>Each Fund discloses its complete
        portfolio holdings schedule in public filings with the SEC within 70 days of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters and within 60 days of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters and will provide such
        information to shareholders as required by federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. A Fund may, however, voluntarily disclose all or part of its portfolio holdings other than in connection with the
        creation/redemption process, as discussed above, in advance of required filings with the SEC, provided that such information is made generally available to all shareholders and other interested parties in a manner
        that is consistent with the above policy for disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Such information may be made available through a publicly available website or other means that make the information available
        to all likely interested parties contemporaneously.</div>
<div>The Trust's Chief Compliance
        Officer or his delegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio holdings information pursuant to the above policy and procedures, subject to restrictions on selective disclosure imposed by applicable law.</div>

<div>Construction and Maintenance of
        the Underlying Indexes</div>
<div>Descriptions of the Underlying
        Indexes are provided below.</div>
<div>With respect to certain underlying
        indexes of the iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed
        investment concepts and strategies that could be considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted such indices using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the
        relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its sole discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the
        rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the underlying index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also
        provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or pursuant to other communications with the index provider.</div>

<div>trusts, units, limited partnerships,
        over-the-counter bulletin boards and pink sheet stocks generally are not eligible for inclusion in the indexes.</div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> Each Underlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced quarterly to maintain accurate representation of the market segment represented by the Underlying Index. Securities that are removed from
        an Index between reconstitution dates are not replaced.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Maintaining the Underlying Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for additions and deletions to each Underlying Index, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends,
        and stock price adjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs. Generally (other than with respect to the Dow Jones Select Sector and Subsector Indexes (as defined below)) each component security in an Underlying
        Index is limited to a maximum market capitalization of 25% of the index weight, and sum of the weights of all component securities greater than 5% of the index is limited to 50% of the index total. If components fail
        either rule, their market capitalization will be reduced to meet the set guidelines.</font></div>
<div>Weighting.<font> The component stocks are weighted according to the float-adjusted market capitalization. The impact of a component’s price change is proportional to the issue’s total market
        value, which is the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Each Underlying Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions
        and other capital events. Each of the Underlying Indexes (except the Dow Jones Select Sector and Subsector Indexes) as described below, is a free-float adjusted market capitalization-weighted index, so the impact of a
        component’s price change is proportional to the component’s free-float adjusted market value, which is the share price multiplied by the number of float-adjusted shares outstanding. S&amp;P Dow Jones
        Indices LLC (“SPDJI”) defines the free-float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by investors. In practice,
        limitations on free-float available to investors include: cross ownership (shares that are owned by other companies), ownership by governments (central or municipal) or their agencies, certain substantial levels of
        private ownership (by individuals, families or charitable trusts and foundations), and restricted shares. Under SPDJI's free-float adjustment methodology, a company’s outstanding shares are adjusted if, and only
        if, an entity in any of the four qualified categories listed above owns 5% or more of the company. The company’s shares will not be adjusted if the block ownership is less than 5%. A constituent’s
        inclusion factor is equal to its estimated percentage of free-float shares outstanding. For example, a constituent security with a free-float of 67% will be included in the index at 67% of its market capitalization.
        However, a company’s outstanding shares are not adjusted by institutional investors’ holdings, which include, but are not limited to, the following categories: custodian nominees, trustee companies, mutual
        funds (open-end and closed-end funds), and other investment companies.</font></div>

        Banks Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Select Telecommunications Index, on the last business day of the month prior to the quarterly review, a security must have a $500 million float-adjusted market capitalization to be
        added to a Dow Jones Select Sector and Subsector Index; securities with a float-adjusted market capitalization below $250 million will be removed from the applicable Dow Jones Select Sector and Subsector
        Index.</font></div>

        Construction Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Select Telecommunications Index, on the last business day of the month prior to the quarterly review, a security must have a $500 million float-adjusted market capitalization
        to be added to a Dow Jones Select Sectors Index; securities with a float-adjusted market capitalization below $100 million will be removed from the applicable Dow Jones Select Sectors Index.</div>
<div>For the Dow Jones U.S. Select
        Regional Banks Index, index composition is reconstituted annually as part of the June rebalancing.

        the time of issuance to qualify. Fixed-to-floating rate securities are included provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one month from the last call prior to the date the bond
        transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Contingent capital securities (“cocos”) are excluded, but capital securities where conversion can be mandated by a regulatory authority, but which have
        no specified trigger, are included. Other hybrid capital securities, such as those issues that potentially convert into preference shares, those with both cumulative and noncumulative coupon deferral provisions, and
        those with alternative coupon satisfaction mechanisms, are also included in the index. 144A securities (both with and without registration rights) and corporate pay-in-kind securities (including toggle notes) are
        included. Securities in legal default, securitized debt and Eurodollar bonds (USD securities not issued in the U.S. domestic market) are excluded.</font></div>
<div>Preferred stock and notes issued in
        $25, $50, or $100 par/liquidation preference increments, must have a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. In addition, qualifying securities must have an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an
        average of Moody’s, S&amp;P and Fitch foreign currency long-term sovereign debt ratings). Both fixed and adjustable rate preferred stock and notes are included in the index. Preference shares (perpetual
        preferred securities), American Depository Shares/Receipts (ADS/R), domestic and Yankee trust preferreds, are included. Auction market securities, purchase units, purchase contracts, securities issued by closed end
        funds and derivative instruments such as repackaged securities and credit default swaps are excluded.</div>
<div>Convertible preferred stock must
        have at least $50 million face amount outstanding. The underlying equity of qualifying securities must be publicly listed and actively trading. Convertible securities where the underlying is a basket of equities, and
        mandatory convertibles are included in the index. Securities in legal default, synthetic and reverse convertibles, pay-in-kind convertibles, and convertibles with suspended or inactive underlying equities are excluded
        from the index.</div>
<div>JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return
        Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 400</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return Index was jointly developed by Japan Exchange Group, Inc. and Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (“TSE”) (collectively referred to as the “JPX
        Group”) and Nikkei Inc. (the “Nikkei”). The JPX-Nikkei 400 Net Total Return Index is constructed based on market capitalization adjusted by free-float weight. Free-float weight is the percentage of
        listed shares deemed to be available for trading in the market. As a general matter, shares held by the top 10 major shareholders, treasury and other similar shares, shares held by board members and other
        representatives, and other shares deemed by the JPX Group and the Nikkei to be unavailable for trading in the market are considered to be non-free float shares.</font></div>
<div>Eligibility.<font> Underlying Index eligibility is limited to (i) common stocks traded primarily on the TSE, including the First Section, Second Section, Mothers and JASDAQ market (“JASDAQ”)
        market (in principle) and (ii) TSE First Section, TSE Second Section, Mothers or JASDAQ-listed securities other than common stocks that are regarded by the JPX Group and the Nikkei as equivalent to common stocks in
        each case if their inclusion is deemed to be particularly necessary- as determined by the JPX Group and the Nikkei.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance and Issue
        Changes. <font>The constituents are reviewed annually at the end of August. Selection as particularly necessary is based on: (i) trading value over the past three years, (ii) market value on the selection
        base date (the end of June), (iii) scoring by stock by three-year average returns on equity, cumulative operating profit and market value on the selection base date using specified weightings and (iv) qualitative
        factors tied to corporate governance and disclosure. The JPX Group and the Nikkei have indicated that securities will be dropped from the Underlying Index during the year if they are delisted or are the subject of a
        merger or bankruptcy and that new securities will not be added to replace dropped securities until the annual review. As a result, at different points throughout the calendar year, the Underlying Index may have less
        than 400 components.</font></div>

<div>NASDAQ Biotechnology Index<sup>®</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 221</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is designed to track the performance of a set of securities listed on NASDAQ that are classified as either biotechnology or pharmaceutical according to the
        Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB). The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is a modified market capitalization-weighted index.</font></div>
<div>Eligibility.<font> Underlying Index eligibility is limited to common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs, and shares of beneficial interest or limited partnership interests that are listed on NASDAQ. Companies
        must also meet certain minimum market capitalization, liquidity, and other criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance and Issue
        Changes.<font> Index securities are evaluated annually in December. Generally, the list of additions and deletions is publicly announced via a press release in the early part of December. Security
        additions and deletions are made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday in December. Moreover, if at any time during the year other than the evaluation, an index security no longer meets the
        eligibility criteria, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for continued inclusion in the Underlying Index, the security is removed from the Underlying Index and will not be replaced.</font></div>
<div>Quarterly Index Rebalancing.<font> The Underlying Index employs a modified market capitalization-weighting methodology. At each quarter, the Index is rebalanced such that the maximum weight of any index security does not
        exceed 8% and no more than 5 securities are at that cap. The excess weight of any capped security is distributed proportionally across the remaining index securities. If after redistribution, any of the 5 highest
        ranked index securities are weighted below 8%, these securities are not capped. Next, any remaining index securities in excess of 4% are capped at 4% and the excess weight is redistributed proportionally across the
        remaining index securities. The process is repeated, if necessary, to derive the final weights.</font></div>
<div>The modified market
        capitalization-weighting methodology is applied to the capitalization of each index security using the last sale price of the security at the close of trading on the last trading day in February, May, August and
        November and after applying quarterly changes to the total shares outstanding. The changes are effective after trading on the third Friday in March, June, September and December.</div>
<div>NASDAQ may, from time to time,
        exercise reasonable discretion as it deems appropriate in order to ensure Underlying Index integrity.</div>
<div>NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet U.S. Infrastructure Index<sup>TM</sup></div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 150</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The NYSE<sup>®</sup> FactSet U.S. Infrastructure Index<sup>TM</sup> is designed to measure the performance of equity securities of U.S. companies involved in U.S. focused infrastructure
        activities (as determined by the index provider of the Underlying Index).</font></div>
<div>Companies are eligible to be
        included in the Underlying Index if they are classified to be under one of the 95 infrastructure-related industries as defined by FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (“RBICS”). Each
        company in the Underlying Index is classified as either Category 1 or Category 2, where Category 1 companies are infrastructure enablers and Category 2 are infrastructure asset owners and operators.</div>
<div>Infrastructure enablers are
        potential beneficiaries of infrastructure investment in the U.S. Category 1 companies in the Underlying Index include companies in construction and engineering services, machineries and materials. Infrastructure asset
        owners and operators are companies associated with traditional equity infrastructure investing, which generally exhibit characteristics such as having stable cash flows, a high barrier to entry, and being an inflation
        hedge. Category 2 companies in the Underlying Index include companies in energy transportation and storage, railroad transportation, and utilities.</div>
<div>At the time of inclusion, eligible
        companies must derive 50% or more of their annual revenues from the U.S. The Underlying Index applies an equal weighting to Category 1 and Category 2, and within each category, an equal weighting is also applied to
        all individual securities.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index will be
        reviewed and reconstituted annually in March each year. Constituent weights of the Underlying Index are rebalanced quarterly in March, June, September and December.</div>

<div>The PHLX Semiconductor Sector
        Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 30</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index is designed to track the performance of U.S.-traded securities of a set of companies engaged in the design, distribution, manufacture and sale of
        semiconductors.</font></div>
<div>Index Calculation. <font>The Underlying Index is a modified capitalization-weighted index. The value of the Underlying Index equals the aggregate value of the Underlying Index share weights, also known as the Index
        Shares, of each of the Underlying Index securities multiplied by each such security’s Last Sale Price<sup>1</sup>, and divided by the divisor of the Underlying Index. The divisor serves the purpose of scaling such aggregate index value to
        a lower order of magnitude which is more desirable for reporting purposes. The Underlying Index began on December 1, 1993 at a base value of 200.00 and was split two-for-one on July 24, 1995; options commenced trading
        on September 7, 1994.</font></div>
<div>The formula for index value is as
        follows:</div>
<div>
<table>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>Two versions of the Underlying
        Index are calculated – a price return index and a total return index.</div>
<div>The price return index (NASDAQ:
        SOX) is ordinarily calculated without regard to cash dividends on Underlying Index securities.</div>
<div>The total return index (NASDAQ:
        XSOX) reinvests cash dividends on the ex-date.</div>
<div>Both Indexes reflect extraordinary
        cash distributions. The total return index was synchronized to the value of the price return index at the close on December 22, 2009.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is calculated
        during the trading day and is disseminated once per second from 09:30:01 to 17:16:00 ET. The closing value of the Underlying Index may change up until 17:15:00 ET due to corrections to the Last Sale Price of the
        Underlying Index securities. If trading in an Underlying Index security is halted on its primary listing market, the most recent Last Sale Price is used for all index computations until trading on such market resumes.
        Likewise, the most recent Last Sale Price is used if trading in a security is halted on its primary listing market before the market is open.</div>

<div>Index Evaluation.<font> The Underlying Index securities are evaluated annually in September. The above Eligibility Criteria are applied using market data as of the end of July. Securities meeting the Criteria are
        then ranked by market capitalization. The top 30 securities by market capitalization are included in the Underlying Index. Security additions and deletions are made effective after the close of trading on the third
        Friday in September.</font></div>
<div>Additionally, if at any time during
        the year other than during the ranking review, an Underlying Index security is determined to have become ineligible for continued inclusion in the Underlying Index, or at the end of January, April, July or October
        does not have a Last Sale Price of at least $3.00, then the security will be replaced with the largest market capitalization security not currently in the Index and that both meets the Eligibility Criteria listed
        above and has at least a $3.00 Last Sale Price. Ordinarily, a security will be removed from the Index at its Last Sale Price. If, however, at the time of its removal a security is halted from trading on its primary
        listing market and an official closing price cannot be readily determined, the security may, in NASDAQ’s discretion, be removed at a zero price. The zero price will be applied to the security after the close of
        the market but prior to the time the official closing value of the Index is disseminated, which is ordinarily 17:16:00 ET.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Changes in the price and/or Index Shares driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, stock splits and certain spin-offs and rights issuances are adjusted on the ex-date. If the
        change in total shares outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal to 10.0%, the change is made as soon as practicable. (If a security is a depositary receipt, the total shares
        outstanding is the actual depositary shares outstanding as reported by the depositary banks.) Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less than 10.0%, then all such changes are accumulated through the
        end of February, May, August and November and made effective at one time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September and December. The Index Shares are
        adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the total shares outstanding have changed.</font></div>
<div>A special cash dividend announced
        by the listing exchange will result in an adjustment to the Last Sale Price of an Underlying Index security prior to market open on the ex-date for the special amount distributed. A special dividend may also be
        referred to as extra, extraordinary, non-recurring, one-time, unusual, etc.</div>
<div>Ordinarily, whenever there is a
        change in Index Shares, a change in a security, or a change to the price of a security due to spin-offs, rights issuances or special cash dividends, the Divisor is adjusted to ensure that there is no discontinuity in
        the value of the Underlying Index which might otherwise be caused by any such change. All changes are announced in advance and are reflected in the Underlying Index prior to market open on the Underlying Index
        effective date.</div>

<div>Index Rebalancing.<font> The Underlying Index employs a modified market capitalization-weighting methodology. At each quarter, the Underlying Index is rebalanced such that the maximum weight of any security does
        not exceed 8% and no more than 5 securities are at that cap. The excess weight of any capped security is distributed proportionally across the remaining securities in the Underlying Index. If after redistribution, any
        of the five highest ranked securities in the Underlying Index are weighted below 8%, these securities are not capped. Next, any remaining securities in excess of 4% are capped at 4% and the excess weight is
        redistributed proportionally across the remaining securities in the Underlying Index. The process is repeated, if necessary, to derive the final weights.</font></div>
<div>The modified market
        capitalization-weighting methodology is applied to the capitalization of each security, using the Last Sale Price of the security at the close of trading on the last trading day in February, May, August and November.
        Index Shares are then calculated by multiplying the weight of the security derived above by the new market value of the Underlying Index and dividing the modified market capitalization for each security by its
        corresponding Last Sale Price. The changes are effective after trading on the third Friday in March, June, September and December.</div>
<div>In administering the Underlying
        Index, NASDAQ may, from time to time, exercise reasonable discretion as it deems appropriate in order to ensure the integrity of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The Underlying Index is calculated continuously and widely disseminated to major data vendors.</font></div>
<hr noshade="noshade"/>
<div><sup>1</sup><font> For purposes of this document, “Last Sale Price” refers to the following: For a security listed on NASDAQ, it is the last sale price on NASDAQ, which normally would
        be the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (“NOCP”) when NASDAQ is closed. For any NYSE-listed or NYSE MKT-listed security, it is the last regular way trade reported on such security’s primary U.S. listing
        market. If a security does not trade on its primary listing market on a given day, the most recent last sale price from the primary listing market (adjusted for corporate actions, if any) is used.</font></div>

<div>The Russell Indexes</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.<font> The securities in the Russell indexes (sometimes referred to as the “components”) are reviewed and reconstituted annually, typically after the close on the last Friday in June
        to reflect changes in the marketplace. The Russell Top 200<sup>®</sup> Index, Russell 2000<sup>®</sup> Index and Russell 1000<sup>®</sup> Index are subsets of the Russell 3000<sup>®</sup> Index.</font></div>
<div>The Russell 3000<sup>®</sup> Index measures the performance of approximately the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the
        investable U.S. equity market. The Russell 3000<sup>®</sup> Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive, unbiased, and stable barometer of the broad market and is completely

<div>security’s price change is proportional to
        the issuer’s total market value, which is the share price times the number of shares available. Each Russell Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock
        rights, substitutions and other capital events.</div>
<div>Frank Russell Company uses a
        probability measure to assign stocks to the growth and value style indexes. The probability measure is used to indicate the degree of certainty that a stock is value or growth, based on three fundamental indicators:
        relative price-to-book (“PB”) ratio, Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System forecast medium-term growth (2 years) and sales per share historical growth (5 years). This method allows stocks to be
        represented as having both growth and value characteristics, while preserving the additive nature of the indexes. As a result, a stock may be a component of a Russell growth style index and also a component of the
        corresponding value style index, although the stock would likely have a different weight in each index.</div>
<div>Issue Changes.<font> Securities that leave the Russell Indexes between reconstitution dates are not replaced. Thus, the number of securities in the investments over the year will fluctuate according to
        corporate activity. When a stock is acquired, delisted or moves to the pink sheets or OTC bulletin boards, the stock is deleted from the relevant indexes.</font></div>
<div>When acquisitions or mergers take
        place, the stock’s capitalization moves to the acquiring stock, hence, mergers have no effect on index total capitalization if the acquiring stock is part of the index. The only additions between reconstitution
        dates are as a result of spin-offs and initial public offerings.</div>
<div>Issue Changes for the Focused Value
        Select Index.<font> The Focused Value Select Index will be reviewed monthly, with changes being implemented after the close of the 6<sup>th</sup> business day. Changes arising from review are announced after the close of the 4<sup>th</sup> business day.

        constituents. Thus, the number of securities in the investments over the year will fluctuate according to corporate activity.</div>
<div>Additions to the Parent Index will
        be considered for inclusion in the Underlying Index at the next review.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Maintaining the Russell indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price
        adjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs and quarterly initial public offerings. In addition, significant share capital changes are made at month-end. The divisor is adjusted for all changes in company market
        value to leave the value of the investments unaffected. All divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the closing value of the Russell indexes.</font></div>

<div>To determine constituents
        exhibiting prominent value characteristics, the Underlying Index uses a ‘sentiment’ screen. A sentiment score is calculated using estimates for earnings per share sourced from third party data providers.
        The sentiment score is calculated as follows:</div>
<div>(Number of
        upgrades for earnings per share for current and next fiscal year - Number of downgrades for earnings per share for current and next fiscal year)/ Total number of estimates for earnings per share for current and next

<div>The S&amp;P Indexes</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria for
        Domestic Indexes. <font>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC’s (“SPDJI”) various Index Committees are responsible for the overall management of SPDJI's indices (“S&amp;P DJI Indices”).
        Issuers (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the “components”) selected for the S&amp;P U.S. indexes represent a broad range of industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting universe of publicly traded U.S.
        issuers classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS<sup>®</sup>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited partnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding issuers, OTC
        bulletin board issues, pink sheet-listed issues, closed-end funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of each constituent must trade on
        either the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ. Additionally, only one share class per constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most
        liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share classes will have the classes combined for purposes of calculation of market capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s
        eligibility for inclusion in the S&amp;P Indexes: (i)</font></div>

<div>ownership of an issuer’s outstanding common
        stock, in order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the financial and operating condition of
        an issuer.</div>
<div>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are
        capitalization-weighted, based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the
        constituent’s share price. Issuers with float-adjusted market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion
        typically must be greater than the Index’s minimum market capitalization at the time it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s components are adjusted to reflect
        changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings,
        including private, corporate, and government holdings.</div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria for
        International Indexes. <font>Stocks are eligible for the S&amp;P Global Indices if they meet criteria for size, liquidity, profitability, and sector and market representation. Each of the S&amp;P Global Indices is
        balanced across country and sector weights in the region/market. The S&amp;P Global Indices begin with an eligible investable universe of stocks covering approximately 95% of each country’s total market
        capitalization. In some cases, the S&amp;P Global Indexes may include ADRs and GDRs. Stocks with relatively small market capitalization or insufficient liquidity are excluded by SPDJI. To identify a candidate pool for
        index constituent selection, all stocks are carefully examined using a set of general criteria. The specific securities are then screened for industry sector classification; thus, the eligible securities are ranked
        according to GICS. Then, the Index components, now determined, are weighted on the basis of SPDJI’s float-adjusted, market capitalization methodology. Generally, SPDJI observes a prospective constituent’s
        liquidity over a period of at least twelve months before consideration for inclusion. However, there may be extraordinary situations when issuers should be added immediately (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, certain privatizations). When a particular issuer dominates its home market, it may be excluded from an Index if analysis of the sectors reveals that its securities are not as liquid as
        those of similar issuers in other countries. Once a year, the float adjustments will be reviewed and potentially changed based on such review. The values of an Index’s components are adjusted to reflect changes
        in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. The market capitalization of index constituent issuers is adjusted for all strategic holdings, including
        private, corporate, and government holdings.</font></div>
<div>With respect to the non-U.S.
        components of the S&amp;P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of index components that are considered for inclusion are from the following S&amp;P DJI Indices: (i) the S&amp;P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock Exchange), which
        represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Canadian equities market; (ii) the S&amp;P/TOPIX 150 (TSE) which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly-listed issuers in
        the Japanese equities market; (iii) S&amp;P/ASX All-Australian 50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the Australian equities market; (iv) the S&amp;P Asia 50, which
        represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of four major equities markets in Asia (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore); (v) the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks from major
        sectors of the Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Chilé equity markets; and (vi) the S&amp;P Europe 350, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the region, covering
        approximately 70% of the region’s market capitalization.</div>
<div>Issue Changes. <font>General oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component
        investments, including additions and deletions to these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the various regional equity markets and, in
        some cases, with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements of index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective
        date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</font></div>
<div>Index Maintenance. <font>Maintaining the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price
        adjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs. An issuer will be removed from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as
        close as possible to the actual date on which the event occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no longer representative of its industry
        group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section criteria.</font></div>

<div>When calculating index weights,
        individual components’ shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also
        excluded regardless of whether they are index components. In countries with regulated environments, where a foreign investment limit exists at the sector or issuer level, the constituent’s weight will reflect
        either the foreign investment limit or the percentage float, whichever is the more restrictive.</div>
<div>Each issuer’s financial
        statements will be used to update the major shareholders’ ownership. However, during the course of the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (“IWF”) which is
        SPDJI’s term for the mathematical float factor used to calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (<font>i.e.</font>, privatization, merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than 5%, a float adjustment will be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.</div>
<div>Changes in the number of shares
        outstanding driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less than 5%
        are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday near the end of the calendar quarter. Generally, index changes due to rebalancing are announced two days before the effective date by way of a news release
        posted on <font>www.us.spindices.com.</font></div>
<div>Index Availability.<font> The S&amp;P Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</font></div>
<div>Exchange Rates. <font>SPDJI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time for the following funds: iShares Europe ETF, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded
        Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares Global 100 ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, iShares Global
        Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares Global Industrials ETF, iShares Global Utilities ETF, iShares North American Natural Resources ETF and iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF. Prior to
        January 31, 2013, SPDJI used the currency exchange (FX) rate corresponding to 5:15 p.m. Eastern time. In case World Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day
        and New Year’s Day), the previous business day’s rates are normally used. SPDJI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. SPDJI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use
        alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters rates are not available, or if SPDJI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances for a given currency
        on a particular day.</font></div>

<div>The Underlying Index uses a capping
        methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single issuer to a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers
        that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum of 50% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the
        Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the index weight to maximum
        of 45.00%. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI may consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there is reasonable evidence of common control.</div>

<div>is included in the Underlying Index, the removal
        criteria listed below are used to test its continuing eligibility as opposed to the exclusion factors listed above.</div>
<div>All additions to the Underlying
        Index are made on a quarterly rebalancing date, and there are no intra-quarter additions made to the Underlying Index. Inclusion in the Underlying Index is limited to issues whose indicated dividend yield is greater
        than or equal to 1% and less than or equal to 20%. In addition, for initial inclusion eligibility, each individual issue must be a preferred stock which has traded an average of 250,000 shares per month over the
        previous six months, as of the rebalancing reference date. Issues with fewer than six months of trading history are evaluated over the available period and may be included should size and available trading history
        infers the issue satisfies this requirement.</div>
<div>Preferred stocks are removed from
        the Underlying Index on a quarterly rebalancing date if they: (i) have an outstanding market capitalization of less than $100 million; (ii) have a six-month average monthly trading volume of less than 100,000 shares
        and have been a component of the Index for at least 12 months; or (iii) have an undetermined indicated dividend yield or an indicated dividend yield of less than 1% or greater than 20%.</div>
<div>Share changes for existing
        Underlying Index components occur semiannually in January and July. The data reference date for additions to and deletions from the Underlying Index is the last trading date of the month immediately preceding the
        rebalancing month. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis; and changes are effective after the close of trading on the third Friday of January, April, July and October. The Underlying Index is
        calculated with a capped market capitalization weighting scheme, with modifications being made to Underlying Index shares to prevent single stock concentration. There is no limit to the number of lines of a single
        company’s preferred stock is allowed in the Underlying Index; however, a maximum weight of 10% is set per issuer. All eligible lines for an issuer are included in the Underlying Index and capped on a pro rata
        basis to a maximum of 4% individual stock cap. In addition, the weight of preferred stocks with trading volumes of less than 250,000 shares per month on average over the previous six months must not exceed 25% of the
        Underlying Index. For purposes of this limitation, S&amp;P defines a single issuer to include companies that are under common control or are guaranteed by the same entity which is also affiliated with such companies.
        In the event the market capitalization weight of an issuer would exceed 10% or an issue would exceed 4% of the Underlying Index, all other stock weights in the Underlying Index are increased proportionately to account
        for such difference.</div>
<div>A constituent is removed
        intra-quarter if it is called or undergoes mandatory conversion or redemption. Subject to market conditions, S&amp;P will provide clients with five-days advance notice of a deletion. Should an existing member of the
        Underlying Index delist during the five-day notification period, it is removed at the closing price from its last day of trading. The quarterly rebalancing also results in deletions if constituents no longer meet
        continued eligibility requirements.</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of
        25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of
        concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit
        investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies,
        instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry.
        There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their activities are primarily
        related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to a Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any
        one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad
        authority to a Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to
        borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the
        Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s
        total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.”
        Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance
        with SEC staff guidance interpretations, when a Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting
        position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be interpreted to
        permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate
        or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to
        securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact,
        in the case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount
        of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed
        the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application
        of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving
        the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent
        permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental
        policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit
        funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral
        arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered
        loans.</div>

<div>iShares Focused Value Factor ETF,
        iShares Russell 1000 Pure U.S. Revenue ETF and iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF Only</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund’s Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</div>
<div>All Funds Other Than the iShares
        Focused Value Factor ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Pure U.S. Revenue ETF and iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940
        Act, which currently limits each Fund's holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund's net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid investments, pursuant to the Liquidity Program.</div>
<div>If any percentage restriction
        described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that
        certain percentage limitations will be observed continuously in accordance with applicable law.</div>
<div>All Funds</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
        purposes, for all Funds other than the iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF, in component securities of the Underlying Index or in depositary receipts representing component securities in the Underlying Index, and for the
        iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF, in component securities of its Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such
        policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a
        non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered
        open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its
        shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</div>
<div>Unless otherwise indicated, all
        limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain
        securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable
        to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax consequences.</div>
<div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units
        are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such
        term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a
        distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm
        or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it
        chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act
        must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete
        description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also
        note that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is

        pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by

<div>Trustees and Officers. <font> The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each
        Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or
        removal. Trustees who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (“Independent Trustees”).</font></div>
<div>The registered investment companies
        advised by BFA or its affiliates (the “BlackRock-advised Funds”) are organized into one complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds (the “BlackRock Multi-Asset

        a “BlackRock Fund Complex”). Each Fund is included in the BlackRock Fund Complex referred to as the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee of
        iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists of 360 funds as of August 1, 2019. With the exception of Robert S. Kapito, Salim Ramji and
        Charles Park, the address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito, Mr. Ramji and Mr. Park is c/o BlackRock, Inc., Park Avenue Plaza, 55

<div><font>Board – Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for
        oversight of the Funds rests with the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds
        in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees.
        The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that
        may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an
        Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees
        generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance
        Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the
        business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain
        specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers,
        officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The
        Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board
        to exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with
        respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment,
        compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not
        possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and
        operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are
        specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate
        risks, including</div>

<div>
<div>investment, operational, counterparty credit and
        enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board,
        directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and
        management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties,
        and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates)
        assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and
        BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA
        and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts
        risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</div>

<div>Potential Conflicts of Interest.
        <font> The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”), through a subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock, Inc., the parent of BFA, the Funds' investment
        adviser. Certain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to in this section as “BlackRock”) and PNC and its subsidiaries (collectively
        referred to in this section as the “Entities”), and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities, may give rise to
        actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's
        largest asset management firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective subsidiaries and each of their respective
        directors, officers and employees, including, in the case of BlackRock, the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged
        worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds.
        These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential
        multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities have
        proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those
        of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock and the Entities are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and
        fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock and the Entities are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities,
        currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact
        on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more
        or less favorable than those obtained by the Funds.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or
        sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases,
        this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or the Entities may have the
        effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies.
        This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock
        implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could
        result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases,
        elect to</div>

<div>implement internal policies and procedures
        designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div>
<div>Conflicts may also arise because
        portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security
        sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held
        by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds
        that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and redemptions, and increased remuneration and
        profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances,
        BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients
        (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There
        may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially
        conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable
        rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities and
        their respective clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity
        and terms of a Fund's investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or the Entities or their respective clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms
        that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s
        investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages
        or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a
        Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also
        possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be
        restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Entities or other
        accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or an Entity for clients worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and the Entities designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for
        example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Entities are performing services or when
        position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock or one or more Entities for their proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities
        for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management
        of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a
        Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or
        strategies used for other accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The
        proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed
        by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in
        investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment</div>

<div>
<div>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to
        BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and
        certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such
        other business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into
        transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or an Entity, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or an Entity,
        serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund
        obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or an Entity.</div>
<div>BlackRock or one or more Entities
        may also create, write or issue derivatives for their clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. BlackRock has
        entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares
        funds. BlackRock will receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include
        payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could
        contribute to the viability of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such
        derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable
        law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock or one or more Entities and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock or an Entity where such
        other clients have interests adverse to those of the Fund.</div>
<div>At times, these activities may
        cause business units or entities within BlackRock or an Entity to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted,
        a Fund will deal with BlackRock and/or Entities on an arm’s-length basis.</div>
<div>To the extent authorized by
        applicable law, BlackRock or one or more Entities may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,
        financial advisory fees, underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock or an Entity
        will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock and each Entity, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock or the Entity
        and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds also may use an index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker,
        dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law,
        BlackRock and the Entities (and their personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent,
        lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by
        reason of receipt by BlackRock or an Entity of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock or an Entity acts as
        broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock or the Entity may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund
        will be required to establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's
        establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>

<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant
        to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash
        collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to
        increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending
        agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients
        with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate pro rata allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending
        program, BlackRock indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar
        exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA
        also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific
        credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using
        loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may further adjust other securities lending program attributes
        by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending activity BlackRock may conduct
        at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined
        systematic process in order to approximate pro rata allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program
        limits (<font>i.e.,</font> indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending
        portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending
        opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes
        for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by the firm.</div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities
        and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different
        research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or
        aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity
        frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or
        credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same
        commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law,
        BlackRock may select brokers (including, without limitation, certain Entities) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with
        research or other appropriate services which provide, in BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and
        OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy
        analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds
        and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and
        services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client accounts. For example,
        research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In</div>

<div>addition, other BlackRock client accounts may
        receive the benefit, including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client
        accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</div>
<div>BlackRock does not currently enter
        into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a
        particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by
        client commissions that also will be used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law,
        may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are
        useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also
        enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where permitted, an Entity, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the
        commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft
        dollars may exist.</div>
<div>BlackRock may utilize certain
        electronic crossing networks (“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or an Entity has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing
        client securities transactions for certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions
        or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even
        though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by
        BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and
        procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in
        accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the
        interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or an Entity, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more
        detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div>
<div>It is also possible that, from time
        to time, BlackRock or an Entity may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification
        and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the Entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in
        Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or an Entity could
        significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing
        requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other shareholders in deciding whether to redeem its shares but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may
        invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies with which an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or an
        Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests or in which an Entity makes a market. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is
        compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies to which an Entity provides or may
        in the future provide research coverage. Such investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other clients of BlackRock or an Entity. In making
        investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the
        activities of BlackRock or an Entity may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. When an Entity</div>

        in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock or of an Entity have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited
        (“Chubb”), a public company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has
        approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages
        the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain
        BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co transaction.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities, their
        personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and the Entities and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to
        services to and sales of the Funds or other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock
        and the Entities and their sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also
        benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock or the Entities and such
        personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service
        providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered
        representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to
        BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation
        assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or
        investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally
        communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to
        a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in
        the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable,
        a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund
        might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to
        receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at
        the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an
        asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair
        values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued by BlackRock (pursuant
        to Board-adopted procedures) at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to
        services for which it receives an asset-based fee.</div>
<div>To the extent permitted by
        applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a
        Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional

<div>BlackRock and its directors,
        officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading
        and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the
        possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities
        trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting
        BlackRock or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div>
<div>BlackRock will not purchase
        securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are
        affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in
        circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security
        or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with,
        limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or
        recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock or an Entity is performing investment
        banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from
        or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of
        which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information
        barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Entity, or are the subject of an advisory or
        risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of
        BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by
        companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other
        derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
        license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>If certain aggregate ownership
        thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of
        investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases,
        sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its
        sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where
        ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and
        investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities
        nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases
        in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable
        to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be</div>

        applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other
        ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with
        respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an
        Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div>
<div>BlackRock may maintain securities
        indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices
        also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name.
        BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to any Fund and the Funds are under
        no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms
        offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described
        in “Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating
        expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees
        when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that
        BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be
        beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or
        reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into
        contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall relationship with
        such service providers. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions may accrue, in whole or in part,
        to BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership
        interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision
        of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates
        BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an
        arrangement with Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) to be one of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry
        platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development partner, BlackRock has licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. Once the ICE Platform is
        launched, BlackRock intends to use the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad
        adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s intellectual property to ICE and for
        BlackRock’s role as development partner. ICE Data Services, the underlying index provider for certain BFA managed funds, is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees
        from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>A Fund from time to time may

<div>mortgage-related securities containing loans or
        mortgages originated by PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) or its affiliates. It is possible that under some circumstances, PNC Mortgage, Midland or other affiliates could have interests that are
        in conflict with the holders of these mortgage-backed securities, and such holders could have rights against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates. For example, if PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates engaged
        in negligence or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties as a master servicer, then any holder of the mortgage-backed security could seek recourse against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as
        applicable. Also, as a master servicer, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may make certain representations and warranties regarding the quality of the mortgages and properties underlying a mortgage-backed
        security. If one or more of those representations or warranties is false, then the holders of the mortgage backed securities could trigger an obligation of PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable, to
        repurchase the mortgages from the issuing trust. Finally, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may own securities that are subordinate to the senior mortgage-backed securities owned by a Fund.</div>

<div>Legal Proceedings.<font>  On June 16, 2016, investors (the “Plaintiffs”) in certain iShares funds (iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P 500
        ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares Select Dividend ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF, iShares
        Preferred and Income Securities ETF and iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF) filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Trust, BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its advisory affiliates, and certain
        directors/trustees and officers of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”) in California State Court. The lawsuit alleges the Defendants violated federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose in
        the prospectuses issued by the funds noted above the risks of using stop-loss orders in the event of a “flash crash,” such as the one that occurred on May 6, 2010. On September 18, 2017, the court issued a
        Statement of Decision holding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims. On October 11, 2017, the court entered final judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice. In an opinion
        dated January 23, 2020, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims. On March 3, 2020, plaintiffs filed a petition for review by the California Supreme Court. On May 27, 2020, the California Supreme Court denied Plaintiff’s petition for review. Plaintiff may choose to petition the US Supreme Court for further review.</font></div>
<div>Investment Advisory,

<div>Investment Adviser. <font> BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation
        indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the
        Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and
        providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory
        agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment
        advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent
        permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the
        investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the
        Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including
        brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</div>

<div>
<div>BFA has entered into an investment
        sub-advisory agreement (the “Sub-Advisory Agreement” and together with the Investment Advisory Agreement, the “Advisory Agreements”) with the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is an investment
        adviser located in the U.K. The Sub-Adviser is an affiliate of BFA and is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in 1999.</div>
<div>Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement,
        subject to the supervision and oversight of the Board and BFA, the Sub-Adviser will be primarily responsible for execution of securities transactions outside the U.S. and Canada and may, from time to time, participate
        in the management of specified assets in the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Sub-Advisory
        Agreement, BFA pays the Sub-Adviser for services it provides either: (i) a fee equal to a percentage of the management fee paid to BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement, or (ii) an amount based on the cost of
        the services provided. If the Sub-Adviser provides services related to both portfolio management and trading it is entitled to receive, from BFA, an amount equal to 20% of BFA’s management fee, and if the
        Sub-Adviser provides services related solely to trading then it is entitled to receive, from BFA, an amount equal to 110% of the actual pre-tax costs incurred by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may be responsible for
        the day-to-day management of the Fund or portions of the Fund.</div>
<div>Unless earlier terminated as
        described below, each Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for an initial two year period and from year to year if approved annually (i) by the Board or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
        of the Fund, and (ii) by a majority of the Trustees who are not parties to such agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party.</div>
<div>Each Advisory Agreement with
        respect to each Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60 days' notice, by the Board or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940
        Act). The Investment Advisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60 days' notice by BFA. The Sub-Advisory Agreement is also terminable on 60 days' written notice at the option of either BFA or the Sub-Adviser.
        Each Advisory Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers. <font> As of March 31, 2019, the individuals named as Portfolio Managers in the Funds' Prospectuses were also primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of other iShares funds and

<div>Each of the portfolios or accounts
        for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management seeks to track the rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics of independent third-party indexes by either
        replicating the same combination of securities and other financial instruments that constitute those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that constitute those
        indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to BFA’s policy, investment opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain
        circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal constraints or other factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those
        portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time each Fund may receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than they would have if
        the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other
        portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory
        services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or
        account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio’s or account’s gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the
        case if BFA or any of its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate
        more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and each of its affiliates have an
        obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intend to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and accounts managed by
        an investment adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict of interest, which may result in the Portfolio
        Managers favoring those portfolios or accounts with performance-based fee arrangements.</div>
<div>The tables below show, for each
        Portfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or accounts of the types set forth in the above tables and the aggregate of total assets in those portfolios or accounts with respect to which the investment management fees
        are based on the performance of those portfolios or accounts as of March 31, 2019:</div>

<div>Portfolio Manager Compensation
        Overview</div>
<div>The discussion below describes the
        Portfolio Managers' compensation as of March 31, 2019.</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial
        arrangements with its portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of
        components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits
        programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div>
<div>Base compensation.<font> Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.</font></div>
<div>Discretionary Incentive
        Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, Inc.,
        the investment performance, including risk-adjusted returns, of the firm’s assets under management or supervision by that portfolio manager relative to predetermined benchmarks, and the individual’s
        performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock, Inc. Performance is generally assessed over trailing 1-, 3- and 5-year periods relative to benchmarks plus an alpha target as
        well as against peer groups. In most cases, benchmarks are the same as the benchmark or benchmarks against which the performance of the Funds or other accounts managed by the portfolio managers are measured. Among
        other things, BlackRock, Inc.’s Chief Investment Officers make a subjective determination with respect to each portfolio manager’s compensation based on the performance of the Funds and other accounts
        managed by each portfolio manager relative to the various benchmarks. With respect to these portfolio managers in relation</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>to these portfolios, the benchmarks for the Funds
        and other accounts are: a combination of S&amp;P 500 Index, FTSE World ex-US Index, ICE BofAML Current 5-Year U.S. Treasury Index and FTSE Non-U.S. Dollar World Government Bond Index.</div>
<div>Distribution of Discretionary
        Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash, deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards, and/or deferred cash awards that notionally track
        the return of certain BlackRock, Inc. investment products.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio managers receive their
        annual discretionary incentive compensation in the form of cash. Portfolio managers whose total compensation is above a specified threshold also receive deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards annually as part of their
        discretionary incentive compensation. Paying a portion of discretionary incentive compensation in the form of deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given year “at
        risk” based on BlackRock, Inc.’s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to certain key employees as part
        of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term shareholders and motivate performance. Deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards are generally granted in the form of BlackRock, Inc.
        restricted stock units that vest pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan and, once vested, settle in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. The portfolio managers of the Funds have deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock
        awards.</div>
<div>For certain portfolio managers, a
        portion of the discretionary incentive compensation is also distributed in the form of deferred cash awards that notionally track the returns of select BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which provides
        direct alignment of portfolio manager discretionary incentive compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards vest ratably over a number of years and, once vested, settle in the form of cash. Only
        portfolio managers who manage specified products and whose total compensation is above a specified threshold are eligible to participate in the deferred cash award program.</div>
<div>Other Compensation Benefits.<font> In addition to base salary and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:</font></div>
<div>Incentive Savings Plans<font> — BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock, Inc. employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement
        Savings Plan (“RSP”), and the BlackRock Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible
        pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) limit ($280,000 for
        2019). The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies and collective investment funds managed by the firm. BlackRock, Inc. contributions follow the investment direction set by
        participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into a target date fund that corresponds to, or is closest to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The
        ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock, Inc. common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to the purchase of 1,000 shares of
        common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the Purchase Date. All of the portfolio managers of the Funds are eligible to participate in these plans.</font></div>
<div>As of March 31, 2019, the Portfolio
        Managers beneficially owned shares of the Funds, for which they are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management, in the amounts reflected in the following tables:</div>

<div>Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under
        the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a
        broker-dealer in all 50 U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each
        Fund provides that it may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees,
        or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined
        in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into
        agreements with securities dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC
        participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from
        time to time and from its own resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the
        Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the
        securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the
        reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational
        costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the
        “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees a Fund bears to an annual
        rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending
        Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) all
        Funds except for the iShares Europe ETF, iShares Global 100 ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares Global Comm Services ETF, iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF,
        iShares Global Energy ETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares Global Healthcare ETF, iShares Global Industrials ETF, iShares Global Infrastructure ETF, iShares Global Utilities ETF, iShares International Developed
        Property ETF, iShares International Preferred Stock ETF and iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF (“Domestic Equity Funds”) retained 71.5% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and
        (ii) this amount could never be less than 65% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Through December 31, 2019, (i) domestic equity funds, such as the Domestic Equity Funds, retained
        73.5% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Effective
        January 1, 2020, (i) the iShares domestic equity funds, such as the Domestic Equity Funds, retain 75% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less
        than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) the

<div>Under the securities lending
        program, the Funds are categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of
        which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the
        business day following the date that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under
        “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable Fund, pursuant to the securities lending agreement, will receive for the remainder of
        that calendar year securities lending income as follows:</div>
<div>Domestic Equity Funds</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) 75%
        of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 65% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Effective January 1,
        2019, (i) 80% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of the securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>International Equity Funds</div>
<div>(i) 85% of securities lending
        income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds
        by BTC in the most recent fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting
        borrowers from an approved list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating
        the terms of securities loans, including the amount of fees; </div>
<div>(3) directing
        the delivery of loaned securities; </div>
<div>(4) monitoring
        the daily value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of excess collateral, as necessary; </div>
<div>(5) investing
        cash collateral received in connection with any loaned securities; </div>
<div>(6) monitoring
        distributions on loaned securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </div>
<div>(7) in the event
        of default by a borrower with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that
        of the loaned securities; and </div>
<div>(8) terminating
        securities loans and arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan termination.</div>

        dollar amounts of income and fees/compensation related to the securities lending activities of each Fund during its most recent fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.</div>

<div>Payments by BFA and its
        Affiliates.<font>  BFA and/or its affiliates (“BFA Entities”) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries
        (“Intermediaries”) for certain activities related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of
        the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price
        paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that
        are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities,
        such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities
        also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing Costs”). In
        addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise
        promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or
        other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are
        sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</font></div>

<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be
        significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an
        Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to
        receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded
        products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her
        Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments
        described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to
        Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds,
        exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities
        have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this
        relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”),
        FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in
        advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket
        charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain
        brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing
        Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter
        into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may
        include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made
        pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain
        minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Charles Schwab &amp; Co.,
        Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., E*Trade Securities LLC, FDx Advisors, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith
        Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Advisors Services, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services
        Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the
        date of this SAI are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make
        Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed above. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make
        payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds
        in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by
        BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any
        payments made, or financial incentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other
        exchange-traded products.</font></div>

<div>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and
        quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the
        securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will
        not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset
        Value</div>
<div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of securities held
        by a Fund is as follows:</font></div>
<div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each, an “Exchange”) are
        valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price on the Exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last
        traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an
        equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held
        by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures approved by the Board (the “Valuation Procedures”),
        BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments. <font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio
        securities using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each
        in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration
        of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally
        value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than
        institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method
        does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from independent third-party pricing services.
        Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the entity, establish a
        benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other
        Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on
        which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask
        (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless
        BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives
        are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each
        in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are
        traded on exchanges, are valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing
        service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information. <font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in
        thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the
        value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by
        technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div>All cash, receivables and current
        payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</div>
<div>Prices obtained from independent
        third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and
        liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally
        will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</div>
<div>In the event that application of
        the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or
        in accordance with a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including
        restricted securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a
        foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers.</div>
<div>Certain of the securities acquired
        by a Fund may be traded on foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized
        Participants can neither purchase nor redeem shares of a Fund.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S.
        securities, U.S. government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such
        securities used in computing the NAV of a Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>Use of fair value prices and
        certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between
        a Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Fair Value.<font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value
        Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BlackRock in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among
        other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source
        is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or
        where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event”
        is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s
        assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of the assets or liabilities held by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that
        occurs in global markets or in related or highly correlated assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, ADRs, GDRs or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the
        primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or
        other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset. In all cases, on days where
        non-U.S. securities markets are closed, BlackRock will determine the fair value of stocks traded on that local market, in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Fair value adjustments may be calculated by
        referring to instruments and markets that have continued to trade, such as ETFs, correlated stock market indices or index futures.</div>
<div>BlackRock, with input from the
        BlackRock Investment Strategy Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation
        Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers
        and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently
        reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a
        Fair Value Asset, the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability
        in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of
        extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or
        BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith
        approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset
        type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management
        pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or
        related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the
        fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the
        particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the
        effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited
        financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in
        Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring
        fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they
        invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become more
        stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity
        due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by
        the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks
        to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities
        of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission
        available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select
        a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge
        if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to
        execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security
        or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available;
        (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the
        broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and
        (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved
        in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act
        (“Section 28(e)”) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the
        amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on
        riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may
        purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA
        has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that
        available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div>
<div>The Funds anticipate that brokerage
        transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of
        depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like
        other securities traded in the U.S., will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</div>
<div>OTC issues, including most
        fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as
        brokers. The Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect
        to both foreign and domestic securities will generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time,
        and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons
        affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such
        transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and
        affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which
        BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market
        instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally
        traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect
        trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any
        commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>

<div>Securities purchased in
        underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an
        issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds
        and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment
        allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account;
        (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for
        accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover,
        investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one
        client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or
        benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates
        may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>Initial public offerings
        (“IPOs”) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or
        “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and
        equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with
        respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have
        indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international equity securities, the country where
        the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to
        share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such
        investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
        equitable to clients may be used as well.</div>
<div>Because different accounts may have
        differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts.
        For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one
        client of BFA or the other Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a
        security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of
        securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be
        made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find
        it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In
        general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each
        client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled at several different prices through multiple
        trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice could have
        a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it</div>

        effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an
        adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities
        will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the order.</div>
<div>The table below sets forth the
        brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s
        assets over those periods or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</div>

<div>The Funds' purchase and sale orders
        for securities may be combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts
        managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some
        cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume
        transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,
        from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these
        provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds will not deal with
        affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from
        year to year, as well as within a year. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses.</div>
<div>The table below sets forth the
        portfolio turnover rates of each Fund for the fiscal years noted:</div>

<div>
<div>Each share issued by a fund has a
        <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate
        equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with
        respect to matters upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote
        together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is
        not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act.
        All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the
        initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule
        0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by
        writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or
        other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated
        thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be
        subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their
        own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC staff.</div>
<div>In accordance with the Trust's
        current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable
        law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or
        a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances
        described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides
        that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to
        permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of
        cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for shareholders owning in
        excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for
        Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable
        electronic movement of securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central
        counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
        DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of
        directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or
        indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>

<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is
        limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are
        referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC
        Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their
        purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors
        to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices,
        statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a
        fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or
        indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant
        may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each
        such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</div>
<div>Share distributions shall be made
        to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with
        payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial
        Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered
        in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</div>
<div>The Trust has no responsibility or
        liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
        records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants
        and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging
        its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares. <font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors
        participating in the seeding may be Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all
        of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from
        time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div>
<div>Selling Shareholders may sell
        shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems,
        in the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated
        prices. These sales may be effected through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable
        law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any
        broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any
        other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</div>

<div>In its discretion, the Trust
        reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of
        any Fund, and to make a corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the
        range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with
        respect to each Fund is any day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as
        observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>
<div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally consists of the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit
        Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile
        similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is
        an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to
        compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit
        Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the
        NSCC on each Business Day prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number of shares of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included in
        the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units
        of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</div>

<div>The identity and number of shares
        of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the
        investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying
        Index.</div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to
        permit or require the substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not
        be eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or
        require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities
        or other local laws or in certain other situations. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method. <font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or
        specified for a Fund, they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the
        Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation
        Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Fund, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”), a clearing agency that is
        registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant
        Agreement”) (discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Fund,
        however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized
        Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor (an “Authorized
        Participant”). Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions,
        including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the net asset value of a Creation Unit is next
        determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an
        agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized
        Participant. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be
        placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to
        enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines
        regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to
        transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power
        of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div>
<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper
        form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide
        such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time
        to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be</font></div>

        Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit
        proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must
        also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next
        determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations
        department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that
        an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div>
<div>The Authorized Participant is
        responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase
        Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's
        NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
        Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders to create shares of a Fund that
        are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline specified
        above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or
        through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website
        maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as
        provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation
        Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii)
        arrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the
        Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth below.</font></div>
<div>Once a Fund has accepted an order,
        upon the next determination of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then
        transmit a confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div>
<div>Each Fund reserves the absolute
        right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of
        the currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would
        have certain adverse tax consequences to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA,
        have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii) circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The
        Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the
        sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure
        to give such notification.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>   Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash
        Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant
        sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are</font></div>

<div>generally issued on a “T+2 basis”
        (<font>i.e.</font>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period,
        if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, in order to accommodate
        non-U.S. market holiday schedules (as discussed in Appendix B of this SAI), to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (<font>i.e.</font>, the last day the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an
        Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part
        or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and
        maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with
        the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy Deposit Securities for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash
        collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the
        Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit
        Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to
        liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div>
<div>In certain cases, Authorized
        Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized
        Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility
        and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation
        Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction
        fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the
        applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,
        execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs).
        Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use
        the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>Redemption of iShares Russell 2000
        ETF During Certain Market Conditions.<font>  By submitting a redemption request, an Authorized Participant is deemed to represent to the Trust, consistent with the Authorized Participant Agreement, that (1) it has the
        requisite number of shares to deliver to the Trust to satisfy the redemption request, (2) such shares have not been loaned or pledged to any other party and are free and clear of any liens and encumbrances, and (3) it
        will not lend, hypothecate or otherwise encumber the shares after the submission of the redemption request. These deemed representations are subject to verification under certain circumstances with respect to the
        iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Specifically, if an Authorized Participant submits a redemption request with respect to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF on a Business Day on which the Trust determines, based on information
        available to the Trust on such Business Day, that (i) the short interest of the Fund in the marketplace is greater than or equal to 150% and (ii) the orders in the aggregate from all Authorized Participants redeeming
        Fund shares on such Business Day represent 25% or more of the shares outstanding of the Fund, such Authorized Participant will be required to verify to the Trust (in a form specified by the Trust) the accuracy of its
        deemed representations. If, after receiving notice of the verification requirement, the Authorized Participant does not verify the accuracy of its deemed representations in accordance with this requirement, its
        redemption request will be considered not to have been timely received in proper form.</font></div>
<div>Redemption of Creation Units. <font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the
        Distributor or its agent and only on a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary
        market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that
        could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund generally redeems
        Creation Units for Fund Securities (as defined below). Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the
        NSCC, prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange on each Business Day, the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be
        applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash
        Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the corresponding Cash Amount (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund
        until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to
        creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are
        available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the
        shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole
        discretion, substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including
        circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized
        Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash
        paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In</div>

<div>the event that the Fund Securities have a value
        greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally redeems Creation
        Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio
        of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>   Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available
        or specified for a Fund, they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of
        the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font></div>
<div>Costs Associated with Redemption
        Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is
        charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the applicable
        Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution,
        price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized
        Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances.
        Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>
<div>The following table sets forth each
        Fund's standard redemption transaction fees and maximum additional charge (as described above):</div>

<div>Placement of Redemption Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit
        an irrevocable request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund
        may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an
        Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must
        transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that

<div>Creation Units may have to be placed by the
        investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect.
        Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to
        permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect
        redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered
        to be in “proper form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be
        effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent
        from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly
        followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption
        request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities
        and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry
        system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant,
        whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any
        of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds
        are generally made within two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle deliveries of redemption proceeds on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if
        necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliance with applicable law. For example, certain Funds reserve the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 to accommodate non-U.S.
        market holiday schedules (as discussed in Appendix B of this SAI), to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (<font>i.e., </font>the last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain other circumstances. Appendix B of this SAI
        identifies the instances, if any, where more than seven days would be needed to deliver redemption proceeds for such Funds. Pursuant to an order of the SEC, for such Funds, the Trust will make delivery of redemption
        proceeds within the number of days stated in Appendix B of this SAI to be the maximum number of days necessary to deliver redemption proceeds.</div>
<div>If neither the redeeming Beneficial
        Owner nor the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible
        to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming
        Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund
        next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs associated
        with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise
        permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first registering
        the Fund Securities under such laws.</div>
<div>Although the Trust does not
        ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units, in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as
        practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter, except for the instances listed in Appendix B to this SAI in which more than seven calendar days would be needed).</div>

        Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation</div>

<div>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to
        10:00 a.m., Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by
        the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash, in U.S.
        dollars in immediately available funds, having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing shares. Such cash
        collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its Custodian on the day after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily.
        The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the
        Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement
        permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the
        value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of
        a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell
        shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be
        suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period
        during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities
        or determination of its net asset value is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div>
<div>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions
        of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the
        market value of the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any
        loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax
        laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year,
        or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div>
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of
        certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences
        that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to
        the specific U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI,
        all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Tax reform legislation commonly
        known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally
        effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and, without further legislation, will not apply after 2025. The application of certain
        provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on a Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. In addition, legislative, regulatory or
        administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on
        their investment in a Fund.</div>

<div>Regulated Investment Company
        Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually
        distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the
        following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities
        or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net
        income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their income from interest,
        dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be
        represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an
        amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's total assets may
        be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are
        engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div>
<div>A Fund may be able to cure a
        failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in
        any taxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be
        deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable income.</div>
<div>Although, in general, the passive
        loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in
        partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided
        that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable
        income” (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for
        the taxable year. A Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a
        RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions
        generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be
        treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net
        investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC
        in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the Fund may be
        required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it
        qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div>
<div>Excise Tax.<font>  A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for
        the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that
        is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by</font></div>

        must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare and

<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards.

<div>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.<font>   Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made.
        However, any dividend or distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been
        received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following
        calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute
        annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss
        carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it
        will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a)
        will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares
        of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be
        entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not
        subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund with the IRS.</div>
<div>Distributions of net realized
        long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the
        Fund. All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary
        income, subject to the discussion of qualified</div>

<div>dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are
        eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular
        dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in
        respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose
        is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or
        (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a
        Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital
        gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and
        profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal
        income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares
        received equal to such amount.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare
        contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and
        filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares
        just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may
        nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross
        income not as of the date received but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e.</font>, the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired such security. Accordingly, in
        order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the
        case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may,
        for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss
        (defined as the sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of
        post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized
        losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</div>
<div>Sales of Shares. <font> Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis
        in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s
        hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange
        will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially
        identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed
        loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
        distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</font></div>
<div>If a shareholder incurs a sales
        charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales
        charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken</div>

<div>into account in computing gain/loss on the
        original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same
        rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their
        investments within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has
        failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv)
        has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal
        income tax liability.</font></div>

        ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value
        of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more
        taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust
        determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share
        ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Certain
        Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S.
        currencies), to the extent permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among
        other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount
        and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay dividends or make distributions in
        amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries
        in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent
        disqualification of a Fund as a RIC.</font></div>
<div>A Fund’s investments in
        so-called “Section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special
        tax rules. All Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a
        Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a Fund from positions in
        Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets and were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the
        resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were
        actually held by a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap
        contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction.
        Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has
        been a party to the swap for more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under
        certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</div>

<div>Qualified Dividend Income. <font> Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income
        or as qualified dividend income, which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as
        qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, non-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of
        which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax
        treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus,
        the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico,
        Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,
        Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</font></div>
<div>A dividend from a Fund will not be
        treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before
        the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to
        the shareholder (or, in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend
        with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property;
        or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated as qualified
        dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and
        distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a
        direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% “qualified business income” deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and proposed regulations issued in January 2019, on which taxpayers may currently rely, permit a
        RIC to report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the dividends as such
        provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</div>
<div>Corporate Dividends Received
        Deduction.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for
        corporations. A 46-day minimum holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date
        for certain preference dividends) during which risk of loss may not be diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be eligible for the dividends received
        deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to the investment.</font></div>
<div>Excess Inclusion Income. <font> Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) from being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of
        Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to report
        some or all of its distributions as “excess inclusion income.” To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be
        tax-exempt such as individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be
        eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain “disqualified organizations,” as defined by the
        Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a
        100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Non-U.S. Investments. <font> Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or
        other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses)
        realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated.
        Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to
        fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless a Fund was to elect otherwise.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund may be subject to
        non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to “pass through” to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held
        the security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day
        holding period at the time of deemed distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their deductions on their
        personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s <font>pro rata</font> share of the Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by the Fund are not eligible for
        non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not “passed through” for tax purposes will not be available to shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year that the
        Fund elects to “pass through” its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S.
        federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of non-U.S.
        taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as
        U.S.-source income. Certain limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the
        ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to shares of a
        Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div>
<div>Passive Foreign Investment
        Companies. <font> If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares
        even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on a Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such
        distributions or gains.</font></div>
<div>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC
        and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the
        ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In
        order to make this election, a Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if
        adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to the Fund.</div>
<div>Alternatively, a Fund may make a
        mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and would
        deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable
        years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year
        may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to distribute this “phantom” income and gain to
        satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>A Fund will make the appropriate
        tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effects of these rules.</div>

<div>Reporting. <font> If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the
        shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance,
        shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders
        should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font></div>
<div>Other Taxes. <font> Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular
        situation.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders.
        <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent
        derived from investment income and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a
        reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to
        regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
        U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may
        also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable
        form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are
        generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than
        certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are
        paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable
        year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat
        such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification
        requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may
        withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
        rules to their accounts.</div>
<div>Distributions to certain foreign
        shareholders by a Fund at least 50% of the assets of which are “U.S. real property interests” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations) at any time during the five-year period
        ending on the date of the distributions, to the extent the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding
        corporations” such as certain REITs, although exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of
        such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distributions), generally must be treated by such foreign shareholders as income effectively connected to a trade or business
        within the U.S., which is generally subject to tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, except for distributions to foreign shareholders that held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund
        at any time during the previous one-year period ending on the date of the distributions. Such distributions may be subject to U.S. withholding tax and may require a foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income
        tax return. In addition, sales or redemptions of shares held by certain foreign shareholders in such a Fund generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax and generally will require the foreign shareholder to file
        a U.S. federal income tax return, although exceptions may apply if more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s shares are held by U.S. shareholders or the foreign shareholder selling or redeeming the shares has
        held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or redemption.</div>
<div>Provided that more than 50% of the
        value of a Fund’s stock is held by U.S. shareholders, redemptions and other distributions made in the form of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding
        corporations”, although exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at

        bases in such interests and (ii) the greatest foreign ownership percentage of the Fund during the five-year period ending on the date of distribution.</div>

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax

        information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid
        withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification
        numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts
        maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information
        concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign
        entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

        Investment Fund Managers Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative
        Provisions”). These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency
        obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure
        Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with
        known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of “depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on
        the marketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is
        sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an
        ongoing basis of certain information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar
        liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however,
        to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if
        any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA has registered the following
        Funds for marketing to investors in Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</div>
<div>iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF<br/>

<div>Investors’ Rights. <font> Each Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, administrator, custodian and transfer agent. Further information about the duties
        and roles of these service providers is set out in this SAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund are not parties to the relevant agreement with these service providers and do not have express contractual rights
        against the Fund or its service providers, except certain institutional investors that are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under the terms of the
        relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under federal or state law against a Fund or its service providers. In the event that an investor considers that it may have a claim
        against a Fund, or against any service provider in connection with its investment in a Fund, such investor should consult its own legal advisor.</font></div>
<div>By contract, Authorized
        Participants irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or U.S. federal court sitting in New York City over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Authorized
        Participant Agreement. Jurisdiction over other claims, whether by investors or Authorized Participants, will turn on the facts of the particular case and the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is
        brought.</div>

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock helps investors build
        better financial futures. As a fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and
        individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other
        financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world.</div>
<div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE
        GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock’s Investment
        Stewardship activities are focused on protecting and enhancing the economic value of the companies in which we invest on behalf of clients. We do this through engagement with boards and management of investee
        companies and, for those clients who have given us authority, through voting at shareholder meetings.</div>
<div>We believe that there are certain
        fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best
        interests. Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment
        of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment including but not limited to changes to the purpose
        of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely
        information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the
        performance of the board of directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and
        managed. The board should provide direction and leadership to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on
        shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal
        that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case
        basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our
        approach to engaging with companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary
        internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate
        governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific assessments.</div>
<div>We believe BlackRock has a
        responsibility in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on
        corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of shareholders and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long-term
        shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s
        oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a team profile on our website.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT
        AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted
        standards of corporate governance differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship
        activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of
        long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific
        resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div>

</div>
<div>At a minimum, we expect companies
        to observe the accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach
        taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform
        independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long-term economic
        interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external research.</div>
<div>BlackRock views engagement as an
        important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of investee companies and their governance structures to better inform our voting decisions. Engagement also allows us to
        share our philosophy and approach to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures,
        particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock takes an engagement-first
        approach, emphasizing direct dialogue with companies on governance issues that have a material impact on financial performance. We generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give
        management time to address or resolve the issue. As a long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue and develop mutual understanding of governance
        matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them constructively and
        privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies, or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and
        listen to companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek to engage at the company, which could be management
        representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is
        critical to the economic success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company.
        For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to
        promote and protect shareholder interests by:</div>

</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the
        operation of the board is enhanced when there is a clearly independent, senior non-executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director.
        The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent
        participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains
        effective, regular reviews of board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto
        the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple
        dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The
        board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we
        would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the
        board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of
        fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to
        decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a significant adverse event.</div>
<div>Auditors and audit-related issues</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical
        importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the
        management of the audit function. We take particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial
        statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit
        firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the
        auditor.</div>
<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset
        sales and other special transactions</div>
<div>The capital structure of a company
        is critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a
        key protection for shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</div>

<div>
<div>Effective voting rights are central
        to the rights of ownership and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in
        protecting company value, and voting power should match economic exposure.</div>
<div>We are concerned that the creation
        of a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share,
        one vote principle is designed to mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such
        companies should review these dual-class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a
        management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures
        at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales
        or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale
        behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it enhances long-term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have
        been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to
        place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to
        be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that
        shareholders have a right to dispose of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are
        contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own
        best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s
        board of directors to put in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder
        returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that
        their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate
        existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there
        should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge
        that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking
        rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on
        long-term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual
        performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and
        other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div>
<div>Non-executive directors should be
        compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their
        independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>

<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>It is within this context of our
        fiduciary duty to clients that we undertake our investment stewardship activities. Sound practices in relation to the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors inherent in the business model
        can be a signal of operational excellence and management quality.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to
        identify and report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the
        interests of shareholders and protects and enhances the long-term economic value of the company. E&amp;S factors are material if they are core to how the business operates. The key performance indicators in relation
        to E&amp;S factors should also be disclosed and performance against them discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps shareholders assess how well management is
        dealing with the material E&amp;S factors relevant to the business. Any generally recognized best practices and reporting standards adopted by the company should also be discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to
        make social or political judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee
        companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where local laws or regulations that significantly impact the
        company’s operations are contradictory or ambiguous to global norms.</div>
<div>Given that E&amp;S factors are
        often not issues on which a shareholder votes, we will engage directly with the board or management. Engagement on a particular E&amp;S factor is based on our assessment that there are potential material economic
        ramifications for shareholders over the long-term.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of
        directors where we have concerns that a company might not be dealing with material E&amp;S factors appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there
        seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will assess whether the company
        has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern and whether there is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company if the issue is not addressed.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters
        and shareholder protections</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that
        shareholders have a right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance
        structures in place and the rights of shareholders to influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality
        of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the
        shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS
        INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES</div>
<div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high
        standard in our investment stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who
        do not have other responsibilities other than their roles in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional
        advisory committees (“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock
        investment professionals and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within
        each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>In addition to the regional
        Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock
        investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary
        oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global
        Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the
        regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee
        receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews
        these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with
        companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate
        governance issues and participates in industry discussions to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and
        performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate
        regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies
        submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have
        voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the
        proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management
        policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights,
        BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market
        practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that
        the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of
        there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the
        particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting
        involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of
        shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share-blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their
        voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and
        (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as shareblocking or overly
        burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes
        proxies on a “best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to
        opportunity costs associated with shareblocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div>

<div>Portfolio managers have full
        discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item. Portfolio managers may from time to time reach differing views on how best to maximize
        economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from one another. However, because
        BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform manner.</div>

                    reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived

<div>
<div>These guidelines should be read in
        conjunction with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship <font>Global Corporate Governance Guidelines &amp; Engagement Principles.</font></div>
<div>INTRODUCTION</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc. and its
        subsidiaries (collectively, “BlackRock”) seek to make proxy voting decisions in the manner most likely to protect and enhance the economic value of the securities held in client accounts. The following
        issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the “Guidelines”) are intended to summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s general philosophy and approach to corporate governance issues that most
        commonly arise in proxy voting for U.S. securities. These Guidelines are not intended to limit the analysis of individual issues at specific companies and are not intended to provide a guide to how BlackRock will vote
        in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots , as well as our
        expectations of boards of directors. They are applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company and the individual ballot item.</div>
<div>VOTING GUIDELINES</div>
<div>These guidelines are divided into
        eight key themes which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of annual and extraordinary meetings of shareholders:</div>

<div>BOARDS AND DIRECTORS</div>
<div>Director elections</div>
<div>In general, BlackRock supports the
        election of directors as recommended by the board in uncontested elections. However, we believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held account able. We may
        withhold votes from directors or members of particular board committees in certain situations, as indicated below .</div>
<div>Independence</div>
<div>We expect a majority of the
        directors on the board to be independent. In addition, all members of key committees, including audit, compensation, and nominating / governance committees, should be independent. Our view of independence may vary
        slightly from listing standards.</div>
<div>In particular, common impediments
        to independence in the U.S. may include:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>•

<td>An equity ownership in the company in excess of 20%
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Having any other interest, business, or relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to
                    act in the best interests of the company
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>We may vote against directors
        serving on key committees that we do not consider to be independent.</div>
<div>When evaluating controlled
        companies, as defined by the U.S. stock exchanges, we will only vote against insiders or affiliates who sit on the audit committee, but not other key committees.</div>

<div>Oversight</div>
<div>We expect the board to exercise
        appropriate oversight over management and business activities of the company. We will consider voting against committee members and / or individual directors in the following circumstances:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Where the board has failed to exercise oversight with regard to accounting practices or audit oversight, we will consider voting against the current audit committee, and any other
                    members of the board who may be responsible. For example, this may apply to members of the audit committee during a period when the board failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing if substantial accounting
                    irregularities suggest insufficient oversight by that committee
                    </td>

                    a majority of independent directors. However, this would not apply in the case of a controlled company

</tr>

                    recent election of directors have received withhold votes from more than 30% of shares voted and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder concerns. This may not apply in cases where
                    BlackRock did not support the initial withhold vote
                    </td>

<td>The independent chair or lead independent director and / or members of the nominating / governance committee, where a board fails to implement shareholder
                    proposals that receive a majority of votes cast at a prior shareholder meeting, and the proposals, in our view, have a direct and substantial impact on shareholders’ fundamental rights or long-term economic

<div>Board composition and
        effectiveness</div>
<div>We encourage boards to periodically
        renew their membership to ensure relevant skills and experience within the boardroom. To this end, regular performance reviews and skills assessments should be conducted by the nominating / governance committee.</div>
<div>Furthermore, we expect boards to be
        comprised of a diverse selection of individuals who bring their personal and professional experiences to bear in order to create a constructive debate of competing views and opinions in the boardroom. We recognize
        that diversity has multiple dimensions. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the full breadth of diversity including personal factors, such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
        as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. In addition to other elements of diversity, we encourage companies to have at least two women directors

<div>We encourage boards to disclose
        their views on:</div>

</div>
<div>While we support regular board
        refreshment, we are not opposed in principle to long-tenured directors, nor do we believe that long board tenure is necessarily an impediment to director independence. A variety of director tenures within the
        boardroom can be beneficial to ensure board quality and continuity of experience.</div>
<div>Our primary concern is that board
        members are able to contribute effectively as corporate strategy evolves and business conditions change, and that all directors, regardless of tenure, demonstrate appropriate responsiveness to shareholders. We
        acknowledge that no single person can be expected to bring all relevant skill sets to a board; at the same time, we generally do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to have any particular director on the board
        solely by virtue of a singular background or specific area of expertise.</div>
<div>Where boards find that age limits
        or term limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits.</div>
<div>To the extent that we believe that
        a company has not adequately accounted for diversity in its board composition within a reasonable timeframe, we may vote against the nominating / governance committee for an apparent lack of commitment to board
        effectiveness.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Board size</div>
<div>We typically defer to the board in
        setting the appropriate size and believe directors are generally in the best position to assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may oppose boards that appear too small to allow for
        effective shareholder representation or too large to function efficiently.</div>
<div>CEO and management succession
        planning</div>
<div>There should be a robust CEO and
        senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. We expect succession planning to cover both long-term planning consistent with the strategic direction of
        the company and identified leadership needs over time, as well as short-term planning in the event of an unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain its executive succession planning
        process, including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information commonly associated with this exercise.</div>
<div>Classified board of directors /
        staggered terms</div>
<div>We believe that directors should be
        re-elected annually and that classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals
        requesting board de-classification, we may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure, such as when a company needs consistency and stability
        during a time of transition, e.g. newly public companies or companies undergoing a strategic restructuring. A classified board structure may also be justified at non-operating companies in certain circumstances. We
        would, however, expect boards with a classified structure to periodically review the rationale for such structure and consider when annual elections might be appropriate.</div>
<div>Without a voting mechanism to
        immediately address concerns of a specific director, we may choose to vote against or withhold votes from the available slate of directors by default (see “Shareholder rights” for additional detail).</div>
<div>Contested director elections</div>
<div>The details of contested elections,
        or proxy contests, are assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, which may include: the qualifications of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the concerns identified by
        the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the likelihood that the dissident’s solutions will produce the desired change; and whether the dissident represents the
        best option for enhancing long -term shareholder value.</div>
<div>Cumulative voting</div>
<div>We believe that a majority vote
        standard is in the best long -term interest of shareholders. It ensures director accountability via the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose proposals
        requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or director candidates.</div>
<div>Director compensation and equity
        programs</div>
<div>We believe that compensation for
        directors should be structured to attract and retain the best possible directors, while also aligning their interests with those of shareholders. We believe director compensation packages that are based on the
        company’s long-term value creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal. In addition, we expect directors to build meaningful share ownership over time.</div>
<div>Majority vote requirements</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors
        should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted and will normally support proposals seeking to introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority voting standards assist
        in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. Some companies with a plurality voting standard have adopted a resignation policy for
        directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where we believe that the company already has a sufficiently robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder
        proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</div>

<div>Risk oversight</div>
<div>Companies should have an
        established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing key risks. Independent directors should have ready access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure they can
        properly oversee risk management. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk measurement, mitigation, and reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight
        processes evolve in response to changes in corporate strategy and / or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long -term
        operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>Separation of chairman and CEO</div>
<div>We believe that independent
        leadership is important in the boardroom. In the U.S. there are two commonly accepted structures for independent board leadership: 1) an independent chairman; or 2) a lead independent director when the roles of
        chairman and CEO are combined.</div>
<div>In the absence of a significant
        governance concern, we defer to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</div>
<div>In the event that the board chooses
        a combined chair / CEO model, we generally support the designation of a lead independent director if they have the power to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of the independent
        directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent directors. Furthermore, while we anticipate that most directors will be elected annually, we believe an element of continuity is important for this role for an
        extended period of time to provide appropriate leadership balance to the chair / CEO.</div>
<div>The following table illustrates
        examples of responsibilities under each board leadership model:</div>

<div>AUDITORS AND AUDIT-RELATED
        ISSUES</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical
        importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on boards of directors, we seek to hold the audit
        committee of the board responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function at a company, and may withhold votes from the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality,
        independent auditing. We look to</div>

<div>the audit committee report for insight into the
        scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take particular note of cases
        involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we expect timely disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial
        statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that
        eventually lead to a significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice that protect the interests of shareholders, we may also vote against ratification.</div>
<div>From time to time, shareholder
        proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</div>
<div>CAPITAL STRUCTURE PROPOSALS</div>
<div>Equal voting rights</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that
        shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. We believe that companies that look to add or already have dual or multiple class share structures should review these
        structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Companies should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy.
        The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to
        shareholders. Equal voting rights</div>

<div>Blank check preferred stock</div>
<div>We frequently oppose proposals
        requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other rights (“blank check” preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of
        authority from shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as
        it affords the board the ability to place a block of stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</div>
<div>Nonetheless, we may support the
        proposal where the company:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>

                    </td>
<td>Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-takeover protection but may provide greater

</div>
<div>Increase in authorized common
        shares</div>
<div>BlackRock considers
        industry-specific norms in our analysis of these proposals, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares. Generally, we are predisposed to support a company if the board believes
        additional common shares are necessary to carry out the firm’s business. The most substantial concern we might have with an increase is the possibility of use of common shares to fund a poison pill plan that is
        not in the economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Increase or issuance of preferred
        stock</div>
<div>We generally support proposals to
        increase or issue preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</div>

<div>Stock splits</div>
<div>We generally support stock splits
        that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the
        stock, where the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g<font>.</font> one class is reduced while others remain at pre- split levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not also proportionately reduce the company’s
        authorized stock, we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</div>
<div>MERGERS, ASSET SALES, AND OTHER
        SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS</div>
<div>BlackRock’s primary concern
        is the best long-term economic interests of shareholders. While merger, asset sales, and other special transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our
        analyses, such as:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the
                    merger announcement. In most cases, business combinations should provide a premium. We may consider comparable transaction analyses provided by the parties’ financial advisors and our own valuation assessments.
                    For companies facing insolvency or bankruptcy, a premium may not apply
                    </td>

                    </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Unanimous board approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider whether the transaction involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of
                    an arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider whether executive and / or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders’
                    interests before their own
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>We prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial advisor assessing the value of the transaction to shareholders in
                    comparison to recent similar transactions
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>Poison pill plans</div>
<div>Where a poison pill is put to a
        shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although we oppose most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable “qualifying offer clause.” Such clauses
        typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is renewed.</div>
<div>These clauses also tend to specify
        that an all cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote, or the
        board to seek the written consent of shareholders where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic
        benefits that may be associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders.</div>
<div>We generally vote in favor of
        shareholder proposals to rescind poison pills.</div>
<div>Reimbursement of expenses for
        successful shareholder campaigns</div>
<div>We generally do not support
        shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations where we support the shareholder campaign. We believe that introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may
        incentivize disruptive and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</div>
<div>EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</div>
<div>We note that there are both
        management and shareholder proposals related to executive compensation. We generally vote on these proposals as described below, except that we typically oppose shareholder proposals on issues where the company
        already has a reasonable policy in place that we believe is sufficient to address the issue. We may also oppose a shareholder proposal regarding executive compensation if the company’s history suggests that the
        issue raised is not likely to present a problem for that company.</div>

<div>Advisory resolutions on executive
        compensation (“Say on Pay”)</div>
<div>In cases where there is a Say on
        Pay vote, BlackRock will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to
        shareholders. In a commentary on our website, entitled “<font>BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to executive compensation</font>,” we explain our beliefs and expectations related to executive compensation practices, our
        Say on Pay analysis framework, and our typical approach to engagement and voting on Say on Pay.</div>
<div>Advisory votes on the frequency of
        Say on Pay resolutions</div>
<div>BlackRock will generally support
        triennial pay frequency votes, but we defer to the board to determine the appropriate timeframe upon which pay should be reviewed. In evaluating pay, we believe that the compensation committee is responsible for
        constructing a plan that appropriately incentivizes executives for long-term value creation, utilizing relevant metrics and structure to ensure overall pay and performance alignment. In a similar vein, we defer to the
        board to establish the most appropriate timeframe for review of pay structure, absent a change in strategy that would suggest otherwise.</div>
<div>However, we may support an annual
        pay frequency vote in some situations, for example, where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance. In these circumstances, we will also consider voting against the compensation committee
        members.</div>
<div>Claw back proposals</div>
<div>We generally favor recoupment from
        any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial reporting or deceptive business practices. In addition to fraudulent acts, we also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior caused
        direct financial harm to shareholders, reputational risk to the company , or resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This
        includes, but is not limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically support shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a
        robust claw back policy that sufficiently addresses our concerns.</div>
<div>Employee stock purchase plans</div>
<div>We believe these plans can provide
        performance incentives and help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common form of employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) qualifies for favorable tax treatment under
        Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically support qualified ESPP proposals.</div>
<div>Equity compensation plans</div>
<div>BlackRock supports equity plans
        that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of shareholders. We believe that boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could
        disrupt the intended alignment with shareholder interests (e.g. the use of stock as collateral for a loan; the use of stock in a margin account; the use of stock or an unvested award in hedging or derivative
        transactions). We may support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</div>
<div>Our evaluation of equity
        compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that
        contain “evergreen” provisions, which allow for the unlimited increase of shares reserved without requiring further shareholder approval after a reasonable time period. We also generally oppose plans that
        allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may also oppose plans that provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. We encourage
        companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee before acceleration or special payments are triggered.</div>
<div>Golden parachutes</div>
<div>We generally view golden parachutes
        as encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to shareholders. However, a large potential pay-out under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a

        normally support the plan unless it appears to result in payments that are excessive or detrimental to shareholders. In evaluating golden parachute plans, BlackRock may consider several factors, including:</div>
<div>

                    </td>
<td>Whether we believe that the triggering event is in the best interest of shareholders
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>

                    </td>

<td>The percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Whether excessively large excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out
                    </td>

                    </td>

<tr>

                    </td>

                    </td>

</table>
</div>
<div>It may be difficult to anticipate
        the results of a plan until after it has been triggered; as a result, BlackRock may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved by shareholders when it was
        implemented.</div>
<div>We may support shareholder
        proposals requesting that implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval. We generally support proposals requiring shareholder approval of plans that exceed 2.99 times an executive’s current
        salary and bonus, including equity compensation.</div>
<div>Option exchanges</div>
<div>We believe that there may be
        legitimate instances where underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case -by-case basis.
        BlackRock may support a request to reprice or exchange underwater options under the following circumstances:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual company performance
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Directors and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax, accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully
                    contemplated
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>There is clear evidence that absent repricing, the company will suffer serious employee incentive or retention and recruiting problems
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>BlackRock may also support a
        request to exchange underwater options in other circumstances, if we determine that the exchange is in the best interest of shareholders.</div>
<div>Pay-for-Performance plans</div>
<div>In order for executive compensation
        exceeding $1 million USD to qualify for federal tax deductions, related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) requires companies to link
        compensation for the company’s top five executives to disclosed performance goals and submit the plans for shareholder approval. The law further requires that a compensation committee comprised solely of outside
        directors administer these plans. Because the primary objective of these proposals is to preserve the deductibility of such compensation, we generally favor approval in order to preserve net income.</div>
<div>Supplemental executive retirement
        plans</div>
<div>BlackRock may support shareholder
        proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not
        contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employee-wide plans.</div>
<div>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES</div>

<div>companies will deal effectively with the material
        environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses. Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;
        S risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to
        issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB
        and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations
        provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality
        map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking
        undertaken, and verification process in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with
        companies for several years on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically
        ask companies to:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Publish disclosures in line with industry specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their
                    particular business; and
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>Disclose climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a
                    scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines.
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>See our <font>commentary</font> on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.
                    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and
        our engagements to ascertain whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including
        BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>We believe that when a company is
        not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the
        election of directors where we have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such
        concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S
        factors. In deciding our course of action, we will assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>The company is in the process of actively implementing a response
                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•
                    </td>
<td>There is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder
                    proposal
                    </td>

</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to
        make social, ethical, or political judgments on behalf of clients, but rather, to protect the ir long-term economic interests as shareholders. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and
        regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are contradictory or ambiguous.</div>
<div>Climate risk</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out
        above, as well as our guidance on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long-
        term financial sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate-related risks and
        opportunities.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>We expect companies to help their
        investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around
        this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how
        climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk.</div>
<div>Where a company receives a
        shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of
        its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree
        that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>Corporate political activities</div>
<div>Companies may engage in certain
        political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to influence public policy consistent with the companies’ values and strategies, and thus serve shareholders’ best long-term economic
        interests. These activities can create risks, including: the potential for allegations of corruption; the potential for reputational issues associated with a candidate, party, or issue; and risks that arise from the
        complex legal, regulatory , and compliance considerations associated with corporate political activity. We believe that companies which choose to engage in political activities should develop and maintain robust
        processes to guide these activities and to mitigate risks, including a level of board oversight.</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder
        proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view regarding the
        associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards and management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals
        that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may decide to support a shareholder proposal requesting additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat
        or actual harm to shareholders’ interests, and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk.</div>
<div>Finally, we believe that it is not
        the role of shareholders to suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div>
<div>GENERAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
        MATTERS</div>
<div>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional
        votes</div>
<div>We generally support such proposals
        unless the agenda contains items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best long-term economic interests.</div>
<div>Bundled proposals</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should
        have the opportunity to review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BlackRock may reject certain positive
        changes when linked with proposals that generally contradict or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Exclusive forum provisions</div>
<div>BlackRock generally supports
        proposals to seek exclusive forum for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board unilaterally adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote
        against the independent chair or lead independent director and members of the governance committee.</div>
<div>Multi-jurisdictional companies</div>
<div>Where a company is listed on
        multiple exchanges or incorporated in a country different from its primary listing, we will seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific
        proposals</div>

<div>on the shareholder meeting agenda. In doing so, we
        typically consider the governance standards of the company’s primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs itself, and the market context of each specific proposal on the agenda. If the
        relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. We expect that
        companies will disclose the rationale for their selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, in particular where there is conflict between relevant market governance
        practices.</div>
<div>Other business</div>
<div>We oppose giving companies our
        proxy to vote on matters where we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight.</div>
<div>Reincorporation</div>
<div>Proposals to reincorporate from one
        state or country to another are most frequently motivated by considerations of anti - takeover protections, legal advantages, and / or cost savings. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the economic and
        strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to reincorporate. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protection under the new charter / articles / bylaws to assess whether the move
        increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections are diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</div>
<div>IPO governance</div>
<div>We expect boards to consider and
        disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon initial public offering (“IPO”) are in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also expect boards to conduct a regular review of
        corporate governance and control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our
        <font>letter on unequal voting structures</font>, we articulate our view that “one vote for one share” is the preferred structure for publicly -traded companies. We also
        recognize the potential benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, we believe that these structures should have a specific and limited duration. We will generally
        engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we believe that such arrangements may not be in the best interest of shareholders in the long-term.</div>
<div>We will typically apply a one-year
        grace period for the application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, director independence and over-boarding considerations), during which we expect boards to take steps to bring
        corporate governance standards in line with our expectations.</div>
<div>Further, if a company qualifies as
        an emerging growth company (an “EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted
        under the JOBS Act for the duration such a company is categorized as an EGC. We expect an EGC to have a totally independent audit committee by the first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on
        auditors and audit -related issues applicable in full for an EGC on the first anniversary of its IPO.</div>
<div>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS</div>
<div>Amendment to charter / articles /
        bylaws</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should
        have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including on changes to governance mechanisms and amendments to the charter / articles / bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to
        governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a reasonable period of time, in particular if those changes have the potential to impact shareholder rights ( see “Director elections” herein).
        In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes to the charter / articles / bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we may support such action if it
        does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance structure.</div>
<div>When voting on a management or
        shareholder proposal to make changes to the charter / articles / bylaws, we will consider in part the company’s and / or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes, the company’s
        governance profile and history, relevant jurisdictional laws, and situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed</div>

<div>changes, among other factors. We will typically
        support changes to the charter / articles / bylaws where the benefits to shareholders, including the costs of failing to make those changes, demonstrably outweigh the costs or risks of making such changes.</div>
<div>Proxy access</div>
<div>We believe that long-term
        shareholders should have the opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</div>
<div>In our view, securing the right of
        shareholders to nominate directors without engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, stimulate board attention to shareholder
        interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of directing that attention where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right without
        stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that the mechanism will not be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the
        company, or investors seeking to take control of the board.</div>
<div>In general, we support
        market-standardized proxy access proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate
        the greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</div>
<div>Right to act by written consent</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and
        with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders
        should have the right to solicit votes by written consent provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in
        addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent. We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act
        by written consent in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the board from incorporating appropriate
        mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the company
        already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that we believe offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a
        meeting.</div>
<div>Right to call a special meeting</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and
        with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders
        should have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of 15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is
        called, in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests. However, we may oppose this right in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant
        shareholder to the exclusion of others. We generally believe that a right to act via written consent is not a sufficient alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</div>
<div>Simple majority voting</div>
<div>We generally favor a simple
        majority voting requirement to pass proposals. Therefore, we will support the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders’ ability to protect
        their economic interests is improved. Nonetheless, in situations where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder, supermajority voting may be protective of public shareholder interests and we may support
        supermajority requirements in those situations.</div>

<div>The securities delivery
        cycles currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming investors, coupled with non-U.S. market holiday schedules, will require a delivery process longer than seven calendar days, in
        certain circumstances. The holidays applicable to each Fund during such periods are listed below, as are instances where more than seven days will be needed to deliver redemption proceeds. Although certain holidays
        may occur on different dates in subsequent years, the number of days required to deliver redemption proceeds in any given year is not expected to exceed the maximum number of days listed below for each Fund. The
        proclamation of new holidays, the treatment by market participants of certain days as “informal holidays” (<font>e.g.</font>, days on which no or limited securities transactions occur, as a result of substantially shortened trading hours), the elimination of existing holidays, or changes in

<td>These worst-case redemption cycles are based on information regarding regular holidays available as of January 17, 2020, which may be out of date as of the date of this SAI. Based on changes in holidays, longer

                    result of substantially shortened trading hours), the elimination of existing holidays, or changes in local securities delivery practices, could affect the information set forth herein.
