<div>The iShares Yield Optimized Bond ETF (the “Fund”)
seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of underlying fixed income funds that collectively seek to deliver current income.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive its management fees through February 28, 2021. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to February 28, 2021 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Example. <font>This Example is
intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those
periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
underlying funds in which the Fund invests (each, an “Underlying Fund” and collectively, the “Underlying Funds”), may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over”
their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover rate for the Fund or Underlying Funds may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Funds to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual
Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example (except costs to Underlying Funds included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was
48% of the average value of its portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Funds incur costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund is a fund of funds and seeks to track the investment
results of the Morningstar<sup>®</sup> U.S. Bond Market Yield-Optimized Index<sup>SM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”). The Fund invests primarily in</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Funds that themselves seek investment results corresponding to
their own underlying indexes. The Fund also invests in a combination of other exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) (including other iShares ETFs), cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”).</div> <div>The
Underlying Index is a broadly diversified fixed-income index that seeks to deliver current income while maintaining long-term capital appreciation. The Underlying Index is comprised of Underlying Funds within fixed-income sectors that collectively
have demonstrated relatively high risk adjusted income on a consistent basis and meet liquidity characteristics as determined by Morningstar, Inc.’s (“Morningstar” or the “Index Provider”) proprietary index methodology.
The goal of the Underlying Index is to represent an allocation to five distinct fixed-income sectors, with the exposure to each sector capped at a specified percentage of the Underlying Index. The five sectors currently included in the Underlying
Index, and each sector’s respective current caps, are: between 10% to 50% U.S. government and government-related fixed-income securities, between 10% to 50% U.S. securitized fixed-income securities,</div> </div> </div>
<div>  </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>between 10% to 50% U.S. investment-grade (as determined by Morningstar) credit
securities, no more than 20% U.S. non-investment-grade credit securities and no more than 10% emerging market debt. These five sectors are represented by Underlying Funds that Morningstar, as the index provider, considers to deliver higher risk
adjusted yields. Each fixed-income sector has its own return and risk profile. The combined allocation percentages of the five represented sectors will equal 100%. The Underlying Index is rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly.</div>
<div>As of October 31, 2018, the Underlying Index included the
following Underlying Funds within (i) the government related sector: iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF; (ii) the securitized sector: iShares MBS ETF; (iii) the investment-grade credit sector: iShares Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF, iShares
Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF; and (iv) the non-investment-grade sector: iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF. The Underlying Index may add,
eliminate or replace Underlying Funds at any time. The Underlying Index may include securities issued by sovereign entities. As of October 31, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by corporate bonds and securities of
companies in the financials and industrials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar
to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund or each Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the applicable Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Funds) of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of
BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the</div> </div> <div>

<div>Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities
(including indirect investments through the Underlying Funds) of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well
as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Morningstar, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Funds), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Affiliated Fund Risk.<font> In managing the Fund, BFA will have the ability to select Underlying Funds and substitute other ETFs consistent with the sector allocations of the Underlying Index which it believes will achieve the
Fund’s objective. BFA may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in selecting Underlying Funds and substituting other ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs managed by BFA may be higher than the fees
paid by other Underlying Funds. This risk may be reduced to the extent BFA has agreed to waive Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses with respect to an Underlying Fund. If an Underlying Fund or other ETF holds interests in an affiliated fund in
excess of a certain amount, the Fund may be prohibited from purchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or other ETF.</font></div>
<div>Agency Debt Risk. <font>The Fund or an Underlying Fund invests in unsecured bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, including the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). Bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, government-sponsored entities, or government</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>corporations, including, among others, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are
generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the U.S. government agency, government-sponsored entity, or government corporation issuing the bond or debenture and are not guaranteed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury
(“U.S. Treasury”) or backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the current status of many obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other agencies that are under conservatorship
of the U.S. government. Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) securities are generally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</div>
<div>Allocation Risk.<font> The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective depends upon BFA's ability to accurately assess the Fund’s asset class allocation and select an appropriate mix of Underlying Funds
and other ETFs to track the Underlying Index. There is a risk that BFA's evaluations and assumptions regarding asset classes, Underlying Funds or other ETFs may be incorrect in view of actual market conditions. Further, the Fund’s Underlying
Index may overweight certain asset classes relative to market capitalization weighted U.S. fixed-income benchmarks. The Fund will underperform such benchmarks when asset classes overweighted in the Fund’s Underlying Index underperform other
asset classes.</font></div> <div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or an Underlying Funds' portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (“the Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem
its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the
Fund</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>or an Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with
lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or an Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Funds, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other
service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business
operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of
securities in which the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s or the Underlying Funds' income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in</font></div> </div>

<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual
financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies
in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific
geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>
<div>High Yield Securities Risk. <font>Securities that are rated below investment-grade (commonly referred to as “junk bonds,” which may include those bonds rated below “BBB-” by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch
Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) or “Baa3” by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”)), or are unrated, may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated securities of similar maturity and
may be more likely to default.</font></div> <div>Illiquid Investments
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund
reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid
investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>transact at advantageous times or prices.</div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline due to a decline in inflation, deflation or changes in inflation expectations.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect
the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising
interest rates.</div> <div>Investment in Underlying Funds Risk.<font> The Fund expects to invest substantially all of its assets in the Underlying Funds, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying
Funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Funds and other securities in which the Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct
investment in the Underlying Funds.</font></div> <div>As the
Underlying Funds, or the Fund’s allocations among the Underlying Funds, change from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of any Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or
decrease.</div> <div>Through its investment in Underlying Funds, the
Fund may be exposed to <font>Management Risk, Market Risk, Market Trading Risk, Passive Investment Risk, </font>and <font>Tracking Error Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund or an Underlying Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of
those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Model Risk<font>.</font><font> Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index's allocation model will achieve its intended results or maximize returns or minimize risk, or be appropriate for every investor
seeking a particular risk profile.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Issuers
Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards,
the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international
capital.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and
communication errors, errors of the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund’s or each Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or
other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Funds and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every
possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privately-Issued Securities Risk. <font>The Fund or Underlying Funds may invest in privately-issued securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “1933 Act”). Privately-issued securities are securities that have not been registered under the 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to legal restrictions on resale. Privately-issued securities are generally not traded on
established markets. As a result of the absence of a public trading market, privately issued securities may be deemed to be illiquid investments, may be more difficult to value than publicly traded securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations
in value. Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Reinvestment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund or an Underlying Fund may invest a portion of its assets in short-term fixed-income instruments and, as a result, may be adversely affected if interest rates fall because they may have to
invest in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>lower-yielding bonds as bonds in the Underlying Index are
substituted.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities
to which the Fund or the Underlying Funds have exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund or an Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Funds may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities

<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange.</font></div> <div>Tracking Error
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Funds may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's performance
from that of the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's portfolio and those included in the applicable underlying
index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The bar chart and table that follow show how the Fund has
performed on a calendar year basis and provide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Both assume that all dividends and distributions have been reinvested in the Fund. Past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Supplemental information about the Fund’s performance is shown under the heading <font>Total Return Information</font> in the
<font>Supplemental Information</font> section of the Prospectus. If BFA had not waived certain Fund fees during certain periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower.</div>

table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
