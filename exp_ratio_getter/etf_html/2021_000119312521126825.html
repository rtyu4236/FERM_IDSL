those companies that are engaged in the research and development of therapeutic treatments but that are not focused on the commercialization and mass production of pharmaceutical drugs. The Biotechnology

<p><font size="2"><b>Index Description.</b> The ICE Biotechnology Index is a rules-based, modified float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of
qualifying U.S.-listed biotechnology companies. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Eligibility.</b> Underlying Index eligibility includes common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs, and
shares of beneficial interest or limited partnership interests that are listed on one of the following U.S exchanges: New </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE American, Cboe BZX, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market. Companies must be classified within the Biotechnology
<font>Sub-Industry</font> Group of the ICE Uniform Sector Classification schema and meet certain minimum market capitalization, liquidity, and other criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index.
</font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Weighting.</b> The Underlying Index is float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted subject to certain exposure limits. First, all constituents are
capped at 8% with any excess weight redistributed on a <font>pro-rata</font> basis to constituents below that cap, provided none can be increased above 8%. Next, the weights of constituents outside the initial five largest
are capped at 4% with any excess weight redistributed on a <font>pro-rata</font> basis to (i) any of the five largest constituents that are below 8% (provided they cannot be increased above 8%), and (ii) any
other constituents that are below 4% (provided none are increased above 4%). Finally, the cumulative weight of all ADRs is capped at 10% with the reductions applied proportionately across that group. Excess weight is redistributed on a <font>pro-rata</font> basis to (i) any <font>non-ADR</font> constituents among the resulting five largest constituents that are below 8% (provided they cannot be increased above 8%) and
(ii) any other <font>non-ADR</font> constituents that are below 4% (provided they cannot be increased above 4%). </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Issue Changes.</b> The Underlying Index undergoes a full reconstitution of constituent holdings annually in December. At the annual reconstitution, qualifying
constituents are <font>re-selected</font> based on the eligibility criteria, and float-adjusted market capitalization weights are determined subject to the weighting exposure limits. The reference date for the input data
used to determine security qualification is the close of the last trading day of October, and reference data for the input data used to determine weights is the close of the last trading day of November. The announcement date is the close of the
first Friday of December. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Quarterly Index Rebalancing.</b> In addition to the annual reconstitution, the Index is rebalanced after the close of the
third Friday of March, June, and September. At the quarterly rebalances, no constituents are <b></b>added to or removed from the index; however, constituent weights are recalculated based on updated float-adjusted market capitalizations subject to
the weighting exposure limits. The reference date for all input data used in the quarterly rebalances is the close of the last trading day of the month preceding the month of effectiveness (February, May, August) and the announcement date is the
close of the first Friday of the rebalance month. </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2"><b>Index Maintenance.</b> The Underlying Index is adjusted for corporate actions that affect constituents and
implements any intra-quarter float-adjusted shares outstanding updates greater than 10% in scheduled monthly share updates that take effect after the close of the last trading day of each month. Securities are removed from the Underlying Index only
when both the transaction and delisting is either confirmed or deemed imminent. If a security is suspended prior to its removal from the Underlying Index, then the security is deleted at the close of the next trading day at either the last traded
price (cash only terms) or the value of the deal terms (share or cash/share terms), if available. There are no intra-quarter replacements of constituents in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index implements a
<font>zero-price</font> <font>spin-off</font> policy. A <font>spin-co</font> is added into the Underlying Index effective for the
<font>spin-off</font> <font>ex-date</font> with a $0 price and no price adjustment is made on the parent company. After the close of the first day of trading for the <font>spin-co,</font> it is deleted from the Underlying Index at its last traded price. </font></p> <p><font size="1"> </font></p>
