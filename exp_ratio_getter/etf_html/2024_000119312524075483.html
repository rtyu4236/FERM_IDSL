<div><font>On April 10, 2023, the name of the Fund changed from the iShares MSCI Peru ETF to the iShares
MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(</font><font>“</font><font>BFA</font><font>”</font><font>), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and </font><font>generally seeks to track the investment results of the
specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that </font><font>Fund (each, an </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying Index</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each Fund offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>) only in aggregations of a specified number of </font><font>shares (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Unit</font><font>”</font><font>), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions </font><font>(including any portion of such
securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the </font><font>“</font><font>Deposit </font><font>Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Component</font><font>”</font><font>). Shares of </font><font>the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>Cboe BZX</font><font>”</font><font>), NYSE Arca, </font><font>Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>NYSE Arca</font><font>”</font><font>) or The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>Nasdaq</font><font>”</font><font>) (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Listing Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>). Shares of each Fund are traded </font><font>in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the
Fund's NAV. Shares are </font><font>redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the </font><font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role</font><font> of the Authorized Participant</font><font> section of this SAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount </font><font>(as defined in the </font><font>Redemption of Creation Units</font><font> section of this SAI) (other than the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF,
</font><font>iShares MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Kuwait ETF and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF, </font><font>which currently redeem Creation Units of its shares solely for cash). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, </font><font>generally ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 shares or multiples thereof.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash </font><font>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in
</font><font>advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized </font><font>Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use
</font><font>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the </font><font>Creation and Redemption

with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher </font><font>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases,
conditions with </font><font>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and </font><font>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Exchange Listing and Trading</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in each
Fund is contained in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The
discussion below supplements, and should be read in </font><font>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable
Listing Exchange and in other </font><font>secondary markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that </font><font>the requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The
</font><font>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </font><font>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or
</font><font>beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </font><font>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall
</font><font>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </font><font>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </font><font>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for
</font><font>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </font><font>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Investment Strategies and Risks</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its relevant </font><font>Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a
security in a Fund’s portfolio </font><font>will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </font><font>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment
</font><font>characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </font><font>variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that </font><font>uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as </font><font>described below.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Borrowing. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </font><font>redemptions or to facilitate
the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF, </font><font>iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China
ETF, iShares MSCI China </font><font>Multisector Tech ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF, iShares </font><font>MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Kuwait ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF,
</font><font>iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF, iShares MSCI UAE ETF and iShares MSCI Water Management
</font><font>Multisector ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New </font><font>York Mellon (</font><font>“</font><font>BNY</font><font>”</font><font>), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be </font><font>used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of
credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>SOFR</font><font>”</font><font>) published </font><font>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New

benchmark selected by BNY.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The purchase of securities while borrowings are
outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </font><font>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that
will reduce net income. </font><font>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </font><font>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </font><font>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as
</font><font>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </font><font>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being
subject to covenants in </font><font>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </font><font>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s
</font><font>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </font><font>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it
</font><font>may be disadvantageous to do so.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Currency Transactions.</font><font>  </font><font>A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (</font><font>“</font><font>OTC</font><font>”</font><font>) obligation to purchase or sell a specific
</font><font>currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract </font><font>is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC
</font><font>currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon </font><font>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures
</font><font>exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a </font><font>specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and
</font><font>delivery of the underlying currency. The Funds do not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging </font><font>against declines in the value of each Fund's assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into
non-U.S.</font><font> currency forward and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect </font><font>against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for
</font><font>speculative purposes.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A forward currency contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a
future date, which may be any fixed </font><font>number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A currency </font><font>futures contract is a contract involving an obligation to deliver or acquire the specified amount of a specific currency, at a
</font><font>specified price and at a specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather </font><font>than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures
</font><font>contracts will be maintained.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are
</font><font>effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </font><font>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks
</font><font>include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference </font><font>by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in
non-U.S.</font><font> currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or </font><font>correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a
</font><font>Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. A Fund could experience losses </font><font>if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it
</font><font>could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, </font><font>including trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</font><font> </font></div>

<div><font>A fund classified as </font><font>“</font><font>diversified</font><font>”</font><font> under the 1940 Act may not purchase
securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations </font><font>issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment </font><font>companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in
</font><font>securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With </font><font>respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940
</font><font>Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</font></div> </div>
<div>
<div><font> </font><font>A </font><font>“</font><font>non-diversified</font><font>”</font><font> fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be </font><font>invested in the
securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) </font><font>may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying
index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment </font><font>portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater
price volatility than that </font><font>experienced by more diversified investment companies.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund (whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise </font><font>conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (</font><font>“</font><font>RIC</font><font>”</font><font>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
</font><font>Code of 1986, as amended (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Internal Revenue Code</font><font>”</font><font>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to </font><font>the extent that its earnings are distributed to
shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution </font><font>requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the
investment </font><font>flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</font><font>  </font><font>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </font><font>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund
</font><font>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </font><font>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
</font><font>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </font><font>“</font><font>CFTC</font><font>”</font><font>) promulgated </font><font>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</font><font>“</font><font>CEA</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </font><font>of the term </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </font><font>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding
Derivatives </font><font>section of </font><font>this SAI for more information.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a
specified amount of a specific </font><font>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </font><font>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures
</font><font>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </font><font>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the
</font><font>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </font><font>“</font><font>initial margin,</font><font>”</font><font> which is similar to a
performance bond or good faith </font><font>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </font><font>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as
</font><font>“</font><font>variation margin,</font><font>”</font><font> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </font><font>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract
fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </font><font>contract more or less valuable, a process known as
</font><font>“</font><font>marking-to-market.</font><font>”</font><font> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </font><font>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite
position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </font><font>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a
contract, </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>4</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation,
in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </font><font>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon
exercise of an option, </font><font>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </font><font>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </font><font>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </font><font>futures contract.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </font><font>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the
</font><font>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </font><font>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The
</font><font>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </font><font>“</font><font>strike price,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call
options on futures </font><font>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </font><font>the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing
</font><font>positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </font><font>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </font><font>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying
Index.</font><font> </font><font>A call option gives a holder the </font><font>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</font><font>“</font><font>exercise price</font><font>”</font><font>) within a specified period of
time. A put option gives </font><font>a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </font><font>option pays the </font><font>“</font><font>writer</font><font>”</font><font> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </font><font>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market
</font><font>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </font><font>to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge
</font><font>against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell </font><font>securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options
</font><font>on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the </font><font>strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they
</font><font>are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be </font><font>structured to have conditions to exercise (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>Knock-in Events</font><font>”</font><font>) or conditions that trigger termination (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>Knock-out </font><font>Events</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Lending Portfolio Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </font><font>creditworthy, including borrowers
affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </font><font>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall
be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </font><font>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total </font><font>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the
</font><font>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </font><font>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </font><font>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </font><font>cash
collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </font><font>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market
value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </font><font>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each </font><font>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </font><font>are subject to investment risk.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC
permitting it to lend portfolio </font><font>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </font><font>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>BTC</font><font>”</font><font>) acts as securities </font><font>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance
</font><font>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </font><font>“</font><font>Board,</font><font>”</font><font> the trustees of which are the </font><font>“</font><font>Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>). JPMorgan </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Chase Bank, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>JPMorgan</font><font>”</font><font>) serves as custodian for the Funds (except the iShares MSCI Kuwait ETF, iShares MSCI Peru </font><font>and Global Exposure ETF, iShares
MSCI Qatar ETF and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF) in connection with certain securities </font><font>lending activities.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the
risk of losses resulting from problems </font><font>in the settlement and accounting process), </font><font>“</font><font>gap</font><font>”</font><font> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between
the return on cash collateral </font><font>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </font><font>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to
</font><font>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </font><font>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending
</font><font>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </font><font>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a
</font><font>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </font><font>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the
</font><font>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </font><font>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its
</font><font>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </font><font>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will
</font><font>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </font><font>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </font><font>be
changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </font><font>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could,
for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </font><font>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated
counterparties and certain of their </font><font>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </font><font>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </font><font>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </font><font>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government
</font><font>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </font><font>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Liquidity Risk Management.</font><font>  </font><font>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Rule</font><font>”</font><font>) requires open-end funds, </font><font>including ETFs such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Program</font><font>”</font><font>) and enhance </font><font>disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a
Liquidity Program, and </font><font>the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as the administrator of the </font><font>Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk </font><font>and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a
</font><font>“</font><font>highly liquid
investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>moderately liquid
investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>less liquid </font><font>investment</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>illiquid investment.</font><font>”</font><font> The Liquidity Rule defines
</font><font>“</font><font>liquidity risk</font><font>”</font><font> as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests </font><font>to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the
remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a </font><font>Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific
considerations under </font><font>the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for </font><font>“</font><font>in-kind</font><font>”</font><font> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a </font><font>less
liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-U.S. Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund intends to purchase publicly traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a </font><font>Fund invests in stocks of
non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American </font><font>Depositary Receipts (</font><font>“</font><font>ADRs</font><font>”</font><font>), Global Depositary Receipts (</font><font>“</font><font>GDRs</font><font>”</font><font>) and European Depositary Receipts
(</font><font>“</font><font>EDRs</font><font>”</font><font>) (collectively, </font><font>“</font><font>depositary receipts</font><font>”</font><font>). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of </font><font>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same
</font><font>currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust company and evidence ownership of </font><font>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts,
</font><font>are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or </font><font>domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in
registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, </font><font>issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both
in the U.S. and in Europe </font><font>and are designed for use throughout the world.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that
they evidence or into which they may </font><font>be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to </font><font>additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the
</font><font>depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency </font><font>risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock,
</font><font>generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the
</font><font>shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing </font><font>in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of
</font><font>expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, </font><font>which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.</font><font> issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may

<div> <div><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </font><font>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
</font><font>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>CFTC Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </font><font>investment
exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </font><font>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or
more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC </font><font>Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool</font><font>”</font><font> or a </font><font>vehicle for trading such instruments.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA pursuant
to Rule 4.5 </font><font>under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity </font><font>pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF, iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI China
Small-Cap ETF, iShares </font><font>MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure </font><font>ETF and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (the
</font><font>“</font><font>No-Action Letter
Funds</font><font>”</font><font>) may also have investments in
</font><font>“</font><font>underlying funds</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term </font><font>“</font><font>underlying fund</font><font>”</font><font> for </font><font>purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles,
mortgage or </font><font>international real estate investment trusts (</font><font>“</font><font>REITs</font><font>”</font><font>), business development companies and
investment companies that may </font><font>invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA </font><font>may not have transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this
</font><font>issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund </font><font>that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to
</font><font>delay registration as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity
pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional </font><font>guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has
</font><font>filed a claim with the CFTC for such funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to </font><font>registration or regulation as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool
operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA in respect of such funds.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and
non-deliverable forwards, are subject to </font><font>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Dodd-Frank Act</font><font>”</font><font>) in the U.S. and under </font><font>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards
and certain other </font><font>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </font><font>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </font><font>of
swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </font><font>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in such
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter
into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </font><font>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of </font><font>“</font><font>senior securities</font><font>”</font><font> under Section 18 of the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the
Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits open-end funds, </font><font>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </font><font>“</font><font>senior security,</font><font>”</font><font> other than borrowing from a bank (subject to a requirement </font><font>to maintain 300% </font><font>“</font><font>asset coverage</font><font>”</font><font>). </font></div> <div> <div><font>Under Rule 18f-4,
</font><font>“</font><font>Derivatives
Transactions</font><font>”</font><font> include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </font><font>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing,
</font><font>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </font><font>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise;
</font><font>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse</font><font> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </font><font>under
Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</font><font> (</font><font>“</font><font>TBA</font><font>”</font><font>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </font><font>physically settle
the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the </font><font>“</font><font>Delayed-Settlement
</font><font>Securities Provision</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below),
the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 </font><font>with respect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </font><font>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</font><font>“</font><font>DRMP</font><font>”</font><font>) and comply with a relative or absolute
limit on Fund </font><font>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</font><font>“</font><font>VaR</font><font>”</font><font>). The DRMP is administered by a </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives risk manager,</font><font>”</font><font> who is </font><font>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP
and </font><font>reports to the Board.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives exposure</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund
</font><font>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Limited </font><font>Derivatives User
Exception</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a </font><font>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually
agreed-upon time and price, </font><font>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </font><font>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase
</font><font>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </font><font>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </font><font>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i)
cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </font><font>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </font><font>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are
</font><font>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </font><font>seven days.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are </font><font>inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties
</font><font>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer </font><font>maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If </font><font>the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher
</font><font>quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s </font><font>repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the position a
</font><font>Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the </font><font>defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of
</font><font>losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </font><font>repurchase the securities at an
agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </font><font>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the
cash invested in the portfolio securities </font><font>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </font><font>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_2ea24903-f2a8-4735-958e-ae1a47775d68_9"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from
these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </font><font>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater
than the interest required </font><font>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </font><font>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the
</font><font>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </font><font>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </font><font>financing
transactions (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds)
notwithstanding the </font><font>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </font><font>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or
</font><font>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </font><font>“</font><font>Regulation Regarding
Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font> above.)</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities of Investment Companies.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </font><font>money market funds) to the extent permitted
by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered investment </font><font>companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total
outstanding voting stock of any one </font><font>investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s </font><font>total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest
</font><font>can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which </font><font>would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of </font><font>money
market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund </font><font>Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment </font><font>companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money </font><font>market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally
</font><font>short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised </font><font>by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, </font><font>fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions;
</font><font>(iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </font><font>“</font><font>Prime-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Moody's</font><font>®</font><font> Investors Service, Inc., </font><font>“</font><font>F-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Fitch Ratings, </font><font>Inc., or </font><font>“</font><font>A-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Standard &amp; Poor's</font><font>®</font><font> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., or if unrated, of
comparable </font><font>quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining </font><font>maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks,
</font><font>in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term</font><font> U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of
</font><font>comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be
</font><font>purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking
</font><font>institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial </font><font>banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Swap Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments
to </font><font>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </font><font>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the
</font><font>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </font><font>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </font><font>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The use of </font><font>swaps is
a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with </font><font>ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions
generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other </font><font>underlying assets.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Tracking Stocks.</font><font>  </font><font>A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business
unit or </font><font>operating division within a larger company and is designed to </font><font>“</font><font>track</font><font>”</font><font> the performance of such business unit or
division. The </font><font>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </font><font>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the
</font><font>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Future Developments.</font><font>  </font><font>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, </font><font>other than those listed
in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectuses, provided they are consistent with each Fund's </font><font>investment objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or
policies.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General Considerations and Risks</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is
contained in the applicable Prospectus.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s
portfolio</font><font> </font><font>securities may </font><font>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of stocks in </font><font>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any </font><font>particular risk factor.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Borrowing Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a
Fund’s portfolio. </font><font>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </font><font>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Cash Transactions Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Unlike most other exchange-traded funds (</font><font>“</font><font>ETFs</font><font>”</font><font>), each of the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, </font><font>iShares MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI
Kuwait ETF and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF </font><font>expects to effect all of its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. Paying redemption proceeds in </font><font>cash rather than through in-kind delivery of portfolio securities may require the Fund to dispose of or sell portfolio securities </font><font>or other assets at an inopportune time to obtain the cash needed to meet redemption orders. This may cause the Fund to sell
</font><font>a security and recognize a capital gain or loss that might not have been incurred if it had made a redemption in-kind. As a </font><font>result, the Fund may pay out higher or lower annual capital gains distributions than ETFs that redeem in-kind. The use of
</font><font>cash creations and redemptions may also cause the Fund’s shares to trade in the market at greater bid-ask spreads or greater </font><font>premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. As a practical matter, only institutions and large investors, such as market makers </font><font>or other large broker dealers, create or redeem shares directly through the Fund. Most investors will buy and sell shares of
</font><font>the Fund on an exchange through a broker-dealer. Furthermore, the Fund may not be able to execute cash transactions for </font><font>creation and redemption purposes at the same price used to determine the Fund’s NAV. To the extent that the maximum
</font><font>additional charge for creation or redemption transactions is insufficient to cover the execution shortfall, the Fund’s </font><font>performance could be negatively impacted.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Commodities Investment Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Exposure to commodities markets may subject a Fund to greater volatility than investments </font><font>in traditional securities. The
commodities markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility. Similar future market </font><font>conditions may result in rapid and substantial valuation increases or decreases in a
Fund’s holdings.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The commodities markets may fluctuate widely based
on a variety of factors. Movements in commodity investment prices </font><font>are outside of a Fund's control and may not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements may be influenced by, among
other </font><font>things: governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies; changing market and </font><font>economic conditions; market liquidity; weather and climate conditions, including droughts and floods; livestock disease;
</font><font>changing supply and demand relationships and levels of domestic production and imported commodities; changes in
</font><font>storage costs; the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems; energy conservation; the success of </font><font>exploration projects; changes in international balances of payments and trade; domestic and foreign rates of inflation;
</font><font>currency devaluations and revaluations; domestic and foreign political and economic events; domestic and foreign interest </font><font>rates and/or investor expectations concerning interest rates; foreign currency/exchange rates; domestic and foreign
</font><font>governmental regulation and taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other political upheaval and conflicts; governmental </font><font>expropriation; investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and commodities funds; and changes in
</font><font>philosophies and emotions of market participants. The frequency and magnitude of such changes cannot be predicted.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>The prices of commodities can also fluctuate
widely due to supply and demand disruptions in major producing or </font><font>consuming regions. Certain commodities or natural resources may be produced in a limited number of countries and
may be </font><font>controlled by a small number of producers or groups of producers. As a result, political, economic, regulatory and supply-related</font><font> events in such countries could have a disproportionate impact on the prices of such commodities.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>A decrease in the production of a physical commodity or a decrease in the volume of such commodity available for </font><font>transportation, mining, processing, storage or distribution may adversely impact the financial performance of a commodity </font><font>or
commodity-related company that devotes a portion of its business to that commodity. Production declines and volume </font><font>decreases could be caused by various factors, including
catastrophic events affecting production, depletion of resources, </font><font>labor difficulties, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment failures and unexpected
maintenance </font><font>problems, import supply disruption, governmental expropriation, political upheaval or conflicts or increased competition </font><font>from alternative energy sources or commodity prices. Agricultural commodities may be adversely affected by weather or </font><font>other
natural phenomena, such as drought, floods and pests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A sustained decline
in demand for such commodities could also adversely affect the financial performance of commodity-related</font><font> companies. Factors that could lead to a decline in demand include economic
recession or other adverse economic </font><font>conditions, higher taxes on commodities or increased governmental regulations, increases in fuel economy, consumer shifts </font><font>to the use of alternative commodities or fuel sources, changes in commodity prices, or weather.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The commodity markets are subject to temporary distortions and other disruptions due to, among other factors, lack of </font><font>liquidity, the participation of speculators, and government regulation and other actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some
</font><font>foreign exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices which may occur in a single business day </font><font>(generally referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>daily price
fluctuation limits</font><font>”</font><font>). The maximum or minimum price of a contract as a result of these </font><font>limits is referred to as a </font><font>“</font><font>limit price.</font><font>”</font><font> If the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made </font><font>beyond the limit price. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of </font><font>contracts at disadvantageous times or prices.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Currency Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>Because each Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may
lose money if the </font><font>currency of a non-U.S. market in which a Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of a </font><font>Fund’s holdings in that market increases. Generally, when the U.S. dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a security </font><font>denominated in that currency loses value because the currency is worth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar
</font><font>decreases in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that currency gains value because the currency is </font><font>worth more U.S. dollars. This risk, generally known as </font><font>“</font><font>currency risk,</font><font>”</font><font> means that a strong U.S. dollar
will reduce returns for </font><font>U.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar will increase those returns.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </font><font>effected are highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and
</font><font>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange </font><font>transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange
</font><font>transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the Fund’s performance and may lower a Fund’s return. A </font><font>Fund could experience losses if the value of its currency forward positions are poorly correlated with its other investments or </font><font>if it cannot close out its positions because of an illiquid market. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, including </font><font>trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Custody Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the
holding of </font><font>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </font><font>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </font><font>hold
securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </font><font>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be
subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </font><font>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses
of </font><font>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </font><font>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than
</font><font>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </font><font>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue
</font><font>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>other factors, could result in ownership
registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </font><font>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a
security or an agent of any of the foregoing </font><font>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for </font><font>compensation.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with </font><font>investors and underperform
the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </font><font>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held
by a Fund will not declare dividends in </font><font>the future or will reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </font><font>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Illiquid Investments Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </font><font>would have invested more
than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </font><font>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market
conditions in seven calendar days or less without </font><font>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </font><font>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the
</font><font>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </font><font>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </font><font>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Money Market Instruments Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </font><font>may be affected by changes in interest rates
or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </font><font>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for
the Fund to achieve its </font><font>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </font><font>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </font><font>market
funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </font><font>“</font><font>float</font><font>”</font><font> their NAV instead of </font><font>using a stable $1.00 per
share price.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Operational Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as
</font><font>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </font><font>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management
</font><font>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </font><font>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of
</font><font>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </font><font>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </font><font>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
</font><font>occurrence or effects.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Reference Rate Replacement Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently transitioned from, or </font><font>continue to be tied to, the London
Interbank Offered Rate
(</font><font>“</font><font>LIBOR</font><font>”</font><font>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, </font><font>hedging strategies or investment value. The FCA, which regulates LIBOR,
has ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In April </font><font>2023, however, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings will continue to be published under a synthetic </font><font>methodology until September 30, 2024 for certain legacy contracts. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>SOFR</font><font>”</font><font>), which </font><font>is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase
</font><font>agreement market, has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S.
</font><font>regulations that implement a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced </font><font>LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing
LIBOR-based</font><font> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </font><font>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to
</font><font>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </font><font>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing
</font><font>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </font><font>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </font><font>may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value
of an </font><font>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </font><font>such as the S&amp;P 500</font><font>®</font><font> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options and other </font><font>derivatives. Compared to
securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in </font><font>market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in
derivatives than if it invests only in conventional </font><font>securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will
not </font><font>fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </font><font>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
</font><font>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains and, in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </font><font>offset by gains, and a Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to
</font><font>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging </font><font>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Equity Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an </font><font>investment in equity securities,
including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the </font><font>general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease
in the value of the portfolio </font><font>securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations </font><font>and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor
</font><font>perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, </font><font>monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, </font><font>economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular
</font><font>investors or groups of investors (for example, retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or </font><font>significant </font><font>“</font><font>short</font><font>”</font><font> positions taken by institutional investors).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt
obligations because common </font><font>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or </font><font>holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount </font><font>payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks,
</font><font>which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, </font><font>common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at
</font><font>their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange,
the principal trading market for </font><font>some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend </font><font>on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or </font><font>maintained
or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a </font><font>Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for
the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if </font><font>bid/ask spreads are wide.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</font><font>
 </font><font>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </font><font>contracts and options on futures
contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </font><font>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each
Fund plans to utilize futures </font><font>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </font><font>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of
</font><font>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </font><font>a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily </font><font>cash
payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio </font><font>securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time
when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be </font><font>required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, selling uncovered stock index </font><font>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </font><font>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a
</font><font>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </font></div> </div> </div> <div>
</div> <div>

<div> <div><font>relative to the size of a required margin deposit.
The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </font><font>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of
stocks in which they </font><font>invest.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its
</font><font>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </font><font>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or
</font><font>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </font><font>could prove to be incorrect.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </font><font>increased
amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </font><font>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in
futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </font><font>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the
</font><font>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </font><font>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could
</font><font>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </font><font>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would
</font><font>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. </font><font> </font><font>An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in </font><font>portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S.
exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors </font><font>as economic and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived
trends in stock </font><font>prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and </font><font>denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically
</font><font>encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations </font><font>include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the
</font><font>costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Investing in any of the Funds also </font><font>involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively </font><font>securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price </font><font>volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of
</font><font>restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks </font><font>attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller </font><font>market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more </font><font>substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic,
</font><font>and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Swap Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a
</font><font>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </font><font>its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
</font><font>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s </font><font>rights as a creditor (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund
may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </font><font>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities Lending Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose
</font><font>money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could </font><font>also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of </font><font>any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Tracking Error Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>A Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a Fund’s performance from that of </font><font>the applicable
underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </font><font>instruments held in a Fund’s portfolio and those included in its applicable
underlying index, pricing differences, transaction </font><font>costs incurred by a Fund, a Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of
</font><font>dividends or interest received by a Fund or distributions paid to a Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through</font><font> tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the
applicable underlying index or the costs to a Fund of complying with various </font><font>new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market
volatility or other </font><font>unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a Fund incurs fees and expenses, while its applicable </font><font>underlying index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the
</font><font>value of the applicable Underlying Index and determining a Fund’s NAV.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>When an issuer is introduced by an index provider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such </font><font>issuer’s securities to identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not </font><font>appear to be supported by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short </font><font>interest or lending activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be
</font><font>indicators of possible irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, </font><font>alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to </font><font>continue to include the issuer’s securities in the rebalancing of its index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, </font><font>BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from a Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to </font><font>increased tracking error due to the divergence in the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s </font><font>underweighting or excluding such securities may result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the
</font><font>abovementioned analysis and screening to a Fund and its Underlying Index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates </font><font>(without any guarantees). The analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from an Underlying
</font><font>Index or a Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion of such securities will result in an adverse impact to a Fund’s net asset value if </font><font>one or more such securities declines in value.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Volatility Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>The value of the securities in each Fund's portfolio may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly
and unpredictably.</font><font> </font><font>The </font><font>value of a security may fluctuate due to factors affecting markets generally or particular industries. This volatility may affect a </font><font>Fund's NAV. Although certain of the Underlying Indexes were created to seek lower absolute volatility, there is no guarantee
</font><font>that these strategies will be successful. The Index Provider may be unsuccessful in creating an index that minimizes volatility, </font><font>and there is a risk that each Fund may experience more than minimum volatility. Securities in the Funds' portfolios may be
</font><font>subject to price volatility and their prices may not be any less volatile than the market as a whole and could be more volatile. </font><font>Events or financial circumstances affecting individual securities or sectors may increase the volatility of the Funds.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Indian Economic Trading Partner Risk. </font><font> </font><font>The Indian economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and </font><font>social instability. Disparities of wealth, the pace of economic liberalization and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection may </font><font>lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest in India. In addition, India continues to experience religious and border
</font><font>disputes as well as separatist movements in certain Indian states. Unanticipated political or social developments may have an </font><font>adverse effect on India’s economy. The Indian government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to
</font><font>liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the Indian economy, control the rate of inflation, reduce government </font><font>control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. There can be no assurance these reforms will continue or that they
</font><font>will be effective. The Indian government has experienced chronic structural public sector deficits. High amounts of debt and </font><font>public spending may stifle Indian economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. The Indian economy has grown
</font><font>rapidly during the past several years and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. India may experience </font><font>substantial (and, in some cases, extremely high) rates of inflation or economic recessions causing a negative effect on the
</font><font>Indian economy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Africa.</font><font>  </font><font>Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks </font><font>including, among others,
expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including </font><font>authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,
armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as </font><font>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries,
</font><font>genocidal warfare.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional
emerging market countries, and, </font><font>consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of </font><font>countries in Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those
</font><font>markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated </font><font>with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and </font><font>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended
</font><font>altogether.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Market volatility may also be heightened by the
actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in </font><font>Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets.
Since a Fund may need </font><font>to effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will </font><font>not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (</font><font>i.e., </font><font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund </font><font>effects securities transactions through a single
brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Certain governments in
African countries restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in </font><font>securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover,
certain countries in Africa require governmental </font><font>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign </font><font>investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an
</font><font>issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries </font><font>and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay
</font><font>investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is </font><font>pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to
</font><font>invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier </font><font>than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a
</font><font>decline in the value of a Fund's investments. Issuers located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the </font><font>same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less
</font><font>financial and other information publicly available with regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such </font><font>issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers
</font><font>located or operating in more developed countries.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, governments of certain countries in Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on
</font><font>income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes </font><font>are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in
</font><font>such countries.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater degree of risk associated with governmental approval in
</font><font>connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In </font><font>addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s balance of payments declines, such African country may impose
</font><font>temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a </font><font>refusal to grant, required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Funds of any </font><font>restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures,
</font><font>seek local government approvals or take other actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new and unsettled and,
consequently, there is a risk of rapid and </font><font>unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. </font><font>Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be
</font><font>no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of </font><font>corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to
</font><font>which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such </font><font>countries may not receive many of the protections available to shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries.
</font><font>Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable </font><font>enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in </font><font>Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </font><font>continue
to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </font><font>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the
countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </font><font>and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain
countries </font><font>in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. </font><font>These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In
</font><font>addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </font><font>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </font><font>by
the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has
dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </font><font>indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise substantial influence over many
aspects of the private sector </font><font>and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic </font><font>conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of
</font><font>diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may </font><font>be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Political instability and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused and may in the future cause significant </font><font>disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries </font><font>in those countries and adversely impacted the region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has
</font><font>further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly </font><font>through the region, and that developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some
</font><font>protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a </font><font>risk to investments in the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and
</font><font>terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Asia.</font><font>  </font><font> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically
associated </font><font>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened
risks</font><font> </font><font>include, among others, expropriation and/or </font><font>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </font><font>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</font><font> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian
</font><font>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </font><font>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </font><font>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and
</font><font>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </font><font>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions
</font><font>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </font><font>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on
</font><font>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </font><font>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </font><font>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities
</font><font>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </font><font>the performance of investments in this region.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their
</font><font>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </font><font>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </font><font>the
economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </font><font>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely
affecting investments in the region.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Corruption and the perceived lack of
a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </font><font>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain
economies in this region. In </font><font>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </font><font>sectors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Some
economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </font><font>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and
particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </font><font>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international
capital, </font><font>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </font><font>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse
</font><font>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </font><font>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Australasia.
</font><font> </font><font>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on
</font><font>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </font><font>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service and tourism </font><font>industries.
Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, </font><font>such as drought and flooding. Any such event in the future could
have a significant adverse impact on the economies of </font><font>Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New
</font><font>Zealand are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., </font><font>Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies
</font><font>of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign </font><font>ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade </font><font>foreign
investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Brazil. </font><font> </font><font>Investment in securities of companies domiciled in Brazil involves a high degree of risk and special </font><font>considerations not
typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks include, among </font><font>others, a high level of price volatility in the Brazilian equity and
currency markets, political unrest, chronic structural public </font><font>sector deficits, a rising unemployment rate and disparities of wealth.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Brazil has historically experienced high rates of inflation and may continue to do so in the
future. An increase in prices for </font><font>commodities, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency (the real) and potential future governmental measures seeking to </font><font>maintain the value of the real in relation to the U.S. dollar, may trigger increases in inflation in Brazil and may slow the rate of </font><font>growth of the Brazilian economy. Inflationary pressures also may limit the ability of certain Brazilian issuers to access foreign </font><font>financial markets and may lead to further government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government
</font><font>policies that may adversely affect the overall performance of the Brazilian economy, which in turn could adversely affect a </font><font>Fund's investments.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Brazilian government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Brazilian economy, which </font><font>may have significant effects on Brazilian companies and on market conditions and prices of Brazilian securities. The Brazilian
</font><font>economy has been characterized by frequent, and occasionally drastic, intervention by the Brazilian government. The Brazilian </font><font>government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the core of Brazil’s economy. </font><font>The Brazilian government’s actions to control inflation and affect other economic policies have involved, among others, the </font><font>setting of wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, fluctuation of the base interest rates, imposing
</font><font>exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil. In the past, the Brazilian government has maintained domestic price </font><font>controls, and no assurances can be given that price controls will not be re-imposed in the future.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Investments in Brazilian securities may be subject to certain restrictions on foreign investment. Brazilian law provides that </font><font>whenever a serious imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments exists or is anticipated, the Brazilian government may impose </font><font>temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investment in Brazil and on the
</font><font>conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. The likelihood of such restrictions may be affected by the extent of </font><font>Brazil’s foreign currency reserves, the size of Brazil’s debt service burden relative to the economy as a whole, and political </font><font>constraints to which Brazil may be subject. There can be no assurance that the Brazilian government will not impose
</font><font>restrictions or restrictive exchange control policies in the future, which could have the effect of preventing or restricting </font><font>access to foreign currency.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The market for Brazilian securities is directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and economic and market
</font><font>conditions of certain countries, especially other emerging market countries in Central and South America. Adverse economic </font><font>conditions or developments in other emerging market countries have at times significantly affected the availability of credit in </font><font>the Brazilian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested
</font><font>in Brazil. Crises in neighboring emerging market countries also may increase investors’ risk aversion, which may adversely </font><font>impact the market value of the securities issued by Brazilian companies.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. </font><font> </font><font>The economies of certain countries in which the Funds invest are affected </font><font>by the economies of other Central and South
American countries, some of which have experienced high interest rates, </font><font>economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and
political instability </font><font>which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>significant percentage of exports for the regions
and many economies in these regions are particularly sensitive to </font><font>fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on
some or </font><font>all of the countries to which the Funds have exposure.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The governments of certain countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of
</font><font>the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the </font><font>economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on the securities in which a Fund invests.
</font><font>Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some </font><font>countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international
trade and, consequently, have </font><font>been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative </font><font>currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These
</font><font>countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they </font><font>trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which a Fund invests may be the
</font><font>subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and </font><font>the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.
</font><font>government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An </font><font>issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. A Fund may
</font><font>be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in China. </font><font> </font><font>Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and </font><font>special considerations not
typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks include, </font><font>among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands
for improved political, economic and </font><font>social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring countries.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Military conflicts, either in response to internal social unrest or conflicts with other
countries, could disrupt economic </font><font>development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes </font><font>with Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people </font><font>in
Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal, </font><font>and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have
increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of </font><font>the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and
Chinese </font><font>markets. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has made threats of invasion. </font><font>Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may
</font><font>adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia </font><font>and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is
</font><font>alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and </font><font>threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs </font><font>or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of
</font><font>securities in which a Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability </font><font>within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the performance </font><font>of
the Chinese economy.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign
</font><font>investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, the
</font><font>Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </font><font>many companies. Chinese companies, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other
</font><font>sectors in the future, are subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. The </font><font>Chinese government continues to maintain a major role in economic policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of </font><font>loss
due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign </font><font>investments</font><font> </font><font>and on repatriation of capital invested.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A Fund may invest in securities issued by variable interest entities (</font><font>“</font><font>VIEs</font><font>”</font><font>), which are subject to the investment risks
</font><font>associated with the underlying Chinese operating company. A VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the </font><font>Chinese operating company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE has no equity ownership </font><font>of
the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>company into its financial statements.
Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect </font><font>the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s
contractual arrangements with the Chinese </font><font>company.</font></div> <div> <div><font>In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and </font><font>other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China, including Chinese companies that are listed on </font><font>U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider
</font><font>trading rules, tender offer regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the </font><font>requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. Securities markets in China are in the process of
</font><font>change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions </font><font>and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into
or litigation against Chinese </font><font>companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Funds are not actively managed and do not select </font><font>investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will
</font><font>recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation, significant indebtedness or economic recessions, causing a </font><font>negative effect on the economy and securities market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in </font><font>spending on Chinese products and services, supply chain diversification, institution of additional tariffs, sanctions or other
</font><font>trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or </font><font>alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse </font><font>impact on the Chinese economy and the companies in which a Fund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which may change </font><font>from
time to time) are directly or indirectly subject to economic or trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other </font><font>governments due to national security, human rights or other concerns
of such government. For example, certain foreign </font><font>technology companies are subject to U.S. export controls as those companies are believed to pose a risk to U.S. interests. The
</font><font>U.S. also bans imports of goods produced in certain regions of China or by certain Chinese companies due to concerns about </font><font>forced labor. Such restrictions may have unanticipated and adverse effects on the Chinese economy and companies. Any </font><font>action
that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or </font><font>cause market disruptions. The Underlying Index of a Fund
may include companies that are subject to economic or trade </font><font>restrictions (but not investment restrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other governments. So long as these restrictions
do not </font><font>include restrictions on investments, the Fund is generally expected to invest in such companies, consistent with its objective </font><font>to track the performance of its Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of China (</font><font>“</font><font>PRC</font><font>”</font><font>) are subject to change, including the
issuance of </font><font>authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of </font><font>such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary </font><font>over
time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect </font><font>on a Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to
capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In addition, </font><font>the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese companies may
be less </font><font>rigorous, and may result in significant differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with the PRC </font><font>accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets.</font><font>
 </font><font>Certain Funds may invest in H-shares (securities of companies </font><font>incorporated in the PRC that are
denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>SEHK</font><font>”</font><font>)), A-shares (securities of companies

(</font><font>“</font><font>SSE</font><font>”</font><font>) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>SZSE</font><font>”</font><font>)) and/or B-shares (securities of companies
</font><font>incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the </font><font>SZSE) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). Certain Funds may also invest in certain Hong Kong-listed securities known as
</font><font>Red-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, </font><font>directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial
</font><font>revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in </font><font>certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial </font><font>revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC).</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are
divided into two classes: A-shares, which are mostly limited to domestic investors, </font><font>and B-shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A-shares
market is generally subject to </font><font>greater government restrictions, including trading suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B-shares </font><font>market is generally smaller and less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A-shares market, which may lead to
</font><font>significant price volatility. B-shares, H-shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that also issue A-shares may trade at </font><font>significant discounts to their A-shares counterparts. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the
</font><font>ability to obtain a </font><font>“</font><font>back-door
listing</font><font>”</font><font> through Red-Chips or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an </font><font>experiment in economic reform. </font><font>“</font><font>Back-door
listing</font><font>”</font><font> is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or </font><font>P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the
</font><font>political and economic policies in China. Market developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government </font><font>intervention (including the possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may
</font><font>make it difficult to acquire, dispose of or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to a Fund.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF, iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China </font><font>Multisector Tech ETF and iShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF may invest in A-shares through the
</font><font>Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program (</font><font>“</font><font>Shanghai Connect</font><font>”</font><font>) or the Shenzhen-Hong Kong
Stock Connect program </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>Shenzhen
Connect,</font><font>”</font><font> and together with Shanghai Connect, </font><font>“</font><font>Stock Connect</font><font>”</font><font>). Stock Connect is a securities trading and </font><font>clearing program with an aim to achieve mutual stock market access between the
PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was </font><font>developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the SSE (in the case of Shanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case </font><font>of Shenzhen Connect), and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (</font><font>“</font><font>CSDCC</font><font>”</font><font>). Under Stock Connect, </font><font>a Fund’s trading of eligible A-shares listed on the SSE or the SZSE, as applicable, would be effectuated through its Hong Kong </font><font>brokers. Investing in A-shares through Stock Connect is subject to trading, clearance, settlement and other procedures,
</font><font>which could pose risks to a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Although no individual investment quotas or licensing requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect, trading through
</font><font>Stock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the </font><font>“</font><font>Daily Quota</font><font>”</font><font>), which limits the maximum net
purchases under Stock Connect </font><font>each day. The Daily Quota does not belong to a Fund and is utilized on a first-come-first-serve basis. As such, buy orders for </font><font>A-shares would be rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded (although a Fund will be permitted to sell A-shares regardless
</font><font>of the Daily Quota balance). The Daily Quota may restrict a Fund’s ability to invest in A-shares through Stock Connect on a </font><font>timely basis, which could affect the Fund’s ability to effectively pursue its investment strategy. The Daily Quota is also subject </font><font>to change.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A-shares purchased through Stock Connect generally may only be sold or otherwise transferred through Stock Connect and </font><font>in accordance with applicable rules. In order to comply with applicable local market rules and to facilitate orderly operations </font><font>of a Fund, including the timely settlement of Stock Connect trades placed by or on behalf of the Fund, BFA utilizes an
</font><font>operating model that will only be used by iShares ETFs with investments in A-shares through Stock Connect. Such operating </font><font>model may reduce the risks of trade failures; however, it will also allow Stock Connect trades to be settled without the prior
</font><font>verification by a Fund. Accordingly, this operating model may subject a Fund to additional risks, including an increased risk of </font><font>inadvertently exceeding certain trade or other restrictions or limits placed on the Fund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened </font><font>risk of erroneous trades, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>While A-shares must be designated as eligible to be traded through Stock Connect (such eligible A-shares listed on the SSE,
</font><font>the </font><font>“</font><font>SSE Securities,</font><font>”</font><font> and such eligible A-shares listed on the SZSE, the </font><font>“</font><font>SZSE Securities</font><font>”</font><font>), those A-shares may also lose such </font><font>designation, and if this occurs, such A-shares may be sold but could no longer be
purchased through Stock Connect. With </font><font>respect to sell orders through Stock Connect, the SEHK carries out pre-trade checks to ensure an investor has sufficient A-shares</font><font> in its account before the market opens on the trading day. Accordingly, if there are insufficient A-shares in an
</font><font>investor’s account before the market opens on the trading day, the sell order will be rejected, which may adversely impact a </font><font>Fund’s performance.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, Stock Connect operates only on days when both the Chinese and the Hong Kong markets are open for trading </font><font>and
when banking services are available in both markets on the corresponding settlement days. Therefore, an investment in </font><font>A-shares through Stock Connect may subject a Fund to the risk
of price fluctuations on days when the Chinese markets are </font><font>open, but Stock Connect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading through
Stock </font><font>Connect under certain circumstances. Where such a suspension of trading is effected, a Fund’s ability to access A-shares </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>through Stock Connect will be adversely affected.
In addition, if one or both of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are </font><font>closed on a U.S. trading day, a Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of A-shares through Stock Connect in
a timely </font><font>manner, which could adversely affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>A Fund’s investments in A-shares through Stock Connect are held by its custodian in accounts in the Central Clearing and </font><font>Settlement System (</font><font>“</font><font>CCASS</font><font>”</font><font>) maintained by the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (</font><font>“</font><font>HKSCC</font><font>”</font><font>), which in turn </font><font>holds the A-shares, as the nominee holder, through an omnibus securities account in its name registered
with the CSDCC. </font><font>The precise nature and rights of a Fund as the beneficial owner of the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities through HKSCC as </font><font>nominee is not well defined under PRC law. There is a lack of a clear definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership
</font><font>and beneficial ownership under PRC law and there have been few cases involving a nominee account structure in the PRC </font><font>courts. The exact nature and methods of enforcement of the rights and interests of a Fund under PRC law is also uncertain.
</font><font>In the unlikely event that HKSCC becomes subject to winding up proceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that the SSE </font><font>Securities or SZSE Securities may not be regarded as held for the beneficial ownership of a Fund or as part of the general
</font><font>assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Notwithstanding the fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary interests in the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in its </font><font>omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar for SSE- or SZSE-listed companies will still treat
</font><font>HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions in respect of such SSE Securities or SZSE Securities. </font><font>HKSCC monitors the corporate actions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE Securities and keeps participants of CCASS </font><font>informed
of all such corporate actions that require CCASS participants to take steps in order to participate in them. A Fund </font><font>will therefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement and
notification and implementation of corporate actions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The HKSCC is
responsible for the clearing, settlement and provision of depositary, nominee and other related services of the </font><font>trades executed by Hong Kong market participants and investors.
Accordingly, investors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE </font><font>Securities directly; rather, they are held through their brokers’ or custodians’ accounts with CCASS. The
HKSCC and the </font><font>CSDCC establish clearing links and each has become a participant of the other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-border</font><font> trades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC be declared as a defaulter, HKSCC’s liabilities in Stock Connect under its
</font><font>market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against </font><font>the CSDCC. In that event, a Fund may suffer delays in the recovery process or may not be able to fully recover its losses from
</font><font>the CSDCC.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Market participants are able to participate in Stock Connect subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk </font><font>management and other requirements as may be specified by the relevant exchange and/or clearing house. Further, the
</font><font>“</font><font>connectivity</font><font>”</font><font> in Stock Connect requires the routing of orders across the borders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This requires </font><font>the development
of new information technology systems on the part of the SEHK and exchange participants. There is no </font><font>assurance that these systems will function properly or will continue to be
adapted to changes and developments in both </font><font>markets. In the event that the relevant systems fail to function properly, trading in A-shares through Stock Connect could be </font><font>disrupted, and a Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective may be adversely affected.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Shanghai Connect program, launched in November 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in December </font><font>2016, do not have an extensive operating history. Stock Connect is subject to regulations promulgated by regulatory
</font><font>authorities and implementation rules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC and Hong Kong. There is no certainty as to </font><font>how the current regulations will be applied or interpreted going forward, and new or revised regulations may be issued from
</font><font>time to time by the regulators and stock exchanges in China and Hong Kong in connection with operations, legal
</font><font>enforcement and cross-border trades under Stock Connect. In addition, there can be no assurance that Stock Connect will </font><font>not be discontinued. A Fund may be adversely affected as a result of such changes. Furthermore, the securities regimes and
</font><font>legal systems of China and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on these differences. Further, different </font><font>fees, costs and taxes are imposed on foreign investors acquiring A-shares through Stock Connect, and these fees, costs and
</font><font>taxes may be higher than comparable fees, costs and taxes imposed on owners of other Chinese securities providing similar </font><font>investment exposure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A-Share Market Suspension Risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A-shares may only be bought from, or sold to, a Fund at times when the relevant A-shares may be sold or purchased on the
</font><font>relevant Chinese stock exchange. The A-shares market can have a higher propensity for trading suspensions than many </font><font>other global equity markets. Trading suspensions in certain stocks could lead to greater market execution risk, valuation risks </font><font>and liquidity risks and costs for a Fund, as well as for Authorized Participants that create and redeem Creation Units of the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily
limit, set at 10%, of the amount of fluctuation permitted in the prices of A-shares</font><font> during a single trading day. The daily limit refers to price movements only and does not
restrict trading within the </font><font>relevant limit. There can be no assurance that a liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular A-share or for any </font><font>particular time. This could increase a Fund’s tracking error and/or cause a Fund to trade in the market at greater bid-ask </font><font>spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Given that the A-shares market is considered volatile and
</font><font>unstable (with the risk of widespread trading suspensions or government intervention), the creation and redemption of </font><font>Creation Units may also be disrupted.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </font><font> </font><font>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </font><font>economic pressures. These countries generally
tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the </font><font>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies
</font><font>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </font><font>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
</font><font>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </font><font>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial
</font><font>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </font><font>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </font><font>economic
health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </font><font>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high
debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </font><font>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a
</font><font>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </font><font>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen
</font><font>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </font><font>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the
</font><font>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </font><font>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain
</font><font>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </font><font>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </font><font>developed
countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </font><font>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic
growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </font><font>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Eastern Europe. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly </font><font>speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe.
</font><font>Certain Eastern European countries have high public debt levels, significant underground economies, high unemployment </font><font>and emigration of skilled workers. Such countries generally have a history of political instability, limited infrastructure and an </font><font>inefficient public sector prone to endemic corruption. Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite
</font><font>trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments </font><font>have expropriated substantial amounts of private property, and many claims of the property owners have never been fully
</font><font>settled.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market economies at different paces with different </font><font>characteristics. Many Eastern European securities markets are generally underdeveloped with low, irregular trading volumes,
</font><font>dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate information. Eastern European securities markets are </font><font>generally subject to less government supervision and regulation and may be less liquid and more volatile than securities
</font><font>markets in the U.S. or Western European countries. Legal institutions governing private and foreign investments and private </font><font>property may be relatively nascent, inefficient, and unevenly enforced or inequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European
</font><font>governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many </font><font>companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which
</font><font>could have a negative impact on a Fund’s investments. Information and transaction costs, differential taxes, and sometimes </font><font>political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Eastern European economies may also be particularly susceptible to changes in the
international credit markets due to their </font><font>reliance on bank related inflows of capital. Changes to the economies of countries with substantial foreign direct investment </font><font>in certain Eastern European countries may negatively affect the region’s economy. The economy of certain Eastern European </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>countries may be adversely affected by global
prices for manufactured goods or commodity price declines to the extent that </font><font>a country relies on the export of such products.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Geopolitical events, including war, and other instability in certain Eastern European
countries may cause uncertainty in the </font><font>region’s financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. These markets </font><font>may be particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a
</font><font>result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia has historically asserted its influence </font><font>in the region using diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power, as it did with Georgia in
</font><font>the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014, and most recently on February 24, 2022.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</font><font>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of
Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </font><font>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets
and </font><font>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </font><font>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such
</font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </font><font>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for
</font><font>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </font><font> </font><font>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </font><font>investments in developed countries. These
risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </font><font>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such
securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </font><font>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </font><font>regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors
</font><font>and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local </font><font>governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be
</font><font>subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by </font><font>local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there
</font><font>may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </font><font>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the
</font><font>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </font><font>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </font><font>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </font><font>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not
</font><font>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume
</font><font>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </font><font>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in
</font><font>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </font><font>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher
</font><font>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </font><font>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in
</font><font>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </font><font>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </font><font>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the
</font><font>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </font><font>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in
</font><font>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </font><font>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </font><font>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </font><font>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>private property may be weak or non-existent.
Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </font><font>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </font><font>“</font><font>sovereign</font><font>”</font><font> assets. Certain emerging market </font><font>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases
with little or no compensation, and </font><font>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or
controlled to varying degrees. </font><font>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the </font><font>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit
</font><font>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of </font><font>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </font><font>by
nationals.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </font><font>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social
unrest, </font><font>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </font><font>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or
</font><font>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v)
</font><font>imposition of trade barriers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of
</font><font>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </font><font>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there
</font><font>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </font><font>difficult to conduct such transactions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital
</font><font>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </font><font>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large
</font><font>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </font><font>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these
</font><font>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </font><font>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary
</font><font>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </font><font>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of
</font><font>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Europe. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </font><font>associated with Europe in general and
the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </font><font>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European
country can have an </font><font>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </font><font>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union
</font><font>(the </font><font>“</font><font>EU</font><font>”</font><font>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the </font><font>“</font><font>eurozone</font><font>”</font><font>) </font><font>and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on
</font><font>inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect </font><font>every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in
</font><font>the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or </font><font>threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may </font><font>have a
significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners, including some or </font><font>all of the MSCI ACWI Index countries. Although certain European
countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries </font><font>are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </font><font>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </font><font>possible
default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </font><font>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In
order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>countries, without prior warning, can institute
</font><font>“</font><font>capital controls.</font><font>”</font><font> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </font><font>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such
controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </font><font>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and
sellers of credit </font><font>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </font><font>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected
</font><font>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </font><font>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European
</font><font>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </font><font>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further
</font><font>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </font><font>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </font><font>euro
and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </font><font>but could be significant and far-reaching and could
adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The
United Kingdom (the
</font><font>“</font><font>U.K.</font><font>”</font><font>) left the EU (</font><font>“</font><font>Brexit</font><font>”</font><font>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or </font><font>worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political
</font><font>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were
</font><font>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </font><font>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example,
</font><font>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may
</font><font>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </font><font>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact
</font><font>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</font><font> </font><font>and could adversely affect </font><font>the
value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Russian

</font><font>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Frontier Markets. </font><font> </font><font>Investments in frontier market countries, such as Argentina, may be subject to greater </font><font>risks than investments in more
developed countries. Frontier market countries are subject to similar risks as those of </font><font>emerging market countries, but the risks are more pronounced in frontier market countries.
These risks include: (i) less </font><font>social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets </font><font>for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less

markets in </font><font>developed countries. The markets for securities in certain frontier countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </font><font>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in
</font><font>frontier countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a </font><font>size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of
</font><font>many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and </font><font>competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large
</font><font>positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, </font><font>which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of frontier country
</font><font>securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the </font><font>price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Many frontier market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult
</font><font>to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private </font><font>property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to
</font><font>investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </font><font>“</font><font>sovereign</font><font>”</font><font> assets. Certain frontier market
countries in the </font><font>past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no </font><font>assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Foreign investment in the securities markets of certain frontier countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These </font><font>restrictions may limit a Fund’s investment in certain frontier countries and may indirectly increase the expenses of the Fund. </font><font>Certain frontier countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by
</font><font>foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer’s outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may </font><font>have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Many frontier market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability
characteristic of the U.S. and other developed </font><font>countries. Political instability among frontier market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution </font><font>of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in frontier market countries </font><font>may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of
</font><font>unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; </font><font>and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Fund’s income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of </font><font>the frontier market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in
</font><font>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Frontier markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these frontier markets there have
</font><font>been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to </font><font>conduct such transactions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the past, governments within the frontier markets have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and
</font><font>other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. </font><font>Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total
</font><font>GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the </font><font>opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for,
</font><font>among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </font><font>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary
</font><font>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </font><font>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of
</font><font>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in India. </font><font> </font><font>India is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in </font><font>comparison to more
developed markets. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has recently </font><font>experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with
certain of its neighboring countries, including </font><font>Pakistan, and the Indian government has confronted separatist movements in several Indian states, including Kashmir and </font><font>Punjab. Government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>expropriation of assets offer higher potential for
losses. Governmental actions could have a negative effect on the economic </font><font>conditions in India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of investments made by a Fund.
The securities </font><font>markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped and with some exceptions, consist of a small number of listed companies </font><font>with small market capitalization, greater price volatility and substantially less liquidity than companies in more developed
</font><font>markets. Stockbrokers and other intermediaries in India may not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S. or other, </font><font>more developed countries. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may also affect a Fund’s ability to acquire or </font><font>dispose of securities at the price or time that it desires or the Fund’s ability to track its Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Global factors and foreign actions may inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is
dependent to sustain its growth. In </font><font>addition, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian companies, which may decrease the </font><font>liquidity of a Fund’s portfolio and result in extreme volatility in the prices of Indian securities. In November 2016, the Indian </font><font>government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial
</font><font>markets. These factors, coupled with the lack of extensive accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and </font><font>practices, as applicable in the U.S., may increase the risk of loss for a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities laws in India are relatively new and unsettled and, as a result, there is a risk of significant and unpredictable change </font><font>in laws governing foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Foreign investors in
</font><font>particular may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. Certain Indian regulatory approvals, including </font><font>approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the central government and the tax authorities (to the extent that
</font><font>tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before a Fund can make investments in Indian companies. Capital gains </font><font>from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Technology and software sectors represent a significant portion of the total capitalization of the Indian securities markets.
</font><font>The value of these companies will generally fluctuate in response to technological and regulatory developments, and, as a </font><font>result, a Fund’s holdings are expected to experience correlated fluctuations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Natural disasters, such as tsunamis, flooding or droughts, could occur in India or surrounding areas and could negatively </font><font>affect the Indian economy or operations of Indian companies, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Kuwait. </font><font> </font><font>Kuwait is highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and trade with other countries involved in </font><font>the sale of oil, and its
economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and foreign currency values. As global </font><font>demand for oil fluctuates, Kuwait may be significantly impacted.
Historically, tensions between Iraq and Kuwait have </font><font>sometimes resulted in conflict. Any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or other countries in the region, could
</font><font>have a severe adverse effect on the Kuwaiti economy and its securities markets. Recently, Kuwait has experienced anti-government</font><font> protests. If the current Kuwaiti government were to change or become unable to function normally, any resulting </font><font>instability
could adversely affect the Kuwaiti economy and could decrease the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. </font><font> </font><font>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political </font><font>and legal systems in such countries
may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly </font><font>reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the
sale of oil and natural gas, and </font><font>their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign currency values. As </font><font>global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise
substantial influence over many </font><font>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, </font><font>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a
</font><font>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, </font><font>as well as the value of securities in the Fund's portfolio.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there
may be a high concentration of </font><font>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </font><font>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in
</font><font>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential
</font><font>liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the </font><font>shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern
countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount </font><font>greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle
Eastern issuers may be more </font><font>limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal </font><font>judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on
</font><font>investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain </font><font>countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by
</font><font>foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a </font><font>specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer </font><font>available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on
</font><font>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a </font><font>Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased
</font><font>re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result </font><font>in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be
</font><font>made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is
</font><font>subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors </font><font>has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries
with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment </font><font>income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required
governmental </font><font>approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and,
consequently, have been and may </font><font>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </font><font>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been
</font><font>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </font><font>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries
</font><font>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </font><font>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is
</font><font>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </font><font>indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes,
</font><font>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies </font><font>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as
</font><font>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for </font><font>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </font><font>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may
</font><font>escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign </font><font>intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in North America. </font><font> </font><font>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </font><font>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </font><font>all
of the North American countries in which a Fund invests. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The U.S. is
Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </font><font>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the
implementation of the North American Free Trade </font><font>Agreement (</font><font>“</font><font>NAFTA</font><font>”</font><font>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has </font><font>increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation
of </font><font>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</font><font>“</font><font>USMCA</font><font>”</font><font>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020,
could </font><font>negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and </font><font>legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value
</font><font>of certain securities held by a Fund. </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Peru.</font><font>  </font><font>Investment in securities of Peruvian and Peru-related issuers involves risks not typically
associated </font><font>with investments in securities of issuers in developed countries. Such heightened risks include, among others, less publicly </font><font>available financial and other information, political instability and social unrest. In addition, Peru faces economic development </font><font>problems, including heavy regulation of labor which may stifle economic growth, significant unemployment in certain </font><font>regions
and widespread underemployment.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>The securities market of Peru is considered an emerging market characterized by a small number of listed companies and a
</font><font>secondary trading market with small trading volumes and limited participants. These factors and others limit the supply of </font><font>securities available for investment by a Fund. This may affect the rate at which a Fund is able to invest in Peru, the purchase </font><font>and sale prices for such securities and the timing of purchases and sales.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Peruvian economy is heavily dependent on commodities markets. Peru is a major world producer of silver, zinc, copper,
</font><font>tin, lead and gold. Mineral exports generally account for the most significant portion of Peru's export revenue, and any </font><font>changes in this sector could adversely impact the Peruvian economy. In addition, the agriculture and fisheries sectors
</font><font>account for a large portion of Peruvian exports, and any changes in these sectors or fluctuations in the commodities markets </font><font>could have an adverse impact on the Peruvian economy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Peruvian economy is dependent on the economies of other Central and South American countries, Europe, China, and </font><font>the
U.S. as key trading partners. A reduction in spending on Peruvian products and services by any of these trading partners </font><font>or a downturn in any of these economies could adversely
affect the Peruvian economy. Any change in the price or demand </font><font>for Peruvian exports could adversely impact Peru’s economy. Peru’s economy may also be negatively
affected if trade barriers, </font><font>exchange controls or other protectionist measures are imposed or negotiated by the countries with which it trades.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Qatar. </font><font> </font><font>Qatar is highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas and trade with other </font><font>countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency
</font><font>values and the market for oil and natural gas. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, Qatar may be significantly </font><font>impacted. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a trade embargo against Qatar amid claims that Qatar’s </font><font>policies fuel extremism and terrorism. In response to these trade restrictions, Qatar established new trade routes with other
</font><font>countries, but continued strained relations with other countries in the Middle East may adversely affect the Fund’s </font></div> </div>
<div><font>investments. </font><font> </font><font>As a host to U.S. regional military operations, Qatar is susceptible to potential terrorist attacks. Qatar has </font><font>periodically
deployed troops to other Gulf Cooperation Council Countries to support their forces, which could lead to </font><font>hostilities against Qatar. Political, economic and social unrest could
adversely affect the Qatari economy and could decrease </font><font>the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the federal government of Qatar exercises substantial influence over many aspects of </font><font>the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly:
</font><font>restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is </font><font>exacerbated by the fact that Qatar is governed by a monarchic, emirate-type government. Governmental actions in the future
</font><font>could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Qatar, which could affect private sector companies and the Fund, as </font><font>well as the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Qatar’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have an </font><font>adverse effect on the economy. Allegations of human rights abuses against foreign laborers continue to surface and could
</font><font>affect relationships with key trading partners.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Although the political situation in Qatar is largely stable, there remains the possibility
that instability in the larger Middle East </font><font>region could adversely impact the economy of Qatar and strained relations with other countries in the Middle East may </font><font>adversely affect the Fund’s investments. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has caused significant disruptions </font><font>to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in the
</font><font>Fund’s portfolio.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain issuers located in Qatar may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes
</font><font>imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state
</font><font>sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates </font><font>in, or has dealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an investor in such issuers will be indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Russia.
</font><font> </font><font>Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special
</font><font>considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly </font><font>speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private
</font><font>property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result of </font><font>expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, </font><font>restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and potentially greater price </font><font>volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no
</font><font>assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be expropriated, nationalized or otherwise </font><font>confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a
</font><font>Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the </font><font>Russian court system.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic, political and social instability than is the case in other developed </font><font>countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military
</font><font>involvement in political and economic decision-making, including changes in government through extra-constitutional </font><font>means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal
</font><font>insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations, including armed conflict, with neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic, religious and racial </font><font>disaffection.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, </font><font>forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly
affected by international commodity prices and is particularly </font><font>vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia
or </font><font>internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia </font><font>produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of
</font><font>Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, </font><font>results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the
</font><font>Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </font><font>many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which </font><font>could
have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could </font><font>adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the
Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its </font><font>regional geopolitical influence (including military steps) and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on
February 24, 2022. </font><font>Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign </font><font>governments. Such steps have increased tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may </font><font>negatively
affect economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity </font><font>may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the
Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For </font><font>example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of
Industry </font><font>and Security’s
</font><font>“</font><font>Entity List,</font><font>”</font><font> which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these </font><font>may have
unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Russian economy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Russian invasion of Ukraine</font><font>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The
extent and duration </font><font>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </font><font>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </font><font>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such
</font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </font><font>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for
</font><font>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Russia Sanctions</font><font>. Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>Sanctioning Bodies</font><font>”</font><font>) have imposed </font><font>economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking
entities, </font><font>including banning Russia from global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies, or </font><font>others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>in the decline of the value and liquidity of
Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the </font><font>Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities
and/or funds invested in </font><font>prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Recently, Russia </font><font>has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>dividends), and prohibits
Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly states</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>as well as the export of raw
materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The
sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity </font><font>of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions
has and may continue to impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, </font><font>hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable
or unlawful for a </font><font>Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively,
</font><font>“</font><font>affected securities</font><font>”</font><font>), or if deemed </font><font>appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with
creation transactions </font><font>and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund’s transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required </font><font>to freeze assets in a blocked account.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, which has impaired the value and liquidity
</font><font>of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. Due to such </font><font>a freeze of these assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy </font><font>any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially
</font><font>lower prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures, which may further impair the value and </font><font>liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of the Fund to receive dividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number
</font><font>of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, dividends), and </font><font>prohibits
Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly states</font><font>”</font><font> as well as the </font><font>export of raw materials or other
products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russian companies may be unable to </font><font>pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund may be unable to receive
them.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the
Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident </font><font>investors from executing security sales, and other events have led to changes in the Fund's Underlying Index. The Fund’s
</font><font>Index Provider has removed Russian securities from the Underlying Index. To the extent that the Fund rebalances its portfolio </font><font>and trades in non-Russian securities to seek to track the investment results of the Underlying Index, this may result in
</font><font>transaction costs and increased tracking error. The Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including </font><font>those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. This disparity will also lead to increased
</font><font>tracking error. The inability of the Fund to trade in Russian securities may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to meet its </font><font>investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will </font><font>resume.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Also, if
an affected security is included in a Fund’s Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its </font><font>holdings of the affected security by employing or
augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the </font><font>investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy
may increase a </font><font>Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may </font><font>not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error
</font><font>between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds' Underlying Indexes include Saudi Arabian equity securities. The </font><font>ability of foreign investors (such as
the Funds) to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability </font><font>could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen
risks could materialize with respect to </font><font>foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market Authority (</font><font>“</font><font>CMA</font><font>”</font><font>) places investment limitations on the </font><font>ownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors, including
a limitation on a Fund’s ownership of the </font><font>securities of any single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent a Fund from investing in </font><font>accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against the Underlying Index. These restrictions may be
</font><font>changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted </font><font>at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses or approvals and may not be able to buy and sell
</font><font>securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could </font><font>negatively impact a Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, compared to more developed markets, given the limited history of
</font><font>foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. Investments in Saudi Arabia may also be subject to loss due to expropriation </font><font>or nationalization of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on additional foreign investments and repatriation </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>of capital. Such heightened risks may include,
among others, restrictions on and government intervention in international </font><font>trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement
in governmental decision </font><font>making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has </font><font>privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face
</font><font>strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in </font><font>newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a
</font><font>competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization of such </font><font>privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur. Further, under income tax laws imposed by the
</font><font>General Authority of Zakat and Tax, dividends paid by a Saudi Arabian company to foreign stockholders are generally subject </font><font>to a 5% withholding tax (different tax rates may apply pursuant to an applicable treaty). Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on
</font><font>income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is </font><font>therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market for petroleum, as well as acts targeting petroleum
</font><font>production or processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be </font><font>significantly impacted. In the recent past, the Saudi Arabian government has explored privatization and diversification of the
</font><font>economy in the wake of a diminished petroleum market.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of
</font><font>the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: </font><font>restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is
</font><font>exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced </font><font>strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events.
</font><font>Incidents involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause uncertainty in their </font><font>markets and may adversely affect its economy and a Fund’s investments.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in
Saudi Arabia, which could affect </font><font>private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on </font><font>Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the </font><font>value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi
</font><font>Arabian economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or funds investing </font><font>in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition, </font><font>Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have </font><font>an adverse effect on the economy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in
</font><font>Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, </font><font>illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control </font><font>and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than
</font><font>those of companies on exchanges in more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of </font><font>these securities and a Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia has
historically experienced political instability, </font><font>and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East
region </font><font>could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government </font><font>interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or </font><font>other factors. Additionally, anti-Western views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies
</font><font>regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries </font><font>may affect these attitudes and policies. The U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a </font><font>result, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S.
</font><font>imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </font><font>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result,
</font><font>securities to which a Fund has exposure. Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused </font><font>significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value </font><font>of securities in a Fund’s portfolio.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or
</font><font>embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an
issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which </font><font>operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will
be indirectly subject to those </font><font>risks.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Settlement and Associated Risks.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Saudi Arabian equities can only be purchased on a pre-funded basis, whereby the iShares MSCI
Saudi Arabia ETF or its broker </font><font>(on behalf of the Fund), must deliver the applicable pre-funding amount to cover purchases before trade settlements may </font><font>take place. In the event that the pre-funding amount is not delivered by the deadline established with the Fund’s custodian, </font><font>or if the pre-funding amount is insufficient to purchase all the underlying securities in connection with the creation or
</font><font>portfolio rebalance, the Fund would not be able to acquire all the requisite underlying securities during such purchase. In this </font><font>situation, additional local currency would have to be delivered to the Fund’s onshore custody account to enable additional </font><font>purchases on subsequent days. This could result in higher brokerage costs for Authorized Participants in a creation and
</font><font>higher tracking error in the case of a portfolio rebalance.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Saudi Arabia Broker Risk.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in the Saudi Arabian market.
The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia </font><font>ETF generally expects to conduct its transactions in a manner in which the Fund would not be limited by Saudi Arabian </font><font>regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who can provide services to the Fund,
</font><font>which may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity and timing of Fund transactions. The limited number of brokers </font><font>may impact the Fund’s ability to achieve best execution on securities transactions. In addition, the limited number of brokers </font><font>available to the Fund may make the Fund more susceptible to credit loss or trading disruptions in the event of a default or
</font><font>business disruption by one or more of the available brokers. Should the Fund’s ability to use one or more brokers be affected </font><font>for any reason, this could disrupt the operations of the Fund and affect the ability of the Fund to track the Underlying Index
</font><font>and/or cause the Fund’s shares to trade at a premium or discount to NAV. The Fund may also incur losses due to the acts or </font><font>omissions of its brokers in the execution or settlement of any transaction or in the transfer of any funds or securities.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Special Risk Considerations Relating to the QFI Regime and Investments in
Saudi Arabian Equities.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF’s ability to achieve its investment objective depends on the ability of BFA as a foreign </font><font>investor registered with the CMA as a Qualified Foreign Investor (</font><font>“</font><font>QFI</font><font>”</font><font>), and the Fund as a client of a QFI who has
been </font><font>approved by the CMA (a </font><font>“</font><font>QFI
Client</font><font>”</font><font>), to maintain their respective authorizations from the CMA, and thereby allow the Fund </font><font>to invest in the constituent securities of the Underlying Index. A failure to maintain such authorization could limit the Fund’s </font><font>ability to gain exposure to the securities of the Underlying Index and could increase the cost to the Fund of gaining such
</font><font>exposure. Even with QFI Client status, the Fund will not have an exclusive investment quota and will be subject to foreign </font><font>investment limitations and other regulations imposed by the CMA on QFIs and QFI Clients (individually and in the aggregate),
</font><font>as well as local market participants. If such limitations are reached or other market factors impact the Fund’s ability to invest </font><font>in securities of the Underlying Index or otherwise meet investor demand for Fund shares, BFA may invest a portion of the
</font><font>Fund’s assets in securities not included in the Underlying Index or in derivatives, which may increase the Fund’s tracking </font><font>error. If the Fund is unable to invest in a manner consistent with its investment objective and tracking risk tolerance, BFA may </font><font>reject new creation orders for Fund shares. Rejection of new creation orders could cause the Fund’s shares to trade in the </font><font>secondary market at a higher than usual premium or discount to NAV. QFI regulations and local market infrastructure are
</font><font>relatively new and have not been tested through multiple business cycles or market events, and the CMA may discontinue </font><font>the QFI regime and other avenues for foreign investment in Saudi Arabian equities at any time, or impose additional barriers
</font><font>or restrictions on foreign investment. Any change in the QFI system generally, including the possibility of BFA or the Fund </font><font>losing their respective QFI and QFI Client status, may affect the Fund’s ability to invest in securities of the Underlying Index.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the United Arab Emirates (</font><font>“</font><font>UAE</font><font>”</font><font>). </font><font> </font><font>The UAE economy is dominated by petroleum export. The non-oil </font><font>economy, concentrated in Dubai’s service sector, notably in tourism, real estate, banking and re-export trade, has grown
</font><font>rapidly over the past several years. However, as the recent global credit crisis and the corresponding fallout in Dubai’s service </font><font>sector have shown, the UAE economy remains anchored by Abu Dhabi’s oil production. A sustained decrease in commodity
</font><font>prices could have a significant negative impact on all aspects of the UAE economy.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the federal government of the UAE and the governments of the individual emirates </font><font>exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Although free zones have played a crucial part in the
</font><font>growth of the UAE’s non-oil economy, liberalization in the wider economy has lagged: restrictions on foreign ownership </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>persist, and the government has an ownership stake
in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the </font><font>UAE is governed by an authoritarian government. Governmental actions in the future could have a
significant effect on </font><font>economic conditions in the UAE, which could affect private sector companies and the value of securities in the Fund’s </font><font>portfolio.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Although the
political situation in the UAE is largely stable, instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact </font><font>the economy of the UAE. Recent political instability and
protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant </font><font>disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the
value of the </font><font>Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain issuers located in the UAE may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes
</font><font>imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state
</font><font>sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates </font><font>in, or has dealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an investor in such issuers will be indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. </font><font> </font><font>The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or </font><font>foreign investor in, certain countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be
</font><font>particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial </font><font>regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material
</font><font>adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure. Circumstances </font><font>could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the
</font><font>legislative </font><font>“</font><font>debt ceiling.</font><font>”</font><font> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the </font><font>global financial system.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are strained relations between the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. If these relations were to worsen, it could
</font><font>adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased </font><font>internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and many of
</font><font>the issuers in which a Fund invests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </font><font>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in
the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in </font><font>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless
</font><font>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </font><font>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds,
</font><font>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </font><font>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </font><font>products
and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting </font><font>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can
drastically affect a communication services </font><font>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </font><font>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer
</font><font>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive
government regulation. The costs of </font><font>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </font><font>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </font><font>world,
specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </font><font>communications services industry can also be significantly
affected by intense competition for market share, including </font><font>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization,
</font><font>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </font><font>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the
</font><font>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </font><font>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </font><font>innovations
may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to
</font><font>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may </font><font>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>oversight, among other factors, have led to
consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </font><font>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S.
countries may be </font><font>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </font><font>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several
factors, including competition, </font><font>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </font><font>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential
</font><font>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. </font><font>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </font><font>downturns
advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </font><font>less revenue.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </font><font>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting,
</font><font>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </font><font>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel,
travel-related</font><font> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </font><font>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </font><font>household
income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </font><font>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when
economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </font><font>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </font><font>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </font><font>campaigns,
cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </font><font>import and export controls, intense competition, technological
developments and government regulation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of
Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the consumer staples sector may
be adversely affected by </font><font>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </font><font>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </font><font>and
political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </font><font>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various
food additives and production methods of companies that make </font><font>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by
the </font><font>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </font><font>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a
</font><font>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </font><font>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions.
</font><font>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </font><font>their profitability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the changes in and volatility </font><font>of global energy prices, energy supply
and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </font><font>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that
they cannot </font><font>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </font><font>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes
</font><font>distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical and is highly </font><font>dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of </font><font>time
due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>OPEC</font><font>”</font><font>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the </font><font>regulatory
environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, </font><font>and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies
in the energy sector may be adversely affected by </font><font>terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. While certain Funds seek to invest in companies with </font><font>positive or favorable environmental and social characteristics, companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability from
</font><font>accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and gas </font><font>deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to
</font><font>the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </font><font>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic
conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </font><font>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies
operate (</font><font>e.g</font><font>.,
</font><font>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </font><font>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </font><font>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental
</font><font>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </font><font>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </font><font>their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity.
</font><font>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance costs and may </font><font>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s
large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </font><font>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to </font><font>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S.
</font><font>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions </font><font>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </font><font>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to
</font><font>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </font><font>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </font><font>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset
management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </font><font>companies
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer
finance firms, </font><font>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental
regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </font><font>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have
significant </font><font>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </font><font>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect
</font><font>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </font><font>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual
</font><font>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </font><font>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest
</font><font>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </font><font>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general
</font><font>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </font><font>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and
</font><font>restrictions on currency transfers. Market conditions and regulation in China may be particularly subject to change based on </font><font>government policy. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of
</font><font>proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </font><font>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up,
</font><font>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </font><font>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </font><font>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic
</font><font>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </font><font>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are
</font><font>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </font><font>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the
</font><font>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </font><font>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </font><font>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</font><font>
risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as
adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </font><font>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to
such </font><font>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </font><font>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse
</font><font>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </font><font>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise
</font><font>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </font><font>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased
</font><font>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </font><font>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector.
</font><font> </font><font>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </font><font>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or
</font><font>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </font><font>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </font><font>companies
are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </font><font>“</font><font>generic</font><font>”</font><font> products </font><font>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to
</font><font>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </font><font>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare
sector affect the health and well-being </font><font>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </font><font>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may
</font><font>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </font><font>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery
</font><font>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </font><font>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </font><font>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </font><font>a
material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </font><font>biotechnology or technological developments, and their
products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </font><font>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by
changes </font><font>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </font><font>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and
</font><font>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </font><font>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what
</font><font>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to
</font><font>“</font><font>determinations of
need</font><font>”</font><font> by certain </font><font>government
authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </font><font>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and
profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </font><font>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and
national </font><font>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </font><font>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </font><font>adversely affected by supply of and demand for
both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </font><font>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological
developments and </font><font>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </font><font>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by
</font><font>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </font><font>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely
</font><font>affect the sector. Furthermore, while certain Funds seek to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and </font><font>social characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product
</font><font>liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the
Information Technology Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Information technology companies face intense
competition, both </font><font>domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, </font><font>information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products </font><font>of
information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent </font><font>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates
and competition for the services of qualified personnel. </font><font>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies,
</font><font>tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </font><font>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these </font><font>companies. Information technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject </font><font>to
adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, </font><font>certain companies in the information technology sector may be
particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </font><font>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.
</font><font>These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector.
</font><font> </font><font>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </font><font>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition,
</font><font>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </font><font>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. While
</font><font>certain Funds seek to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social characteristics, companies in </font><font>the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials </font><font>may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These </font><font>risks
are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </font><font>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and
operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </font><font>“</font><font>Real </font><font>Estate Companies</font><font>”</font><font>). Investing in Real Estate
Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </font><font>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and
operated. The real estate </font><font>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </font><font>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific
</font><font>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Concentration Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their
investments in a </font><font>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </font><font>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Distressed Investment Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank
loans. </font><font>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </font><font>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </font><font>bankruptcy.
Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </font><font>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to
financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </font><font>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Illiquidity Risk.</font><font> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</font><font>
companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </font><font>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of
large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </font><font>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on
share price, </font><font>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </font><font>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Indian Tax Risk</font><font>: The IT Act has been amended by the Finance Act, 2020 to tax the distributions made by REITS, out of the </font><font>dividends
received, in the hands of the unit holders. Earlier, a company distributing dividends to a REIT, was not liable to pay </font><font>dividend distribution tax on such dividends, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions. Such dividends were considered </font><font>a pass through income for the REIT and the distributions made by the REIT to the unit holders from such dividends
was also </font><font>exempt from tax in the hands of the non-resident unit holders.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Pursuant to the Finance Act, 2020, the dividend distribution tax has been abolished. Accordingly, under the amended IT Act, </font><font>a company distributing dividends to a REIT would not be liable to pay dividend distribution tax irrespective of the satisfaction </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>39</font></div>

<div> <div><font>of any condition. However, the amended IT Act
provides that though such dividend income would continue to be treated as </font><font>pass through income for the REIT, the distributions made from such dividends by the REITs may be taxed in
the hands of the </font><font>unit holders (</font><font>i.e.</font><font> investors) in the REIT depending on the taxation regime adopted by the investee company. This may have a </font><font>bearing on the
returns of the Fund from investments in Indian REITs.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Interest
Rate Risk.</font><font> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could
</font><font>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </font><font>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Leverage Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be
highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </font><font>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real
Estate </font><font>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </font><font>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </font><font>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient
</font><font>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </font><font>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make
</font><font>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans
that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </font><font>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to
</font><font>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </font><font>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of
</font><font>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </font><font>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Management Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </font><font>Real Estate Companies
are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </font><font>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate
Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </font><font>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have
</font><font>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </font><font>properties may be limited.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Property Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or
reduced desirability of </font><font>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </font><font>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be
</font><font>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </font><font>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Regulatory Risk.</font><font> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </font><font>laws (including
tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </font><font>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major
impact on real estate income and values. In </font><font>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </font><font>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs
</font><font>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Underlying Investment Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity
instruments with </font><font>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </font><font>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated
</font><font>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </font><font>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </font><font>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a
</font><font>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </font><font>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated
</font><font>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </font><font>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral.
</font><font>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </font><font>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>U.S. Tax Risk.</font><font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </font><font>comply with
such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </font><font>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S.
federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </font><font>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A
REIT that </font><font>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </font><font>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.
</font><font>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </font><font>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise
</font><font>provided to you.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </font><font>innovations and evolving industry standards,
and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </font><font>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often
smaller and less </font><font>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </font><font>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </font><font>resources
or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </font><font>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer
and business purchasing patterns, </font><font>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </font><font>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those
</font><font>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </font><font>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property
</font><font>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </font><font>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or
</font><font>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </font><font>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network
</font><font>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </font><font>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </font><font>government regulation stipulating rates charged
by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </font><font>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also
subject to potential terrorist attacks, </font><font>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </font><font>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore
</font><font>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </font><font>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory
</font><font>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </font><font>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for
</font><font>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </font><font>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional
</font><font>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </font><font>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a
</font><font>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and
</font><font>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </font><font>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt
</font><font>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </font><font>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </font><font>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to
</font><font>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </font><font>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand
</font><font>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</font><font> </font></div>

the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies and
procedures (collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies</font><font>”</font><font>) governing </font><font>proxy voting by accounts managed by
BFA, including the Funds.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund
</font><font>and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </font><font>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures
</font><font>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </font><font>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </font><font>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </font><font>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident
</font><font>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </font><font>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further

<div> <div><font>Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes are provided below.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>With respect to certain underlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have
held discussions with the applicable </font><font>index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed </font><font>investment concepts and strategies that could be considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted such
</font><font>indices using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole </font><font>user of the underlying index. In its sole discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other </font><font>instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and
</font><font>other instruments in the underlying index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may </font><font>also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s
</font><font>consultation process or pursuant to other communications with the index provider.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The MSCI Indexes</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The MSCI indexes were founded in 1969 by Capital International S.A. as international performance benchmarks constructed </font><font>to
facilitate comparison of world markets. The MSCI single country standard equity indexes have covered the world's </font><font>developed markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI commenced coverage of
emerging markets.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Local stock exchanges traditionally calculated their own indexes, which were generally not comparable with one another due
</font><font>to differences in the representation of the local market, mathematical formulas, base dates and methods of adjusting for </font><font>capital changes. MSCI, however, applies the same calculation methodology to all markets for all single country standard
</font><font>equity indexes, both developed and emerging.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MSCI's Global Investable Market Indexes (the
</font><font>“</font><font>MSCI GIMI</font><font>”</font><font>) provide coverage and non-overlapping market segmentation by </font><font>market capitalization size and by style. The MSCI GIMI intend
to target approximately 99% coverage of the free float-adjusted </font><font>market capitalization in each market of large-, mid- and small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI creates an
Investable </font><font>Market Index, Standard Index, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap Index, </font><font>Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are each subsets of the Investable Market Index for a market.

<div> <div><font>Index is the aggregation of the Large Cap Index
and Mid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the aggregation of the MSCI Global </font><font>Standard Index and MSCI Global Small Cap Index.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Selection Criteria.</font><font> MSCI's index construction process involves: (i) defining the equity universe; (ii) determining the market </font><font>investable equity
universe for each market; (iii) determining market capitalization size segments for each market; (iv) </font><font>applying final size segment investability requirements; and (v) applying index
continuity rules for the MSCI Global Standard </font><font>Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Defining the Equity Universe</font><font>. MSCI begins with securities listed in countries in the MSCI GIMI. As of June
8, 2023, 23 are </font><font>classified as developed markets, 24 as emerging markets, and 21 as frontier markets (frontier markets exclude the West </font><font>African Economic and Monetary Union, which consists of securities classified in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau,</font><font> Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo). All listed equity securities and listed securities that exhibit characteristics of equity
</font><font>securities, except mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited partnerships and most investment trusts, are eligible for </font><font>inclusion in the equity universe. REITs in some countries and certain income trusts in Canada are also eligible for inclusion.
</font><font>Each company and its securities (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., share classes) are classified in only one country.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Determining the Market Investable Equity Universe for Each Market.</font><font> The equity universe in any market is
derived by </font><font>applying investability screens to individual companies and securities in that market. Some investability requirements are </font><font>applied at the individual security level and some at the overall company level, represented by the aggregation of individual
</font><font>securities of the company. As a result, the inclusion or exclusion of one security does not imply the automatic inclusion or </font><font>exclusion of other securities of the same company.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Determining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market.</font><font> In order to create size components that
can be </font><font>meaningfully aggregated into composites, individual market size segments balance the following two objectives:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Achieving global size integrity by ensuring that companies of comparable and relevant sizes are
included in a given size </font><font>segment across all markets in a composite index; and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Achieving consistent market coverage by ensuring that each market's size segment is represented
in its proportional </font><font>weight in the composite universe.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Standard Indexes, Large Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small Cap Indexes capture the
following market </font><font>capitalization size segments:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>MSCI Global Standard Indexes cover all investable large- and mid-cap securities by including the largest issuers </font><font>comprising
approximately 85% of each market’s free float-adjusted market capitalization.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>MSCI Global Large Cap Indexes provide coverage of all investable large-cap securities by including the largest issuers
</font><font>comprising approximately 70% of each market’s free float-adjusted market capitalization.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes provide coverage in each market by deriving the difference between
the market coverage </font><font>of the MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI Global Large Cap Index in that market.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of companies with a market capitalization below
that of the companies </font><font>in the MSCI Global Standard Indexes.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Applying Final Size Segment Investability Requirements. </font><font>In order to enhance replicability of the indexes, additional size </font><font>segment investability requirements are set for the MSCI
GIMI and MSCI Global Standard Index. These investability </font><font>requirements include minimum free float-adjusted market capitalization, minimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and
</font><font>minimum length of trading.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Applying Index Continuity Rules for the Standard Index.</font><font> In order to achieve index continuity as well as
provide some basic </font><font>level of diversification within a market index, notwithstanding the effect of other index construction rules contained herein, a </font><font>minimum number of five constituents will be maintained for a developed market Standard Index and a minimum number of </font><font>three
constituents will be maintained for an emerging market Standard Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Weighting.</font><font> All indexes of the MSCI GIMI are free float weighted, </font><font>i.e.,</font><font> companies are included in the indexes at the value of </font><font>their free public float (free float multiplied by security price).</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Regional Weights.</font><font> Market capitalization-weighting, combined with a consistent target of approximately 99% of free float-adjusted</font><font> market
capitalization, helps ensure that each country's weight in regional and international indexes approximates its </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>weight in the total universe of developing and
emerging markets. A market is equivalent to a single country except for </font><font>developed Europe, where all markets are aggregated into a single market for index construction purposes.
Individual country </font><font>indexes of the European developed markets are derived from the constituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Free Float.</font><font> MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available </font><font>for
purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. In practice, limitations on free float available to </font><font>international investors include: (i) strategic and other
shareholdings not considered part of available free float; and (ii) limits </font><font>on share ownership for foreigners.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>MSCI calculates the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security in the equity
index universe by (i) defining and </font><font>estimating the free float available to foreign investors; (ii) assigning a free float-adjustment factor to each security; and (iii) </font><font>calculating the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Under MSCI's free float-adjustment methodology, a constituent's inclusion factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded
</font><font>up to the closest 5% for constituents with free float equal to or exceeding 15%. For example, a constituent security with a </font><font>free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its market capitalization. For securities with a free float of less than </font><font>15%, the estimated free float is adjusted to the nearest 1%.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Price and Exchange Rates</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Prices.</font><font> The prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes are the official exchange closing prices or those
figures accepted as </font><font>such. MSCI reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Exchange Rates.</font><font> MSCI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World </font><font>Markets/Reuters does
not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year's Day), </font><font>the previous business day's rates are normally used. MSCI independently
monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. </font><font>MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters </font><font>rates are not available, or if MSCI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances
</font><font>for a given currency on a particular day. In such circumstances, an announcement would be sent to clients with the related </font><font>information. If appropriate, MSCI may conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the </font><font>most
relevant exchange rate.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Changes to the Indexes.</font><font> The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of </font><font>the underlying equity
markets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes, emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and </font><font>minimizing turnover in the indexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves many
aspects, including: (i) additions to, and </font><font>deletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in number of shares; and (iii) changes in inclusion factors as a result of updated free </font><font>float estimates.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of changes:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Semi-Annual Index Reviews
(</font><font>“</font><font>SAIRs</font><font>”</font><font>), conducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable that systematically reassess the </font><font>various dimensions of the equity universe for
all markets;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Quarterly Index
Reviews (</font><font>“</font><font>QIRs</font><font>”</font><font>), aimed at promptly reflecting other significant market events; and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Ongoing event-related changes, such as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies,
reorganizations and other similar </font><font>corporate events, which generally are implemented in the indexes as they occur.</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div><font>Potential changes in the status of countries (stand-alone, frontier, emerging
and developed) follow their own implementation </font><font>time tables. In addition, reviews of company involvement in ESG controversies, when applicable, may differ by index and </font><font>severity of the ESG controversy as determined by MSCI.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MSCI conducts SAIRs generally as of the close of the last business day of May and November. During the SAIRs, MSCI </font><font>updates
the investable equity universe and reassesses size segmentation investability requirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs </font><font>generally as of the close of the last business day of February
and August. During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index </font><font>that were not captured at the time of their actual occurrence, but are significant enough to be included before the
next SAIR. </font><font>The results of the SAIR and QIR are generally announced at least ten business days in advance of implementation.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>All securities in the Global Investable Equity
Universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities </font><font>using the GICS. The GICS consists of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries.
Under the GICS, each company </font><font>is assigned to one unique sub-industry according to its principal business activity (generally defined as the business activity </font><font>that generates 60% or more of the company’s revenues). Narrower indexes may be derived based on industry classification,
</font><font>and may contain securities belonging to specific sectors, industry groups, industries, sub-industries or a combination thereof.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>MSCI 25/50 Indexes</font> <br/></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes (the </font><font>“</font><font>25/50 Indexes</font><font>”</font><font>) is a sub-index of either an MSCI Global Standard Index or an MSCI </font><font>GIMI. Their construction reflects the diversification
requirements applicable to RICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal </font><font>Revenue Code. MSCI uses the concept of
</font><font>“</font><font>group entities</font><font>”</font><font> for the concentration limits of the capping methodologies in the </font><font>25/50 Indexes. A group entity is a group of companies that
operate as an affiliated corporate group but may separately issue </font><font>listed securities. To determine
</font><font>“</font><font>group entities,</font><font>”</font><font> MSCI analyzes financial accounts of listed companies holding stakes of 20% </font><font>or more in other listed companies to determine
whether these stakes are controlling in nature. In certain cases, even in the </font><font>absence of consolidated accounts, MSCI may also consider two companies as belonging to the same group
entity where </font><font>there is reasonable evidence of control based on other information. The 25/50 Indexes are free float-adjusted market </font><font>capitalization-weighted indexes with a capping methodology applied to group entity weights so that no single group entity
</font><font>exceeds 25% of index weight, and all group entities with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the index </font><font>weight. A buffer of 10% of the value of each of these caps is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short
</font><font>term market movements between rebalances. As a result, at the point of constructing or rebalancing the 25/50 Indexes, the </font><font>weight of any single group entity cannot exceed 22.5% of the index weight and all group entities with weight above 4.5%
</font><font>cannot exceed 45% of the index weight. A software application called the Barra Optimizer is utilized to calculate the capped </font><font>index weights through an optimization function which is aimed at minimizing index turnover, tracking error and extreme
</font><font>deviation from the uncapped index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MSCI ACWI IMI Sustainable Water Transition Extended Capped Index</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 52</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Index Description.</font><font> The MSCI ACWI IMI Sustainable Water Transition Extended Capped Index is designed to reflect the </font><font>performance characteristics
of a subset of U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities selected from the MSCI ACWI Investable </font><font>Market Index (IMI) (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Parent Index</font><font>”</font><font>). The Underlying Index is composed of two sets of constituents: 1) companies that </font><font>provide, or have high exposure to,
water-focused products or services and derive at least 10% of their revenues from </font><font>“</font><font>sustainable
water</font><font>”</font><font> (the </font><font>“</font><font>water supply universe</font><font>”</font><font>), or 2) companies that
demonstrate relatively efficient water management </font><font>(the </font><font>“</font><font>water usage universe</font><font>”</font><font>), each as determined by
MSCI and described below. MSCI defines </font><font>“</font><font>sustainable water</font><font>”</font><font> as </font><font>products and services that address water
scarcity or water quality issues, including specialized wastewater treatment </font><font>chemicals, smart metering devices, drought-resistant seeds, wastewater filters, desalination equipment
and services, </font><font>maintenance of water distribution infrastructure, and construction of wastewater plants and stormwater systems. To assess </font><font>water management efficiency, MSCI calculates a water stress management score using metrics related to a company's water
</font><font>usage governance, strategy, targets and performance as well as water conflicts controversies.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Parent Index includes large-, mid- and small-capitalization representation across 23 developed markets and 24 emerging </font><font>markets countries.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> The Index Provider begins with the Parent Index and excludes the securities of issuers
that it identifies </font><font>as being involved in any of the business activities summarized below:</font></div> </div> <div>

processing, refining), intra-company sales and ownership of oil sands reserves with no associated </font><font>extraction revenue.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, the Index Provider excludes companies based on the following environmental- or sustainability-related criteria:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Companies that it determines are involved in </font><font>“</font><font>very severe</font><font>”</font><font> controversies related to the environmental, social or </font><font>governance (</font><font>“</font><font>ESG</font><font>”</font><font>) impact of the company’s operations and/or products and services. The Index Provider defines a </font><font>controversy as an
instance or ongoing situation in which company operations and/or products allegedly have a negative </font><font>ESG impact, including alleged violations of laws, regulations or accepted
international norms. To evaluate ESG </font><font>controversies, the Index Provider monitors across five categories of ESG impact – environment, human rights and </font><font>communities, labor rights and supply chain, customers and governance – and 28 sub-categories.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Companies that it

</font><font>can relate to, among other things, toxic emissions and waste, water stress, biodiversity and supply chain management.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Companies belonging to the bottom 25% of the environmental pillar of the MSCI ESG Ratings framework, relative to </font><font>their
relevant ESG Ratings industry. ESG Ratings industries are peer groups based on GICS sub-industries in which </font><font>companies face relatively similar key issues (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, water stress), as identified by the Index Provider.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Companies belonging to the bottom 25% of the water stress management score under the MSCI ESG Ratings </font><font>framework, as
determined by the Index Provider. A company’s water stress management score is based on its efforts to </font><font>manage water-related risks and opportunities through employing
water-efficient processes, alternative water sources or </font><font>water recycling.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Companies that are assessed as </font><font>“</font><font>strongly misaligned</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>misaligned</font><font>”</font><font> to any of three United Nations Sustainable
</font><font>Development Goals (</font><font>“</font><font>SDGs</font><font>”</font><font>): SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production; </font><font>and SDG 14, Life Below Water. MSCI scores SDG alignment on a scale of -10 to 10, where </font><font>“</font><font>strongly misaligned</font><font>”</font><font> means a </font><font>score of -10 and </font><font>“</font><font>misaligned</font><font>”</font><font> means a score equal to or less than -2 and greater than -10. The SDG Alignment </font><font>framework is built on the premise that companies may contribute to the goals in a variety of ways (positively and
</font><font>negatively) and across several impact areas. The alignment assessment considers revenues from products and services </font><font>with positive or negative impact as well as operational and performance metrics.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>For SDG 6,
companies are assessed on factors including water consumption or withdrawal targets, water reduction </font><font>programs in operations, water risk monitoring and measurement programs,
business exposure to water-intensive </font><font>or water-polluting operations and the production of water-polluting products such as pesticides and fertilizers.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>For SDG 12, companies are assessed on factors including revenues from fossil fuels, water
efficiency programs in </font><font>operations or the supply chain, more than 20% of revenues from products with high packaging waste and </font><font>freshwater withdrawal intensity trends.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>For SDG 14, companies are assessed on factors such as revenues from wastewater treatment or
environmental </font><font>remediation, certified sustainable seafood sourcing and more than 20% of revenues from offshore drilling, fishing </font><font>and aquaculture, products with high levels of packaging waste or marine transport, including cruises and freight
</font><font>transport.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>From the universe of issuers remaining after the exclusions are applied (the

described below.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Water Supply Universe. </font><font>Constituents in the water supply universe of the Underlying Index engage in, or have high exposure </font><font>to, one or more of the
business activities of water supply, water utilities, water treatment and water-related equipment. </font><font>Stocks that are mapped to the following GICS sub-industries are excluded from the
water supply universe: aluminum, copper, </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>47</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

equipment services, </font><font>exploration, production, storage and transportation.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>There are four possible ways for a company to be deemed to be engaged in, or have high
exposure to, the business activities </font><font>of water supply, water utilities, water treatment or water-related equipment and, therefore, included in the water supply </font><font>universe.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>First, all companies from the water utility GICS sub-industry are included.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Second, companies
with a </font><font>“</font><font>business segment
relevance</font><font>”</font><font> to water score of 25% or more, as determined by the Index </font><font>Provider, are included. The business segment relevance score represents the percentage of a company’s total revenues
</font><font>derived from water-based business segments. The Index Provider considers a business segment to be water-based if 1) </font><font>its name includes at least one instance of any of the key words </font><font>“</font><font>water,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>“</font><font>plumbing,</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>flow</font><font>”</font><font> or 2) the segment is </font><font>assigned to one of the
following Standard Industrial Classification codes: pumps and pumping equipment, plastics </font><font>plumbing fixtures, plumbing fixture fittings and trim, totalizing fluid meters and
counting devices, water well drilling, </font><font>sewerage system, air and water resource and solid waste management, water supply, or refuse systems.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Third, companies
within the GICS sectors of materials, information technology, industrials and utilities are included if </font><font>they have a </font><font>“</font><font>business description relevance</font><font>”</font><font> to water score of 75% or more, as determined by the Index Provider. For </font><font>companies in the GICS sub-industries of diversified
chemicals, specialty chemicals and electronic equipment, a </font><font>“</font><font>business description relevance</font><font>”</font><font> score of at least 25% is required for inclusion. The business description relevance score </font><font>is based primarily on the frequency of the key words </font><font>“</font><font>water,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>“</font><font>plumbing</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>flow</font><font>”</font><font> as a percentage of the total number </font><font>of words in
the company’s business description. To arrive at the relevance score, a company’s key word frequency </font><font>percentage is normalized relative to that of the company in the
Parent Index with the highest key word frequency </font><font>percentage greater than zero.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Fourth, companies that derive 25% or more revenues from </font><font>“</font><font>sustainable water</font><font>”</font><font> products and services (as defined above) </font><font>are included. Revenue figures associated with </font><font>“</font><font>sustainable water</font><font>”</font><font> activities are sourced from publicly available </font><font>information when available. Revenue figures may be estimated by the Index
Provider when companies do not report </font><font>exact revenue figures for </font><font>“</font><font>sustainable water</font><font>”</font><font> products and services; these
estimates are based on certain assumptions, </font><font>including that a given company's product lines are of equal weight in terms of revenue contribution in the absence of </font><font>information indicating otherwise.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As a final filter, companies that derive less than 10% of their revenues from
</font><font>“</font><font>sustainable water</font><font>”</font><font> products and services are </font><font>excluded from the water supply universe.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Water Usage Universe. </font><font>The water usage universe of the Underlying Index is constructed by selecting stocks from the filtered </font><font>universe that are not
part of the water supply universe. The water usage selection process generally focuses on certain sub-industries</font><font> within the GICS consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy,
information technology, materials and utilities </font><font>sectors and other companies for which water stress is a key issue, as determined by the Index Provider. These include, among </font><font>others, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, soft drinks, semiconductors, industrial gases, electric utilities and specialty chemicals. The </font><font>Index Provider uses water stress management scores, as calculated under the MSCI ESG Ratings framework, to identify
</font><font>companies that have better management strategies to address water stress, relative to their industry peers. The management </font><font>scores range from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates a lack of management and 10 indicates </font><font>“</font><font>best practice.</font><font>”</font><font> If the maximum water </font><font>stress management score in a particular sector is less than 5, that sector and all companies within it are excluded from the
</font><font>water usage universe.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A company’s water stress management score is based on the following
factors:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Governance and strategy (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
executive body responsible for water management strategy and performance, extent to </font><font>which the company has successfully implemented water-efficient production processes to reduce
water intensity, </font><font>percentage of water consumption from alternative water sources such as gray water, rainwater and sewage);</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Targets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, existence of targets to improve water consumption performance and their aggressiveness in the
context of </font><font>current performance, detailed implementation strategy for reduction in water use, demonstrated track record of </font><font>achieving water reduction targets);</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Performance (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, water intensity
trend (as a proportion of sales), water intensity vs. peers as measured by water </font><font>consumption, water withdrawal and intensity trends); and</font></div> </div>

controversies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, if a company is competing for water in a drought area).</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>A company's water intensity
is measured as the ratio of either its water withdrawal (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, water that is removed from a
surface </font><font>or ground source, some or all of which may be returned after its use in the company's processes) or its water consumption </font><font>(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, water that is removed for use
and not returned) relative to the company's sales (in USD millions).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
Index Provider then calculates a sector-relative version of the water stress management score by dividing the company’s </font><font>score by the highest score among other companies in
the same sector. Companies that are in the top 5% of the sector-relative</font><font> water stress management scores across the relevant set of sub-industries and companies are selected for the
water </font><font>usage universe.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities included in the Underlying Index are weighted within their respective universe
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, water supply or water usage) in </font><font>proportion to their free float-adjusted market capitalization, and the weights are then normalized to add up to 100% for the
</font><font>particular universe. The Index Provider targets a weight of 50% of the Underlying Index for each of the water supply and </font><font>water usage universes. The maximum weight of an issuer in its respective universe is 12%. The excess weight of any capped
</font><font>issuers is distributed among the remaining constituents within the relevant universe in proportion to their existing weights. </font><font>The aggregate weight of all issuers with an individual weight greater than 5% is capped at 50% of the Underlying Index.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Underlying Index is reconstituted and rebalanced semi-annually, as of the close of the last business day of May and </font><font>November, coinciding with the May and November Semi-Annual Index Reviews of the Parent Index. The Underlying Index is </font><font>also
reviewed quarterly. On a semi-annual basis, the Index Provider updates the filtered universe, the water supply universe </font><font>and the water usage universe and applies the relevant
weighting constraints within the two universes and across the </font><font>Underlying Index. At each quarterly review, existing constituents in the filtered universe are deleted from the
Underlying </font><font>Index if at that time they fall within an exclusions category, and the Underlying Index is reweighted to apply the 50% cap for </font><font>constituents with a greater than 5% weight. In addition, the Index Provider annually reviews the business segment selection
</font><font>criteria that are part of constructing the water supply universe.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Calculation Methodology</font><font>. The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested.
MSCI uses the </font><font>index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating </font><font>the net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate

<div> <div><font>Index Description.</font><font> The MSCI All Kuwait Select Size Liquidity Capped Index is designed to measure the performance of the </font><font>Kuwait equity
universe. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index with a capping </font><font>methodology applied to avoid concentration. The Underlying Index targets
to include at least 30 securities and 25 issuers. </font><font>MSCI begins with the MSCI Kuwait Index (the </font><font>“</font><font>Parent Index</font><font>”</font><font>), which consists of equity
securities of companies that (i) are </font><font>classified in Kuwait according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index Methodology, together with equity securities of </font><font>companies that (ii) are either headquartered or listed in Kuwait and carry out the majority of their operations in Kuwait
</font><font>(based on the geographic distribution of any of the following criteria: the company’s shareholder base, revenues, assets, </font><font>management, employee base, history and country of incorporation), as defined and measured by MSCI, or (iii) have an </font><font>economic
exposure (based on the geographic distribution of a company’s revenues) greater than 10% to Kuwait, as defined </font><font>and measured by MSCI, where the criteria outlined in (i) and
(ii) do not result in the target number of securities and issuers.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The MSCI
Global Investable Market Index Methodology generally classifies a company as being in Kuwait if it is incorporated </font><font>in Kuwait and its securities have a primary listing in Kuwait. In
the event that a company is incorporated outside of Kuwait but </font><font>its securities have a primary listing in Kuwait, MSCI will consider additional factors, including but not limited to
the </font><font>geographic distribution of the company's shareholder's base or operations, the location of its headquarters and the </font><font>company's history. In considering a company’s history, MSCI reviews where the company originated from when the company
</font><font>started its operations, as well as who the founders were and their nationality.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>MSCI generally applies a capping methodology to the Underlying Index so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% </font><font>of the Underlying Index weight, and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying
</font><font>Index weight. However, this capping methodology does not apply to constituents that (1) are not classified as large- or mid-capitalization</font><font> securities as per the MSCI Global Investment Market Index Methodology and (2) have a 3-month annual traded </font><font>value ratio
(</font><font>“</font><font>ATVR</font><font>”</font><font>) less than or equal to 20%. ATVR is a measure of traded value in a security as a proportion of its free </font><font>float-adjusted
market capitalization. Constituents meeting both of these criteria are represented at their weight in the Parent </font><font>Index, and therefore will not be subject to the capping methodology
of the Underlying Index discussed above.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Calculation
Methodology.</font><font> The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the
</font><font>index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating </font><font>the net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate
</font><font>of the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes </font><font>withheld at the rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such
</font><font>withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents.</font></div> </div> <div>

<div><font>Index Description</font><font>. The MSCI All Peru Capped Index is a free
float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index designed to </font><font>measure the performance of the </font><font>“</font><font>Broad Peru Equity Universe,</font><font>”</font><font> as defined by MSCI.
The Underlying Index targets a minimum </font><font>of 25 securities and 20 issuers.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> The Underlying Index consists of equity securities of
(i) companies that are classified in Peru according </font><font>to the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes Methodology and (ii) companies that are not classified in Peru but are either
</font><font>headquartered or listed in Peru and have a significant linkage to Peru, as determined by MSCI based on the company’s </font><font>shareholder base, revenues, assets, management, employee base, history and country of incorporation. If the criteria outlined
</font><font>in (i) and (ii) do not result in the target number of securities and issuers, the Underlying Index will also include securities of </font><font>companies with economic exposure of greater than 10% to Peru, as determined by MSCI based on the geographic </font><font>distribution of
a company’s revenues. The Broad Peru Equity Universe may include companies that are organized or listed, or </font><font>that have significant operations, in developed countries,
including the U.S. All listed Peruvian equity securities, or listed </font><font>Peruvian securities that exhibit characteristics of equity securities, except for mutual funds, ETFs, equity
derivatives, limited </font><font>partnerships, and most investment trusts, are eligible for inclusion in the Broad Peru Equity Universe.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology that limits the weight of any single </font><font>“</font><font>group entity</font><font>”</font><font> (constituents that MSCI </font><font>determines have a control relationship) to a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index weight, and the
sum of all group </font><font>entities with a weight above 5% to an aggregate of 50% of the Underlying Index weight. A group entity is a group of </font><font>companies that operate as an affiliated corporate group but may separately issue listed securities. To determine

nature. In certain cases, even in the absence of consolidated accounts, </font><font>MSCI may also consider two companies as belonging to the same group entity where there is reasonable
evidence of control </font><font>based on other information. All group entities are reviewed on an annual basis.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>At each quarterly rebalance, the weight of any single group entity is capped at 22.5%, and all group entities with a weight </font><font>greater than 4.5% are capped such that, in the aggregate, these group entities do not have a weight greater than 45% of the
</font><font>Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Underlying Index is reviewed annually, during which the Broad Peru Equity Universe is updated by identifying all eligible
</font><font>securities according to the criteria discussed above. Securities that are included in the Underlying Index on the basis of being </font><font>headquartered or listed in Peru and having a significant linkage to Peru are generally maintained unless the company is no
</font><font>longer headquartered or listed in Peru, or there has been a significant change in its geographic profile over time.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Calculation Methodology. </font><font>The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested.
MSCI uses the </font><font>index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating </font><font>the net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate
</font><font>of the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes </font><font>withheld at the rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such

<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 33</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Index Description.</font><font> The MSCI All Qatar Capped Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that is </font><font>designed to measure
the equity market in Qatar. The Underlying Index consists of equity securities of companies (i) that are </font><font>classified in Qatar according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index
Methodology, together with (ii) companies that are </font><font>not classified in Qatar according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index Methodology but are either headquartered or </font><font>listed in Qatar and carry out the majority of their operations in Qatar, as defined by MSCI, or (iii) that have economic
</font><font>exposure greater than 10% to Qatar, as defined by MSCI, where the criteria outlined in (i) and (ii) do not result in the target </font><font>number of securities and issuers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Underlying Index is rebalanced quarterly using an optimization process that aims to minimize the constituent weight
</font><font>differences between the Underlying Index and the MSCI Qatar Index. The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology that </font><font>limits the weight of any single </font><font>“</font><font>group

A group entity is a group of </font><font>companies that operate as an affiliated corporate
group but may separately issue listed securities. To determine </font><font>“</font><font>group </font><font>entities,</font><font>”</font><font> MSCI analyzes financial accounts of
listed companies holding stakes of 20% or more in other listed companies to </font><font>determine whether these stakes are controlling in nature. In certain cases, even in the absence of
consolidated accounts, </font><font>MSCI may consider two companies as belonging to the same group entity where there is reasonable evidence of control </font><font>based on other information. Between rebalancings, additions (if eligible) and deletions to the Underlying Index will be
</font><font>concurrent with the implementation in the Parent Index, and weights changes will be distributed pro rata among the </font><font>remaining constituents.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MSCI Emerging Markets Choice ESG Screened 5% Issuer Capped Index</font></div> </div> <div>

MSCI ESG Research defines a controversy as an instance or ongoing situation in which company operations </font><font>and/or products allegedly have a negative environmental, social and/or governance impact. Each controversy case is </font><font>assessed
for the severity of its impact to society. Companies are assigned a score (</font><font>“</font><font>MSCI Controversies
Score</font><font>”</font><font>) ranging from </font><font>0 to 10 with 0
being the most serious, and companies with a score lower than 3 are excluded.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MSCI ESG Research rates the ESG characteristics of securities on a scale of </font><font>“</font><font>CCC</font><font>”</font><font> (lowest) to </font><font>“</font><font>AAA</font><font>”</font><font> (highest). MSCI ESG </font><font>Research determines the ESG ratings by evaluating the company’s risks and opportunities and using
a sector-specific ESG </font><font>Key Issues
(</font><font>“</font><font>Key Issues</font><font>”</font><font>) (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, carbon emissions) selection
and weighting model. Each company is scored on a scale of 0 to </font><font>10, with 10 being the most desirable, for each applicable Key Issue before being provided an ESG rating based on
average Key </font><font>Issue score. ESG ratings are calculated in comparison to a company’s sector peers, and securities in one sector may have a </font><font>lower average ESG rating than securities in another sector. Only securities of companies with an ESG rating of
</font><font>“</font><font>BB</font><font>”</font><font> or higher </font><font>are eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Following these eligibility screens, companies are then ordered within each Global Industry

based </font><font>on free-float adjusted market capitalization. MSCI selects companies from the ranked universe until the constituents of the </font><font>Underlying Index represent approximately 50% of the free float-adjusted cumulative market capitalization of the respective
</font><font>sector of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Once all constituents are selected, MSCI next weighs the constituents according </font><font>to free float-adjusted market capitalization, limiting individual issuers to 5% of index weight, but does not revisit the 50%
</font><font>target sector coverage based on any resultant reweighting.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Index Description.</font><font> The MSCI Saudi Arabia IMI 25/50 Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that </font><font>incorporates
foreign ownership limits and is designed to measure the performance of the large-, mid- and small- </font><font>capitalization segments of the Saudi Arabia market. The Underlying Index is
rebalanced quarterly using an optimization </font><font>process that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the Underlying Index and the MSCI Saudi Arabia </font><font>Index. The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology that limits the weight of any single </font><font>“</font><font>group entity</font><font>”</font><font> (constituents </font><font>that MSCI determines have a control relationship) to a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index weight, and the sum of all

<div> <div><font>companies that operate as an affiliated corporate
group but may separately issue listed securities. To determine </font><font>“</font><font>group </font><font>entities,</font><font>”</font><font> MSCI analyzes financial accounts of
listed companies holding stakes of 20% or more in other listed companies to </font><font>determine whether these stakes are controlling in nature. In certain cases, even in the absence of
consolidated accounts, </font><font>MSCI may also consider two companies as belonging to the same group entity where there is reasonable evidence of control </font><font>based on other information. All group entities are reviewed on an annual basis. It also applies certain investment limits that
</font><font>are imposed on RICs under the current Internal Revenue Code. The Underlying Index covers approximately 99% of the free </font><font>float-adjusted market capitalization in Saudi Arabia.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Calculation Methodology. </font><font>The 25/50 Indexes take into account the investment limits required of RICs under
the current </font><font>Internal Revenue Code. One requirement of a RIC is that at the end of each quarter of its tax year no more than 25% of the </font><font>value of the RIC's assets may be invested in a single issuer and the sum of the weights of all issuers representing more than
</font><font>5% of the fund should not exceed 50% of the fund’s total assets.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The 25/50 Index methodology aims to minimize index turnover, tracking error and extreme
deviation from the parent index. </font><font>The indexes are rebalanced quarterly. Changes resulting from each rebalancing are made as of the close of the last business </font><font>day of February, May, August and November, coinciding with the quarterly index reviews of their parent indexes.</font></div> </div>

which cannot be changed </font><font>without the approval of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority </font><font>of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund is defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting
</font><font>securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund </font><font>are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each Fund has also
</font><font>adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. Non-fundamental investment </font><font>policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Therefore, each Fund may change its investment </font><font>objective

<div> <div><font>Notations Regarding each of the iShares ESG Advanced MSCI
EM ETF's, iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF's, iShares </font><font>MSCI China Multisector Tech ETF's, iShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF's,
iShares MSCI Kuwait </font><font>ETF's, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF's, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF's, iShares MSCI UAE ETF's and iShares MSCI Water </font><font>Management Multisector ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The following notations are not considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to </font><font>change without shareholder approval.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does </font><font>not
define what constitutes
</font><font>“</font><font>concentration</font><font>”</font><font> in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </font><font>more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </font><font>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration
could change in the future. The policy </font><font>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </font><font>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </font><font>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly,
</font><font>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </font><font>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the
</font><font>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </font><font>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications,
</font><font>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </font><font>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give
</font><font>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set
forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </font><font>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </font><font>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total
</font><font>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </font><font>each Fund to maintain at all times an </font><font>“</font><font>asset
coverage</font><font>”</font><font> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </font><font>means the ratio that the value of each Fund's total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than
</font><font>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </font><font>“</font><font>leveraging.</font><font>”</font><font> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </font><font>borrowings or
involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</font><font> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse
repurchase agreements and similar financing </font><font>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </font><font>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and comply with Rule
18f-4 </font><font>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </font><font>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and
</font><font>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the
Investment Company Act does not </font><font>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </font><font>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>assets under certain circumstances. Those
circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </font><font>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than
10% of the </font><font>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </font><font>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is
</font><font>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </font><font>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions
</font><font>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </font><font>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable
</font><font>law.</font></div> <div> <div><font>With
respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </font><font>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its
securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </font><font>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through
the purchase of </font><font>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward </font><font>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of
</font><font>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF, iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI China Multisector Tech ETF, </font><font>iShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF, iShares MSCI Kuwait ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares </font><font>MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF, iShares MSCI UAE ETF </font><font>and

<div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to </font><font>the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI India ETF </font><font>and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising
</font><font>management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, </font><font>which currently limits each Fund's holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund's net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings
</font><font>in illiquid investments pursuant to the Liquidity Program.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>If any percentage restriction described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in
</font><font>percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that certain </font><font>percentage limitations will be observed continuously in accordance with applicable law.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>All Funds</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, </font><font>under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
</font><font>purposes, in the component securities of its Underlying Index or in depositary receipts representing component securities in </font><font>its Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written </font><font>notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future </font><font>investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </font><font>extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end
</font><font>investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the
</font><font>“</font><font>fund of funds</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another
investment </font><font>company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental
investment policies apply </font><font>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </font><font>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not
</font><font>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </font><font>without undue market or tax consequences.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Continuous Offering</font></div>
<div> <div><font>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under
applicable securities laws. </font><font>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </font><font>“</font><font>distribution,</font><font>”</font><font> as such term </font><font>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on
their part may, </font><font>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </font><font>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it
takes Creation Units after placing </font><font>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </font><font>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand
</font><font>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </font><font>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </font><font>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as
</font><font>an underwriter.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> but are effecting transactions in
shares, </font><font>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </font><font>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </font><font>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are
</font><font>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </font><font>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the
</font><font>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </font><font>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Management</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Trustees and Officers. </font><font> </font><font>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </font><font>general supervision of the
duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </font><font>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office
until his or her successor is elected and </font><font>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </font><font>“</font><font>interested persons</font><font>”</font><font> (as defined in the 1940 </font><font>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</font><font>“</font><font>Independent Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock-advised Funds</font><font>”</font><font>) are organized into one
</font><font>complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Fixed-Income</font><font> Complex</font><font>”</font><font>) and one complex of ETFs (</font><font>“</font><font>Exchange-Traded Fund
Complex</font><font>”</font><font>) (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Fund Complex</font><font>”</font><font>). Each </font><font>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee
</font><font>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists </font><font>of 403 funds as of December 29, 2023. With the exception of Robert S. Kapito, Salim Ramji, Dominik Rohé and Aaron
</font><font>Wasserman, the address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The </font><font>address of Mr. Kapito, Mr. Ramji, Mr. Rohé and Mr. Wasserman is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001.
</font><font>The Board has designated John E. Kerrigan as its Independent Board Chair.

<div> <div><font>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside
at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </font><font>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to
conduct the </font><font>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </font><font>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </font><font>the
Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </font><font>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among
committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </font><font>enhance effective oversight.</font><font>
</font></div> <div> <div><font>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of
BFA or other service providers (depending on </font><font>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </font><font>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk
</font><font>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </font><font>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </font><font>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s
</font><font>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </font><font>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </font><font>dedicated
Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</font><font>“</font><font>RQA</font><font>”</font><font>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </font><font>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their
</font><font>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </font><font>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent
</font><font>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </font><font>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's
</font><font>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </font><font>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief
</font><font>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </font><font>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public
</font><font>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </font><font>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </font><font>The
Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </font><font>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in
which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </font><font>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</font></div> </div>

(collectively </font><font>referred to in this
section as </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock</font><font>”</font><font>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </font><font>and/or other accounts managed by
BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </font><font>described below.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </font><font>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment
</font><font>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</font><font> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are
</font><font>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
</font><font>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </font><font>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or
</font><font>sold by a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate
</font><font>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </font><font>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is
</font><font>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed-income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </font><font>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the
</font><font>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </font><font>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's
</font><font>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </font><font>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by
</font><font>the Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually
</font><font>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </font><font>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition,
</font><font>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or
</font><font>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </font><font>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts
</font><font>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </font><font>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </font><font>ahead
of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </font><font>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable
trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </font><font>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect
to </font><font>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </font><font>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </font><font>so.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conflicts may
also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </font><font>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short
position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or
its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </font><font>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and
therefore benefit) BlackRock or </font><font>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </font><font>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which
</font><font>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </font><font>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </font><font>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients
</font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>cross trades</font><font>”</font><font>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </font><font>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </font><font>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </font><font>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such
</font><font>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </font><font>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those
</font><font>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </font><font>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or
</font><font>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </font><font>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises.
</font><font>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </font><font>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </font><font>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock
</font><font>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from
engaging in other investment </font><font>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </font><font>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result,
</font><font>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </font><font>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached.
</font><font>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </font><font>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon
</font><font>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental
analysis and proprietary </font><font>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </font><font>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make
</font><font>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </font><font>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have
</font><font>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </font><font>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict
</font><font>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </font><font>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment
</font><font>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </font><font>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </font><font>and
by its advisory clients.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, certain principals and certain
employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </font><font>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees
may have obligations to such other </font><font>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </font><font>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest
in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </font><font>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the
counterparty, principal </font><font>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </font><font>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions.
</font><font>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </font><font>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority
</font><font>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </font><font>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially
</font><font>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for
underlying fixed-income </font><font>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </font><font>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the
</font><font>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </font><font>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative
</font><font>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </font><font>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative
</font><font>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </font><font>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity
</font><font>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </font><font>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests
</font><font>adverse to those of the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </font><font>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </font><font>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </font><font>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or
</font><font>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </font><font>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and
</font><font>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </font><font>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other
</font><font>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </font><font>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation
</font><font>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </font><font>amounts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When
BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </font><font>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may
have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </font><font>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not
have any </font><font>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </font><font>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent
to, and receives a share of securities </font><font>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </font><font>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program,
</font><font>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </font><font>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock
as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </font><font>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate
this conflict by </font><font>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </font><font>pro rata </font><font>allocation. </font></div> <div>
<div><font>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </font><font>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </font><font>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</font><font>“</font><font>shortfall risk</font><font>”</font><font>) in the securities lending
program. BlackRock establishes </font><font>program-wide borrower limits (</font><font>“</font><font>credit limits</font><font>”</font><font>) to actively manage
borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </font><font>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type
and </font><font>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </font><font>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of
</font><font>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </font><font>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans
</font><font>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation over time. In order to allocate </font><font>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits
</font><font>(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> indemnification
exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </font><font>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have
enough inventory, either on its own or when </font><font>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </font><font>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal
</font><font>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </font><font>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </font><font>the firm.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </font><font>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules,
</font><font>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </font><font>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </font><font>loans overall.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </font><font>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different
</font><font>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </font><font>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or
</font><font>required, or in cases involving client direction.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of
</font><font>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </font><font>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of
</font><font>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </font><font>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or
</font><font>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </font><font>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to
</font><font>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </font><font>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy
</font><font>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </font><font>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock
</font><font>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </font><font>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other
</font><font>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </font><font>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions
</font><font>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </font><font>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>may be provided to the Funds and to such other
BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </font><font>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </font><font>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a
</font><font>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </font><font>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be
</font><font>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to
</font><font>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </font><font>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to
</font><font>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </font><font>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and
</font><font>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </font><font>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </font><font>conflicts
related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may utilize
certain electronic crossing networks (</font><font>“</font><font>ECNs</font><font>”</font><font>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </font><font>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing
client</font><font> </font><font>securities transactions for </font><font>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The
</font><font>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </font><font>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </font><font>may be
paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </font><font>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume
discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client
</font><font>transactions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>MEMX</font><font>”</font><font>), a newly created U.S. stock </font><font>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </font><font>for
execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </font><font>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the
appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock has adopted
policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </font><font>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to
help ensure that such decisions are made in </font><font>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </font><font>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or
</font><font>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </font><font>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </font><font>Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy</font><font>
section of this SAI.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately
</font><font>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </font><font>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to
</font><font>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </font><font>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund
</font><font>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </font><font>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </font><font>listing requirements for the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has
</font><font>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </font><font>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </font><font>sale
of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</font><font> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the
course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's
flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </font><font>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of
BlackRock have an investment.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With
</font><font>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </font><font>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other
</font><font>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </font><font>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </font><font>also
benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </font><font>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to
BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </font><font>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds
or </font><font>products.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to,
</font><font>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </font><font>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships
</font><font>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </font><font>provide services to a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the
</font><font>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </font><font>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other
</font><font>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </font><font>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing
</font><font>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </font><font>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As disclosed in more detail in the </font><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font><font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </font><font>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each
Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </font><font>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and
acts through </font><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </font><font>“</font><font>2a-5 Committee</font><font>”</font><font>), with assistance from other BFA
pricing committees and in accordance </font><font>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </font><font>“</font><font>Valuation Procedures</font><font>”</font><font>). When determining a
</font><font>“</font><font>fair value price,</font><font>”</font><font> the 2a-5 Committee </font><font>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in </font><font>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </font><font>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value
</font><font>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </font><font>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a
</font><font>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </font><font>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </font><font>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </font><font>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic
</font><font>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </font><font>receives an asset-based fee.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money
</font><font>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </font><font>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</font><font> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </font><font>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and
</font><font>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </font><font>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely
</font><font>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </font><font>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </font><font>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on
the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </font><font>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a
duplicating fee, by </font><font>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a
</font><font>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </font><font>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to
</font><font>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </font><font>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or
</font><font>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </font><font>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or
</font><font>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </font><font>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </font><font>BlackRock
may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </font><font>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies
for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </font><font>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services
for a </font><font>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </font><font>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, in connection
with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </font><font>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes
to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </font><font>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of
appropriate </font><font>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </font><font>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the
</font><font>issuer.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment
</font><font>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </font><font>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to
</font><font>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </font><font>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds)
</font><font>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </font><font>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </font><font>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of
</font><font>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </font><font>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </font><font>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </font><font>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
</font><font>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </font><font>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and
</font><font>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any
</font><font>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </font><font>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection
</font><font>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </font><font>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an
</font><font>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </font><font>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions
</font><font>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </font><font>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </font><font>to such security or asset.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized
Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </font><font>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds
that seek to track the performance of securities indices </font><font>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent
</font><font>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. In instances where BlackRock </font><font>charges a unitary management fee, BlackRock may have a financial incentive to use a BlackRock index that is less costly to
</font><font>BlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing </font><font>acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are
</font><font>under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured </font><font>that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a
Fund (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, custodians,
</font><font>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </font><font>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </font><font>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </font><font>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying service providers out of its fees that it receives </font><font>from the Funds, the benefits of lower fees, including any fee discounts or concessions, or any additional savings, may accrue,
</font><font>in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service </font><font>providers to a Fund. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to contractual arrangements with third-party
</font><font>service providers to a Fund, or the selection of such providers, particularly in circumstances where BlackRock is negotiating </font><font>on behalf of both funds that have a unitary management fee and those that do not or different service providers have
</font><font>different fee structures.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conflicts of interest may arise as a result of simultaneous investment management of multiple client accounts by the
</font><font>BlackRock’s investment professionals. For example, differences in the advisory fee structure may create the appearance of </font><font>actual or potential conflicts of interest because such differences could create pecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor one </font><font>client account over another.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </font><font>systems
used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </font><font>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and
funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </font><font>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for
the </font><font>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </font><font>profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of
systems provided by BlackRock may create </font><font>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock
may offer special pricing arrangements </font><font>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </font><font>a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </font><font>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </font><font>Distribution Services</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Investment Adviser. </font><font> </font><font>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between
</font><font>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </font><font>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory
</font><font>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </font><font>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and

may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </font><font>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to
perform investment </font><font>advisory or other services with respect to the Funds. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory </font><font>functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law.
</font><font>BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at </font><font>any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</font></div> <div> <div><font>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost
</font><font>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </font><font>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of
</font><font>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </font><font>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The following describes the calculation of the management fee for each Fund whose management
fee is subject to </font><font>breakpoints. The management fee for all Funds is set forth in the table that follows the description of breakpoints.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>For its investment advisory services to the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI
China ETF, iShares MSCI China </font><font>Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, and iShares MSCI UAE ETF, BFA is paid a </font><font>management fee from such Funds corresponding to each Fund’s allocable portion of an aggregate management fee
</font><font>calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares Funds: iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, iShares </font><font>MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Chile ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI
</font><font>Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Israel ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF, iShares </font><font>MSCI Poland ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares MSCI Russia ETF, iShares MSCI South Africa ETF, iShares MSCI South </font><font>Korea
ETF, iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF, iShares MSCI Thailand ETF, iShares MSCI Turkey ETF and iShares MSCI UAE ETF. The </font><font>aggregate management fee is calculated as follows: 0.7400% per annum
of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to </font><font>$2.0 billion, plus 0.6900% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $2.0 billion, up to and including $4.0 billion, plus </font><font>0.6400% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $4.0 billion, up to and including $8.0 billion, plus 0.5700% per annum </font><font>of
the aggregate net assets over $8.0 billion, up to and including $16.0 billion, plus 0.5100% per annum of the aggregate net </font><font>assets over $16.0 billion, up to and including $24.0
billion, plus 0.4800% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $24.0 </font><font>billion, up to and including $32.0 billion, plus 0.4500% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $32.0
billion, up to and </font><font>including $40.0 billion, plus 0.4275% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $40.0 billion. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>For its investment advisory services to the iShares MSCI India ETF, BFA is paid a management
fee from the iShares MSCI India </font><font>ETF calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the iShares MSCI India ETF. The aggregate management </font><font>fee is calculated as follows: 0.6500% per annum of the net assets less than or equal to $4.0 billion, plus 0.6175% per annum
</font><font>of the net assets over $4.0 billion, up to and including $6.0 billion, plus 0.5867% per annum of the net assets over $6.0 </font><font>billion, up to and including $8.0 billion, plus 0.5573% per annum of the net assets in excess of $8.0 billion.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the
Total Annual Fund Operating </font><font>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be </font><font>eliminated by BFA at any time. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The following table sets forth the management fees (net of any applicable waivers) each Fund paid BFA for the fiscal years

<div> <div><font>Pursuant to BFA’s policy, investment
opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and </font><font>accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due
to limited supply in </font><font>the market, legal constraints or other factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among </font><font>those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to </font><font>time
each Fund may receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than it would have if the Portfolio Managers </font><font>and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or
accounts.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day </font><font>portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory
services. One or </font><font>more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in </font><font>addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA
</font><font>or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio’s or account’s gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than </font><font>would otherwise be the case if BFA or any of its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based
</font><font>fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more </font><font>investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or
</font><font>accounts, in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and each of its affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and </font><font>opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intend to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that,
</font><font>as with any group of portfolios and accounts managed by an investment adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee </font><font>arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict of interest, which may
</font><font>result in the Portfolio Managers favoring those portfolios or accounts with performance-based fee arrangements.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The tables below show, for each Portfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or accounts of
the types set forth in the above </font><font>tables and the aggregate of total assets in those portfolios or accounts with respect to which the investment management </font><font>fees are based on the performance of those portfolios or accounts</font><font> </font><font>as of August 31, 2023:</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its
portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path </font><font>emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a
variety of </font><font>components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation </font><font>include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more
</font><font>of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other
</font><font>benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive </font><font>compensation, determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of </font><font>the
portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the </font><font>team relative to the portfolios’ investment
objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its </font><font>Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall
performance of these portfolios and </font><font>BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion </font><font>represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be
</font><font>granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term </font><font>shareholders and motivate performance.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As of August 31, 2023, the Portfolio Managers beneficially owned shares of the Funds, for which they are primarily

Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units </font><font>are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the </font><font>applicable Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both
</font><font>orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer</font><font> registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>1934 Act</font><font>”</font><font>), and a member of the Financial </font><font>Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund
provides that it may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any </font><font>penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a
majority of the Independent </font><font>Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. </font><font>The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</font></div> </div>

<div><font>Securities Lending. </font><font> </font><font>To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending </font><font>pursuant to SEC exemptive
relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of </font><font>BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the </font><font>“</font><font>Securities Lending Agency
Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its </font><font>services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the
</font><font>reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to </font><font>and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities
</font><font>lending, including custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each Fund is responsible for fees in connection with the investment of cash </font><font>collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the </font><font>“</font><font>collateral investment fees</font><font>”</font><font>); however, </font><font>BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral
</font><font>investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales </font><font>load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination
</font><font>of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be </font><font>subject to a different fee arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</font></div> </div> <div>

Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </font><font>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds (including, if applicable, any underlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-traded</font><font> products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of </font><font>owning,
the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ </font><font>participation in activities that are designed to make registered
representatives, other professionals and individual investors </font><font>more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other
activities, </font><font>such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development </font><font>of technology platforms and reporting systems

relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded </font><font>products (</font><font>“</font><font>Publishing Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). In addition, BFA Entities

<div> <div><font>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that
Intermediaries pay to your </font><font>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </font><font>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its
</font><font>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </font><font>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </font><font>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded</font><font> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </font><font>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </font><font>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related
</font><font>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </font><font>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its

<div> <div><font>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition
to payments for Education </font><font>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC
(</font><font>“</font><font>FBS</font><font>”</font><font>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </font><font>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>NFS</font><font>”</font><font>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </font><font>long-term and significant arrangement (the </font><font>“</font><font>Marketing Program</font><font>”</font><font>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </font><font>“</font><font>Fidelity</font><font>”</font><font>) have agreed, among other things, to
actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </font><font>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer
certain iShares funds in </font><font>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </font><font>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other
</font><font>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment
</font><font>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </font><font>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS
</font><font>and NFS during the wind-down period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties
</font><font>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </font><font>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology
</font><font>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made
</font><font>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </font><font>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the
</font><font>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </font><font>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital

<div><font>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </font><font>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the
</font><font>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </font><font>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with
</font><font>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </font><font>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid
</font><font>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Valuation of Shares. </font><font>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours
on the New York </font><font>Stock Exchange
(</font><font>“</font><font>NYSE</font><font>”</font><font>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </font><font>by a Fund is as
follows:</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Equity Investments. </font><font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </font><font>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous
transaction pricing information (each an </font><font>“</font><font>Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an
</font><font>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </font><font>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If
</font><font>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </font><font>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a
</font><font>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </font><font>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </font><font>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are
customized) for </font><font>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </font><font>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an
</font><font>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </font><font>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </font><font>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </font><font>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </font><font>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </font><font>may
incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </font><font>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as
of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </font><font>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with
</font><font>the Valuation Procedures.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Underlying Funds. </font><font>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV.
Shares of </font><font>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Valuation Information. </font><font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </font><font>makers to value a Fund’s
securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </font><font>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation
is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </font><font>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </font><font>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </font><font>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </font><font>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be
</font><font>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s
ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </font><font>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair
value.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the event that application of the methods of valuation
discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </font><font>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the
direction of or in </font><font>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </font><font>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted
</font><font>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </font><font>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference
between the prices used to calculate </font><font>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in its Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </font><font>performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fair Value.</font><font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a
Fund’s investments are </font><font>valued at fair value (</font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Assets</font><font>”</font><font>). Fair Value Assets are valued
by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </font><font>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </font><font>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market
</font><font>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </font><font>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is
</font><font>unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where
it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </font><font>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or
where the security or other asset or liability is only </font><font>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this
</font><font>purpose, a </font><font>“</font><font>significant event</font><font>”</font><font> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </font><font>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </font><font>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or
</font><font>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </font><font>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </font><font>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or
</font><font>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated,
systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of </font><font>a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing </font><font>methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the
</font><font>local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and
approving methodologies by investment type and significant </font><font>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA
by periodically </font><font>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </font><font>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </font><font>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that
a Fund might reasonably expect </font><font>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </font><font>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an
</font><font>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </font><font>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined
</font><font>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an
</font><font>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </font><font>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </font><font>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.

comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </font><font>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the
fair value of an </font><font>investment.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at
which those assets or liabilities could </font><font>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </font><font>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </font><font>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </font><font>accepted in the United States of America (</font><font>“</font><font>US
GAAP</font><font>”</font><font>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </font><font>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>ASC 820</font><font>”</font><font>), which defines and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </font><font>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </font><font>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market
</font><font>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </font><font>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </font><font>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Brokerage Transactions</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution
of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </font><font>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </font><font>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage
</font><font>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </font><font>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily
</font><font>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily
</font><font>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </font><font>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In
</font><font>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA
</font><font>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services
provided.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable
</font><font>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </font><font>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii)
</font><font>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </font><font>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of
</font><font>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </font><font>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </font><font>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of
</font><font>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </font><font>other circumstances.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Section 28(e)</font><font>”</font><font>) permits a U.S. investment
adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </font><font>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </font><font>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research
</font><font>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </font><font>under certain conditions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may
</font><font>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </font><font>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will
</font><font>provide research </font><font>“</font><font>credits</font><font>”</font><font> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </font><font>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions
involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on </font><font>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the
Funds in the form of </font><font>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </font><font>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S.,
</font><font>will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</font></div> <div> <div><font>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally
</font><font>traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </font><font>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or
</font><font>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </font><font>will generally include a </font><font>“</font><font>spread,</font><font>”</font><font> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </font><font>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </font><font>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such
</font><font>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </font><font>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such
</font><font>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </font><font>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940
</font><font>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </font><font>Act.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Purchases of
money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </font><font>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such
transactions because money market instruments are </font><font>generally traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis with dealers acting as principal for
their own accounts without a stated commission. The </font><font>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </font><font>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions,
</font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the
underwriter, generally referred </font><font>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </font><font>commissions or discounts are paid.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made
</font><font>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </font><font>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </font><font>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration
</font><font>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </font><font>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an
</font><font>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </font><font>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations:
</font><font>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </font><font>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or
</font><font>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </font><font>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client
</font><font>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </font><font>in which the Funds may invest.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Initial public offerings
(</font><font>“</font><font>IPOs</font><font>”</font><font>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </font><font>market. When BFA is given an
opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </font><font>“</font><font>new</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>hot</font><font>”</font><font> issue, the supply of securities </font><font>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to
</font><font>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </font><font>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </font><font>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </font></div> </div> </div> <div>
</div> <div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_2ea24903-f2a8-4735-958e-ae1a47775d68_106"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>particular client accounts that are managed by
portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </font><font>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the
case of international </font><font>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </font><font>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> basis. This
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if
pro-rating had not </font><font>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </font><font>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the
</font><font>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </font><font>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are
</font><font>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </font><font>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those
</font><font>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </font><font>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </font><font>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold,
</font><font>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </font><font>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If
</font><font>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </font><font>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made,
</font><font>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </font><font>“</font><font>bunch</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of
affiliates. In general, all </font><font>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </font><font>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a
</font><font>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </font><font>pro </font><font>rata</font><font> among the
clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </font><font>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all
accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </font><font>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases
this practice </font><font>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </font><font>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </font><font>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold,
</font><font>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </font><font>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a
</font><font>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </font><font>order.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The table
below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </font><font>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</font><font> </font><font>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </font><font>over those periods</font><font> </font><font>or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</font></div> </div> <div><font> </font></div>

broker-dealers for purchases of Deposit Securities (as defined below under </font><font>Fund Deposit</font><font>) or
sales of Fund Securities (as </font><font>defined below under </font><font>Redemption of Creation Units</font><font>) as applicable. Such transactions with a particular broker-dealer may be </font><font>conditioned upon the broker-dealer’s
agreement to transact at guaranteed price levels in order to reduce transaction costs </font><font>the Funds would otherwise incur as a consequence of settling creation or redemption baskets in
cash rather than in-kind.</font> <br/><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Following each Fund’s receipt of an order to purchase or redeem creation or redemption baskets, to the extent such
</font><font>purchases or redemptions consist of a cash portion, the Fund will enter an order with a broker or dealer to purchase or sell </font><font>the Deposit Securities or Fund Securities, as applicable. The terms of such order may, depending on the timing of the
</font><font>transaction and certain other factors, require the broker or dealer to guarantee that a Fund will achieve execution of its order </font><font>at a price at least as favorable to the Fund as the Fund’s valuation of the Deposit Securities/Fund Securities used for
</font><font>purposes of calculating the NAV applied to the creation or redemption transaction giving rise to the order (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Execution </font><font>Performance
Guarantee</font><font>”</font><font>). Such orders may be placed with the purchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant (or a
broker-dealer</font><font> affiliated with the Authorized Participant or a third-party broker-dealer engaged through the Authorized Participant) in </font><font>its capacity as a broker-dealer. The amount payable to each Fund in respect of any Execution Performance Guarantee will
</font><font>depend on the results achieved by the executing firm and will vary depending on market activity, timing and a variety of other </font><font>factors. The Execution Performance Guarantee will apply for any orders executed by the Authorized Participant (or an
</font><font>affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), even if the trades have not settled before the redemption transaction settles.</font> <br/><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be honored on orders arising from creation transactions executed by </font><font>an Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), an Authorized Participant is required to deposit an </font><font>amount with the Funds (the </font><font>“</font><font>Execution Performance
Deposit</font><font>”</font><font>). If the broker-dealer executing the order achieves executions </font><font>in market transactions at a price more favorable than the Funds' valuation of the Deposit Securities, then the Authorized
</font><font>Participant generally may retain the benefit of the favorable executions, and the Funds will return to the Authorized </font><font>Participant the Execution Performance Deposit. If, however, the broker-dealer executing the order is unable to achieve
</font><font>executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to the Fund’s valuation of the securities, the Funds retain the </font><font>portion of the Execution Performance Deposit equal to the full amount of the execution shortfall (including any taxes,
</font><font>brokerage commissions or other costs) and may require the Authorized Participant to deposit any additional amount required </font><font>to cover the full amount of the actual Execution Performance Guarantee. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To ensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee will be honored for brokerage orders arising from redemption </font><font>transactions
executed by an Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer) as broker-dealer, an </font><font>Authorized Participant agrees to pay the shortfall amount (the </font><font>“</font><font>Execution Performance Offset</font><font>”</font><font>). If the broker-dealer </font><font>executing the order achieves executions in market transactions at a price more favorable than the
Funds' valuation of the </font><font>Fund Securities, then the Authorized Participant generally may retain the benefit of the favorable executions and the </font><font>Authorized Participant is not called upon to honor the Execution Performance Offset.

<div><font>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Shares.</font><font>  </font><font>The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional </font><font>iShares
funds.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each share issued by a fund has a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, </font><font>subscription or conversion rights and are freely
transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and </font><font>distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable
assets of such fund on </font><font>liquidation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to
</font><font>shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote </font><font>together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than
</font><font>one fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the
</font><font>1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 </font><font>Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under
</font><font>Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of </font><font>trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a </font><font>“</font><font>control person</font><font>”</font><font> of the fund, as defined in Rule
0-1 under the 1940 </font><font>Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, </font><font>Princeton, NJ 08540.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a
</font><font>fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In </font><font>addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial </font><font>owners of 10% of the shares of a fund
(</font><font>“</font><font>Insiders</font><font>”</font><font>) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale </font><font>provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and
the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should </font><font>consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of
the 1934 Act and existing </font><font>guidance provided by the SEC staff.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the </font><font>“</font><font>Declaration of Trust</font><font>”</font><font>), the Board may, </font><font>without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,
</font><font>including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or </font><font>take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the affirmative
vote of a majority of the </font><font>shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the </font><font>Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable
</font><font>upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power </font><font>to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in </font><font>its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>be individually redeemable. In such circumstance,
the Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a </font><font>combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a
fund might elect </font><font>to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated </font><font>minimum amount.</font></div> <div> <div><font>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </font><font>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on
behalf of, DTC.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (</font><font>“</font><font>DTC Participants</font><font>”</font><font>), and </font><font>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a
single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central </font><font>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within
The Depository </font><font>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>DTCC</font><font>”</font><font>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </font><font>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </font><font>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities,
</font><font>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </font><font>Participant, either directly or indirectly
(</font><font>“</font><font>Indirect
Participants</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </font><font>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are
</font><font>referred to herein as </font><font>“</font><font>Beneficial
Owners</font><font>”</font><font>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </font><font>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
</font><font>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </font><font>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </font><font>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </font><font>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the
</font><font>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </font><font>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each
</font><font>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </font><font>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication,
</font><font>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
</font><font>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </font><font>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses
</font><font>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </font><font>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </font><font>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its
</font><font>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </font><font>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </font><font>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </font><font>“</font><font>street name,</font><font>”</font><font> and will be the responsibility of
such DTC Participants.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or
</font><font>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </font><font>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC
</font><font>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </font><font>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any
</font><font>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </font><font>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable
</font><font>cost.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Distribution of Shares. </font><font> </font><font>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </font><font>Creation Units by each Fund to

<div><font>Selling Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on </font><font>any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in

<div> <div><font>Fund Deposit.</font><font>  </font><font>The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund (except for the iShares MSCI Brazil
Small-Cap ETF, </font><font>iShares MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Kuwait ETF and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF </font><font>(each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Fund</font><font>”</font><font> and collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Funds</font><font>”</font><font>), which are generally offered in
Creation Units solely for cash), </font><font>generally consists of Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit </font><font>Securities and the Cash Component constitute the
</font><font>“</font><font>Fund Deposit,</font><font>”</font><font> which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio </font><font>securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective
investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. </font><font>The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such
</font><font>Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given </font><font>Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Cash Component is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the
</font><font>“</font><font>Deposit Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </font><font>differences
between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </font><font>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit
Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </font><font>Participant purchasing a Creation Unit. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each Cash Fund’s current policy is to accept cash in substitution for the Deposit
Securities it might otherwise accept as in-kind</font><font> consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. A Cash Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit Securities (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the </font><font>in-kind deposit of a
designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation </font><font>Units. If a Cash Fund elects to accept Deposit Securities, a purchaser's
delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the </font><font>Cash Component will constitute the </font><font>“</font><font>Fund Deposit,</font><font>”</font><font> which will represent the
consideration for a Creation Unit of the Fund. </font><font>The iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF, iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China </font><font>Multisector Tech ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF, iShares </font><font>MSCI
Peru and Global Exposure ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares MSCI UAE ETF and iShares MSCI Water Management </font><font>Multisector ETF (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Partial Cash Fund</font><font>”</font><font> and collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>Partial Cash Funds</font><font>”</font><font>) generally offer Creation Units partially </font><font>for
cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Please see the </font><font>Cash Purchase </font><font>Method</font><font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for further
information on </font><font>purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The identity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's
</font><font>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to </font><font>the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments
</font><font>to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the
cash to the Deposit Securities </font><font>portion of the Fund Deposit through </font><font>“</font><font>systematic rounding.</font><font>”</font><font> The rounding methodology
</font><font>“</font><font>rounds up</font><font>”</font><font> position sizes of </font><font>securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology
limits the maximum </font><font>allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to
reflect revisions that account for </font><font>index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any </font><font>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when
instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </font><font>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below);
(iii) when </font><font>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </font><font>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an
</font><font>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </font><font>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Cash Purchase Method. </font><font> </font><font>Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its
</font><font>funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified (Creation Units of the Cash Funds are </font><font>generally offered solely for cash, while Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally offered partially for cash), they </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>will be effected in essentially the same manner as
in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the </font><font>Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be
required to provide </font><font>through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser. The Authorized </font><font>Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees and charges for cash purchases, as described below, and, if
</font><font>transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price </font><font>movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage
Transactions</font><font> section of this </font><font>SAI.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </font><font>the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a
</font><font>“</font><font>Participating Party,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a
broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process </font><font>through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </font><font>“</font><font>Clearing Process</font><font>”</font><font>), a clearing agency that is registered </font><font>with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with
the Distributor, with respect to creations </font><font>and redemptions of Creation Units (</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized Participant Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>) (discussed
below). A member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an
</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized
Participant.</font><font>”</font><font> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name
of Cede </font><font>&amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Role of the Authorized Participant.</font><font>  </font><font>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC,
which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation
Units</font><font> </font><font>(an
</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized </font><font>Participant</font><font>”</font><font>). Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on
</font><font>behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will </font><font>make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the </font><font>NAV of
a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction </font><font>fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on
behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an </font><font>agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash
Component. </font><font>Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors </font><font>should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized </font><font>Participant
Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an </font><font>Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through
an Authorized Participant may result in additional </font><font>charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a </font><font>small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The
</font><font>Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available </font><font>to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact
</font><font>with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may </font><font>be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized
</font><font>Participant Agreement.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Purchase Orders.</font><font>
 </font><font> Unless otherwise described below, to initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must </font><font>submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper
form,</font><font> </font><font>generally before 4:00 </font><font>p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the
</font><font>custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and </font><font>requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants
</font><font>and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements </font><font>for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current </font><font>Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant
</font><font>should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff </font><font>Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement
date, by means satisfactory to </font><font>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </font><font>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing
</font><font>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </font><font>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be
aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of </font><font>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized
Participant.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses
and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash </font><font>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </font><font>of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders
</font><font>must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to </font><font>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or
</font><font>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders </font><font>to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a
</font><font>weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline </font><font>specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's </font><font>“</font><font>Cutoff Time.</font><font>”</font><font> The Distributor or its agent,
</font><font>in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any </font><font>time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the facilities of
</font><font>the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if </font><font>accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a </font><font>Fund's
Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </font><font>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either
on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </font><font>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due,
the Funds will </font><font>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </font><font>as set forth below.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </font><font>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a
</font><font>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </font><font>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a
</font><font>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </font><font>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the
</font><font>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </font><font>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</font><font>e.g</font><font>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </font><font>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and
BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </font><font>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting
on behalf of such </font><font>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </font><font>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them
</font><font>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, the Trust may exercise its right to reject any creation order for shares of the iShares MSCI India ETF and iShares </font><font>MSCI India Small-Cap ETF on any Business Day that is a holiday in the Indian market, but not a holiday observed in the U.S.
</font><font>equity market, and certain other holidays during the settlement cycle for Fund shares, in order to protect Fund shareholders </font><font>from any dilutive costs that may be associated with the purchase of Deposit Securities in connection with creation orders on
</font><font>such days.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</font><font>  </font><font> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </font><font>the applicable Fund of
the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</font><font> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund
Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </font><font>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </font><font>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit.

MSCI </font><font>Kuwait ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a </font><font>“</font><font>T+3 basis</font><font>”</font><font> (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, three Business Days after trade date). However, each </font><font>Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3, including a shorter settlement
</font><font>period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund </font><font>reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3 in order to accommodate non-U.S.
</font><font>market holiday schedules, to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and </font><font>ex-dividend dates (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the last day
the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the </font><font>security) and in certain other circumstances.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each
Fund will issue Creation Units </font><font>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </font><font>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </font><font>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set
</font><font>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </font><font>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual
</font><font>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </font><font>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing
</font><font>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </font><font>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </font><font>and other charges.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </font><font>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the
</font><font>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </font><font>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </font><font>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer, processing and other
transaction costs associated with </font><font>the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged on each Creation Unit created by an </font><font>Authorized Participant on the day of the transaction. The standard creation transaction fee is generally fixed at the amount
</font><font>shown in the table below regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, but may be reduced by a Fund if </font><font>transfer and processing expenses associated with the creation are anticipated to be lower than the stated fee.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>If a purchase consists of a cash portion, the Authorized Participant may also be required to
pay an additional transaction </font><font>charge (up to the maximum amount shown below) to cover brokerage and certain other costs related to the creation </font><font>transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants
</font><font>will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation </font><font>transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial
</font><font>intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard creation transaction fee and maximum additional charge (as described </font><font>above):</font></div> </div> <div><font> </font></div>

<div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>If a purchase consists of a cash
portion and each Fund places a brokerage transaction to purchase portfolio securities with </font><font>the Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the
Authorized Participant may be required, in its </font><font>capacity as broker-dealer with respect to that transaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, and </font><font>price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage
Transactions </font><font>section of </font><font>this SAI.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Redemption of Creation Units. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their </font><font>NAV next determined after
receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on a </font><font>Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units.
There can be no assurance, however, </font><font>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors </font><font>should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of
shares</font><font> </font><font>to constitute a </font><font>Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary
</font><font>market.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Cash Fund generally redeems Creation Units solely for cash. However, each Cash Fund reserves the right to distribute
</font><font>securities in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. Each Partial Cash Fund generally redeems Creation Units </font><font>partially for cash. Please see the </font><font>Cash Redemption Method</font><font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind</font><font> method for further information on redeeming Creation
Units of the Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund publishes the designated portfolio of
securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be </font><font>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on
that day (</font><font>“</font><font>Fund </font><font>Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Redemption Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), and an amount of cash (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Cash Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> as described below) in order to effect </font><font>redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will
remain in effect until such time as the </font><font>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </font><font>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to
</font><font>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </font><font>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </font><font>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being
</font><font>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </font><font>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </font><font>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the
Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </font><font>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a
trading </font><font>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </font><font>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </font><font>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot
</font><font>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </font><font>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </font><font>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the
</font><font>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The Cash Funds </font><font>generally redeem Creation Units solely for cash. The Partial Cash Funds generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash. </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide
such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from </font><font>the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket
may also be modified to </font><font>minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through </font><font>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be
</font><font>“</font><font>rounded </font><font>up,</font><font>”</font><font> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the
</font><font>Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to </font><font>reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Cash Redemption Method.</font><font>  </font><font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units </font><font>of its funds or for the
Funds, including the Cash Funds, that are normally redeemed on a cash basis only, when partial or full </font><font>cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the Cash Funds are generally redeemed </font><font>solely for cash and Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally redeemed partially for cash or where the market for
</font><font>individual securities does not permit in-kind redemption), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind </font><font>redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of </font><font>the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash
</font><font>Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The Authorized Participant will also be required to pay certain transaction fees </font><font>and charges for cash redemptions, as described below, and, if transacting as broker with each Fund, may be required to cover
</font><font>certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, </font><font>as described in the </font><font>Brokerage Transactions</font><font> section of this SAI.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Cash redemption proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date
</font><font>of redemption or within seven calendar days thereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a cash basis and an Authorized </font><font>Participant has entered into an Execution Performance Guarantee, but the Authorized Participant is unable, as determined by
</font><font>BFA in its sole discretion, to execute the market transactions that are the subject of the Execution Performance Guarantee </font><font>due to an extended market holiday that goes over seven calendar days or in certain other situations where all or a portion of
</font><font>the transactions are unable to be executed within seven calendar days, then the Fund may pay the full amount of the </font><font>redemption order (or the remaining amount of the redemption order based on the unexecuted portion of the transaction) </font><font>within
the original seven calendar day period by using the Fund’s overdraft facility, line of credit or cash on hand. The </font><font>Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated
broker-dealer), acting on an agency basis, will subsequently enter into </font><font>one or more separate market transactions when the markets reopen or the trades are otherwise able to be
executed through </font><font>which a Fund sells the Fund Securities (or the remaining unsold Fund Securities) subject to a guaranteed sales price. If the </font><font>Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves executions in market transactions at a price
</font><font>more favorable than a Fund’s valuation of the Fund Securities as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the </font><font>redemption, then the Authorized Participant generally may retain the excess transaction proceeds. Specifically, if the
</font><font>Authorized Participant is unable to achieve executions in market transactions at a price at least equal to the Fund’s valuation </font><font>of the Fund Securities as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant is
</font><font>generally required to make the applicable shortfall payment to the Fund.</font> <br/><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>In addition, if transacting as broker with a Fund in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the
Authorized Participant may be required to cover </font><font>foreign exchange costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the Brokerage Transactions section of </font><font>this SAI. If the foreign exchange transaction associated with the applicable security trades can only occur upon the
</font><font>settlement of a security trade and such trades are unable, as determined by BFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by the </font><font>seventh calendar day after receipt of the Authorized Participant's redemption order, then a Fund may pay within the original
</font><font>seven calendar day period the amount due in respect of the redemption order based on the foreign exchange rate as of the </font><font>date of the redemption order by using the Fund’s overdraft facility, line of credit or cash on hand (in addition to any sales </font><font>proceeds from the executed portion of the original brokerage order) and subsequently enter into one or more separate </font><font>foreign
exchange transactions with the Authorized Participant (or a broker-dealer affiliate of the Authorized Participant or a </font><font>third-party broker-dealer engaged through the Authorized
Participant), acting on an agency basis, and be subject to a </font><font>guaranteed sales price. If the Authorized Participant achieves execution of the foreign exchange transactions at a
price more </font><font>favorable than the foreign exchange rate as of the NAV calculation applicable on the date of the redemption, then the </font><font>Authorized Participant generally may retain the excess transaction proceeds. If the Authorized Participant is unable to achieve </font><font>execution of the foreign exchange transactions at a price at least equal to the foreign exchange rate as of the NAV calculation </font><font>applicable on the date of the redemption, then the Authorized Participant is required to make the applicable shortfall
</font><font>payment to the Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div>

transaction fee.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>If a redemption consists of a cash portion and each Fund places a brokerage transaction to sell portfolio securities with the </font><font>Authorized Participant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the Authorized Participant may be required, in its
</font><font>capacity as broker-dealer with respect to that transaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, and </font><font>price movement costs through an Execution Performance Guarantee, as described in the </font><font>Brokerage
Transactions </font><font>section of </font><font>this SAI.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Placement of Redemption Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the </font><font>Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable
</font><font>request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that </font><font>day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation </font><font>Units
to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for </font><font>a redemption request to be made through an Authorized
Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current </font><font>Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by
the Funds to the Distributor or </font><font>its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that </font><font>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem
</font><font>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </font><font>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant
</font><font>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a
request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </font><font>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds'
transfer agent; such </font><font>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </font><font>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>A redemption request is considered to be in </font><font>“</font><font>proper form</font><font>”</font><font> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </font><font>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation
Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </font><font>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii)
a </font><font>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </font><font>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set
</font><font>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer </font><font>agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities
</font><font>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </font><font>the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC
</font><font>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </font><font>Participant submitting the redemption request.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain
</font><font>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </font><font>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>For the iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China
Multisector Tech ETF, iShares MSCI </font><font>China Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Global Sustainable Development Goals ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF, </font><font>iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF, iShares MSCI UAE ETF and iShares MSCI Water Management </font><font>Multisector ETF, deliveries of
redemption proceeds are generally made within two Business Days (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>T+2</font><font>”</font><font>). For the iShares </font><font>ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF, iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI India ETF, iShares MSCI India
Small-Cap ETF, </font><font>iShares MSCI Kuwait ETF and iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within three Business Days (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>T+3</font><font>”</font><font>). </font><font>However, each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3, including a shorter
</font><font>settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each </font><font>Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 or T+3 in order to accommodate non-U.S.
</font><font>market holiday schedules, to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and </font><font>dividend ex-dates (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the last
date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the </font><font>security sold) and in certain other circumstances consistent with applicable
law.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>If neither the Authorized Participant nor the Beneficial Owner on
whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting has </font><font>appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to
</font><font>make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in </font><font>its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its
</font><font>redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares </font><font>based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a
</font><font>redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs </font><font>associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance
</font><font>with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) </font><font>reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund
</font><font>Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units (except
that, as noted above, Creation </font><font>Units of the Partial Cash Funds generally will be redeemed partially for cash, with the exception of Creation Units of the Cash </font><font>Funds, which generally will be redeemed for cash), in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or required by the Trust,
</font><font>proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the date of redemption </font><font>(within seven calendar days thereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or </font><font>series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized
</font><font>Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, a Fund may delay </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>delivery of the foreign investment more than seven
days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but </font><font>in no event later than 15 days.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or
its agent, in the event an </font><font>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </font><font>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date
</font><font>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </font><font>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be
</font><font>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </font><font>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </font><font>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The
</font><font>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </font><font>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </font><font>Funds
at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </font><font>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the
Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </font><font>for related brokerage and other charges.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing
Exchange is closed or are </font><font>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </font><font>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by
</font><font>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any
Fund: (i) for any period </font><font>during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any </font><font>period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an </font><font>emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is
</font><font>not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Custom Baskets.</font><font>  </font><font>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund may accept </font><font>“</font><font>custom baskets.</font><font>”</font><font> A custom </font><font>basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio
</font><font>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </font><font>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </font><font>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of
</font><font>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom
</font><font>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </font><font>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for
</font><font>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </font><font>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </font><font>be
used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </font><font>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by
an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </font><font>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and
procedures.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of
Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or
</font><font>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </font><font>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </font><font>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities
</font><font>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the
redemption of Creation Units will </font><font>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </font><font>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </font><font>assets.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Taxes</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>The
following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </font><font>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not
address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </font><font>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax
rules. Current </font><font>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local </font><font>and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative
</font><font>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund intends to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC under </font><font>Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for
treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least </font><font>90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains)
and </font><font>meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual </font><font>gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or
</font><font>other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, </font><font>futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net </font><font>income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> partnerships that are traded on an established </font><font>securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships
that derive at least 90% of their income from </font><font>interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each
</font><font>Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by cash and cash </font><font>items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes </font><font>of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not </font><font>greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of each Fund's
</font><font>total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any </font><font>one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the
</font><font>same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </font><font>partnerships.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A
Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </font><font>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by
paying a tax</font><font> </font><font>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </font><font>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an
</font><font>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </font><font>income.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Although,
in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </font><font>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified
publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, </font><font>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or
non-U.S. income, </font><font>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Taxation of RICs. </font><font> </font><font>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </font><font>income and capital
gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </font><font>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must
distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </font><font>“</font><font>investment company taxable
income</font><font>”</font><font>
(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized
</font><font>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </font><font>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </font><font>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to
</font><font>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </font><font>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </font><font>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </font><font>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital
</font><font>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </font><font>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </font><font>or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </font><font>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in
gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> the excess of the aggregate </font><font>gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund
</font><font>had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Excise Tax.</font><font>  </font><font>A
Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for
the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </font><font>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital
</font><font>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </font><font>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or
</font><font>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </font><font>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of
</font><font>this 4% excise tax.</font><font> </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal

<div> <div><font>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund
on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </font><font>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c)
will be entitled to increase their tax </font><font>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </font><font>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be
</font><font>entitled to a refund of their </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </font><font>with the IRS.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital
gains dividends are taxable as long-term</font><font> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </font><font>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings
</font><font>and profits (</font><font>“</font><font>regular
dividends</font><font>”</font><font>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified
</font><font>dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate </font><font>shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an </font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary dividend,</font><font>”</font><font> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </font><font>which the extraordinary
dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </font><font>dividend. An
</font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary
dividend</font><font>”</font><font> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </font><font>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </font><font>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </font><font>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </font><font>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </font><font>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution
</font><font>requirements, but not in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </font><font>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be
</font><font>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </font><font>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </font><font>such amount.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </font><font>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and
</font><font>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the
</font><font>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </font><font>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends
</font><font>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </font><font>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the date on which a
</font><font>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </font><font>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends
</font><font>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net
capital loss (or if there is no net capital </font><font>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </font><font>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</font><font>“</font><font>PFIC</font><font>”</font><font>) losses over post-October</font><font> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </font><font>income)
until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </font><font>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and
other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </font><font>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Sales of Shares. </font><font> </font><font>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss
equal to the </font><font>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </font><font>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </font><font>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</font><font> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced,
including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </font><font>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day
period beginning 30 days </font><font>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </font><font>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </font><font>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
</font><font>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </font><font>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div> <div><font>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or
</font><font>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </font><font>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </font><font>into account in computing gain/loss on the original
shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </font><font>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired
shares. Furthermore, the </font><font>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </font><font>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of
</font><font>mutual funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Backup Withholding. </font><font> </font><font>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </font><font>amounts withheld
from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </font><font>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has
failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </font><font>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident
alien). </font><font>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </font><font>income tax liability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Sections 351 and 362. </font><font> </font><font>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </font><font>Fund if the purchaser
(or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </font><font>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the
Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </font><font>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </font><font>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities,
</font><font>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </font><font>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting
</font><font>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </font><font>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </font><font>options and futures contracts
(including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </font><font>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions
relating to </font><font>“</font><font>hedging
transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>straddles</font><font>”</font><font>) that, among other consequences, may
affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may </font><font>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.
</font><font>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </font><font>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed </font><font>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without
receiving cash with which to pay </font><font>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </font><font>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </font><font>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures
</font><font>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a RIC.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A Fund’s investments in so-called </font><font>“</font><font>Section 1256 contracts,</font><font>”</font><font> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </font><font>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on
most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </font><font>Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value,
and any </font><font>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </font><font>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a
</font><font>Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital </font><font>assets and were not part of a </font><font>“</font><font>hedging
transaction</font><font>”</font><font> nor part of a
</font><font>“</font><font>straddle,</font><font>”</font><font> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be </font><font>treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss
will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, </font><font>regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a
Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </font><font>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other
closing </font><font>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </font><font>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </font><font>more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss
</font><font>with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market </font><font>annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Qualified Dividend Income. </font><font> </font><font>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </font><font>capital gains), whether received in
cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </font><font>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund
receives qualified dividend income on the </font><font>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, </font><font>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>non-U.S. corporations that are
not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a </font><font>comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on
an established securities market in the </font><font>U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate </font><font>comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,
</font><font>Canada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech </font><font>Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, </font><font>Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
</font><font>Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, </font><font>Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela.</font><font> </font><font>Substitute </font><font>payments received by
a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that:
(i) the shareholder has not held </font><font>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </font><font>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those
</font><font>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </font><font>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date
</font><font>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the </font><font>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to
</font><font>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </font><font>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </font><font>as
qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </font><font>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that
dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </font><font>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after
December </font><font>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </font><font>“</font><font>qualified </font><font>business income</font><font>”</font><font> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </font><font>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </font><font>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a
</font><font>Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.</font><font>  </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund </font><font>from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum
</font><font>holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period </font><font>during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain preference dividends) during which risk of loss
</font><font>may not be diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be </font><font>eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to </font><font>the investment.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Excess Inclusion Income. </font><font> </font><font>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</font><font>“</font><font>UBTI</font><font>”</font><font>) from </font><font>being realized by their tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could realize UBTI
</font><font>by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt </font><font>shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received by a Fund
</font><font>from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to </font><font>report some or all of its distributions as
</font><font>“</font><font>excess inclusion
income.</font><font>”</font><font> To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion income may: </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>(i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those
shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as individual </font><font>retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be
offset by </font><font>otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders </font><font>even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain </font><font>“</font><font>disqualified organizations,</font><font>”</font><font> as defined </font><font>by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder
</font><font>unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the </font><font>UBTI is imposed on the trust.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always
</font><font>be successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a </font><font>REIT may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </font><font>Avoidance
of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </font><font>investment opportunities.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-U.S. Investments. </font><font> </font><font>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in </font><font>exchange rates between the
time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S.</font><font> currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such
liabilities are generally treated as ordinary </font><font>income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or </font><font>loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the
</font><font>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and </font><font>certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to
</font><font>fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss </font><font>unless a Fund was to elect otherwise.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to
</font><font>“</font><font>pass through</font><font>”</font><font> to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the </font><font>security on the
dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the </font><font>result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a
minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed </font><font>distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of the Fund’s
</font><font>non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their </font><font>deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of the </font><font>Fund’s
non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by a </font><font>Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through.
Taxes not </font><font>“</font><font>passed
through</font><font>”</font><font> for tax purposes will not be available to </font><font>shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in the Fund in a year that the Fund elects to
</font><font>“</font><font>pass </font><font>through</font><font>”</font><font> its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A
non-U.S.</font><font> tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. </font><font>source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of
</font><font>non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from </font><font>non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain
</font><font>limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned </font><font>pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a
</font><font>Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale </font><font>with respect to shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain </font></div> </div>
<div><font>circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</font><font>  </font><font>With respect to Brazil, a 6% Imposto sobre Operacões </font><font>Financeiras (</font><font>“</font><font>IOF</font><font>”</font><font>) tax, with the rate subject to change, applies to certain foreign exchange inflows into Brazil. A previous 1%
</font><font>IOF tax on currency derivatives has been eliminated. A previous 1.5% IOF tax applicable to the creation of new ADR or GDR </font><font>issuances with respect to Brazilian equities and a previous 0.38% IOF tax applicable to the cancellation of ADRs or GDRs if
</font><font>the underlying equities are issued in the Brazil (local) markets have been removed. If incurred by the Fund, an IOF tax would </font><font>not be creditable against U.S. income tax liability.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. </font><font> </font><font>If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on </font><font>a portion of any </font><font>“</font><font>excess distribution</font><font>”</font><font> or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a </font><font>taxable dividend by the Fund to its
shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in </font><font>respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to
treat the PFIC as a </font><font>“</font><font>qualified electing fund</font><font>”</font><font> under the Internal Revenue Code, in </font><font>lieu of the
foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary </font><font>earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not
distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be </font><font>subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be
</font><font>required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to </font><font>obtain.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Alternatively, a
Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and </font><font>repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund
would report any such gains as ordinary income and </font><font>would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made </font><font>separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless </font><font>revoked
with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax </font><font>consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any
particular year may be required to recognize </font><font>income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may </font><font>have to distribute this </font><font>“</font><font>phantom</font><font>”</font><font> income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the </font><font>4% excise tax.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A
Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the </font><font>effects of these rules.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Reporting. </font><font> </font><font>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for
an individual </font><font>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </font><font>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement,
</font><font>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </font><font>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </font><font>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Other Taxes. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and
non-U.S. </font><font>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </font><font>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate
specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </font><font>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or
long-term capital gains are generally </font><font>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </font><font>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding
</font><font>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </font><font>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </font><font>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S.
</font><font>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional
</font><font>“</font><font>branch </font><font>profits tax</font><font>”</font><font> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN,
</font><font>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they
(i) are paid in respect of a </font><font>Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified net interest income</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, the
Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </font><font>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10%
shareholder or </font><font>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified short-term </font><font>capital gains</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss
for such </font><font>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </font><font>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole
</font><font>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</font><font> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in
</font><font>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </font><font>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified
</font><font>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </font><font>rules to their accounts.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder
receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </font><font>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding
corporations (as defined in the </font><font>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gains from the disposition of a </font><font>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </font><font>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of
</font><font>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </font><font>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding
</font><font>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </font><font>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the
</font><font>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </font><font>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </font><font>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </font><font>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The rules laid out in the previous two paragraphs, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund’s </font><font>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </font><font>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i)
</font><font>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </font><font>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </font><font>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will
</font><font>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, </font><font>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence
</font><font>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </font><font>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to
</font><font>account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their </font><font>account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local
</font><font>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, </font><font>and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership
</font><font>unless certain exceptions apply.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S.
</font><font>estate tax.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax
considerations only and is not intended as </font><font>a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences </font><font>of investing in such shares, including consequences under state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.

Firm.</font><font>  </font><font>PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, located at Two Commerce Square, 2001 </font><font>Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103, serves as the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm, audits the Funds'

Shareholders may contact the Board by
mail. Correspondence should be addressed to iShares Board of Trustees, c/o </font><font>BlackRock Fund Advisors, iShares Fund Administration, 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
Shareholder </font><font>communications to the Board should include the following information: (i) the name and address of the shareholder; (ii) the </font><font>number of shares owned by the shareholder; (iii) the Fund(s) of which the shareholder owns shares; and (iv) if these shares
</font><font>are owned indirectly through a broker, financial intermediary or other record owner, the name of the broker, financial </font><font>intermediary or other record owner. All correspondence received as set forth above shall be reviewed by the Secretary of the
</font><font>Trust and reported to the Board.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. </font><font> </font><font>The Alternative Investment Fund Managers </font><font>Directive
(</font><font>“</font><font>AIFMD</font><font>”</font><font>) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (</font><font>“</font><font>EU Operative </font><font>Provisions</font><font>”</font><font>). These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers </font><font>are only
required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (</font><font>“</font><font>AIFMD
Disclosure </font><font>Provisions</font><font>”</font><font>) if such
managers market a fund to EU investors. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Where the AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure </font><font>can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring
and capping leverage in line with </font><font>known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
</font><font>“</font><font>depositaries</font><font>”</font><font>; and coverage for professional liability risks. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an
</font><font>‘alternative investment fund manager’ (</font><font>“</font><font>AIFM</font><font>”</font><font>) be identified to meet such conditions
where such marketing is sought. For </font><font>these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be </font><font>the AIFM. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>AIFMD
requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, </font><font>rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under
leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar </font><font>liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral
reuse, it is not </font><font>intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and </font><font>appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems
</font><font>employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures </font><font>employed in respect of the Fund. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to investors in the respective countries listed below:</font></div> </div> <div>

considered </font><font>to be a professional client or may, on request, be treated as a professional client within the meaning of Annex II to Directive </font><font>2004/39/EC.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investors’ Rights. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, </font><font>administrator, custodian
and transfer agent. Further information about the duties and roles of these service providers is set </font><font>out in this SAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund are not parties to the
relevant agreement with these service providers </font><font>and do not have express contractual rights against the Fund or its service providers, except certain institutional investors that
</font><font>are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under the terms of the </font><font>relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under federal or state law against a Fund
</font><font>or its service providers. In the event that an investor considers that it may have a claim against a Fund, or against any service </font><font>provider in connection with its investment in a Fund, such investor should consult its own legal advisor.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

(</font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock</font><font>”</font><font>), have the responsibility for the oversight of voting proxies relating to portfolio </font><font>securities of the Funds, and have
determined that it is in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders to delegate </font><font>the responsibility to vote proxies to BlackRock, subject to the principles outlined in
this Policy, as part of BlackRock’s authority </font><font>to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets, all as contemplated by the Funds’ respective investment management
</font><font>agreements.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock has adopted guidelines and procedures (together and as from time to time amended, the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock proxy voting </font><font>guidelines</font><font>”</font><font>) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of the Funds on specific proxy issues in respect of securities held by each such
</font><font>Fund (or may refrain from voting) in accordance with the BlackRock proxy voting guidelines.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock will report on an annual basis to the Directors on (1) a summary of the proxy voting process as applicable to the </font><font>Funds in the preceding year together with a representation that all votes were in accordance with the BlackRock proxy voting
</font><font>guidelines, and (2) any changes to the BlackRock proxy voting guidelines that have not previously been reported.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Introduction to
BlackRock</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of
</font><font>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </font><font>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </font><font>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </font><font>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the
</font><font>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Philosophy on investment stewardship</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve
the interests of shareholders </font><font>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </font><font>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they
</font><font>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </font><font>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws.
</font><font>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </font><font>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of
</font><font>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </font><font>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of
</font><font>“</font><font>one share, one </font><font>vote</font><font>”</font><font> helps achieve this balance.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </font><font>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote
</font><font>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </font><font>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this
</font><font>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients
</font><font>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</font><font>1</font><font> We also contribute to
</font><font>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </font><font>long-term shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and
</font><font>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </font><font>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where
</font><font>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </font><font>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </font><font>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients
</font><font>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </font><font>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices
</font><font>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </font><font>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and
</font><font>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </font><font>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </font><font>they
believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </font><font>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to
</font><font>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </font><font>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having
</font><font>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </font><font>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Key Themes</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more
accessible for investors in separate accounts and </font><font>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently
depending on whether our </font><font>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in
</font><font>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </font><font>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of
corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </font><font>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a
company’s ability to </font><font>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </font><font>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the
</font><font>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </font><font>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div> <div><font>These Principles cover seven key themes:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Compensation and benefits</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Other corporate
governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Our regional and market-specific </font><font>voting guidelines</font><font> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </font><font>specific ballot items for shareholder
meetings.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </font><font>of
the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </font><font>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary
duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </font><font>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most
important and </font><font>impactful responsibilities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </font><font>corporate
governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</font><font>2</font><font> as well as the </font><font>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the
communities within </font><font>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </font><font>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these
</font><font>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </font><font>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </font><font>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and
</font><font>mitigated.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will
</font><font>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </font><font>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </font><font>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In
</font><font>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Supporting and
overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </font><font>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address
anticipated or actual obstacles to success</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
</div> <div> </div> <div> <div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>2</font></div>
<div><font>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and
value creation in a company’s business model that have an </font><font>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water
use, land use, waste </font><font>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </font><font>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </font><font>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </font><font>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </font><font>component of a sound governance framework.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>There should be clear
descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how they engage with and </font><font>oversee management. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can
demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </font><font>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the
performance of the company, </font><font>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </font><font>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and
</font><font>regulations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Regular accountability</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</font><font> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </font><font>timely
manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </font><font>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all
directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </font><font>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Effective board composition</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in
an orderly way to reflect the </font><font>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </font><font>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </font><font>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the
</font><font>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage
</font><font>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </font><font>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a
</font><font>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from
conflicts of interest or undue influence </font><font>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </font><font>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the
company</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Interlocking
directorships</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Having any other
interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </font><font>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the
company and their shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </font><font>board
leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </font><font>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this
director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </font><font>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </font><font>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate
</font><font>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </font><font>contextualize a company’s approach.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </font><font>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be
within the risk appetite, to provide </font><font>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<div> <div><font>When nominating new directors to the board, we
look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </font><font>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board
composition. </font><font>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </font><font>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics
</font><font>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </font><font>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and
</font><font>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a
means to promoting diversity of </font><font>thought and avoiding </font><font>“</font><font>group think</font><font>”</font><font> in the board’s exercise of its
responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </font><font>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is
considered </font><font>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </font><font>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s
domicile, market capitalization, business model and </font><font>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the
</font><font>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </font><font>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least
</font><font>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </font><font>take time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>This
position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </font><font>and throughout the company – leads to better long
term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </font><font>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and
outcomes.</font><font>4</font><font> In
</font><font>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </font><font>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership
</font><font>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </font><font>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </font><font>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees
</font><font>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </font><font>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction,
</font><font>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Sufficient capacity</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </font><font>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their
</font><font>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </font><font>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide
a true and fair picture of a </font><font>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </font><font>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under
</font><font>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </font><font>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate
</font><font>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </font><font>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a
</font><font>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </font><font>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance
</font><font>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent,
play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </font><font>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction,
non-financial </font><font>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </font><font>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </font><font>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</font></div> <div> <div><font>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </font><font>Audit
committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </font><font>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of
the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </font><font>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor
in </font><font>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </font><font>oversee those functions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements,
</font><font>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </font><font>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments
to being an effective check on </font><font>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </font><font>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </font><font>should
have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </font><font>process.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term
operational risk management </font><font>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </font><font>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </font><font>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to
</font><font>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately
</font><font>managing risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it
impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </font><font>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection
for </font><font>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle
</font><font>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </font><font>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </font><font>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and
</font><font>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </font><font>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time,
</font><font>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </font><font>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a
periodic basis via a management proposal </font><font>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </font><font>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while
</font><font>minimizing costs to shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </font><font>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic
</font><font>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </font><font>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been
</font><font>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </font><font>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </font><font>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </font><font>a

<div> <div><font>As a matter of sound governance practice,
shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </font><font>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit
shareholders’ ability to sell their </font><font>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </font><font>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We
</font><font>encourage any so-called </font><font>“</font><font>shareholder
rights plans</font><font>”</font><font> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </font><font>introduction and periodically thereafter.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Compensation and benefits</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors
is to put in place a compensation </font><font>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </font><font>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </font><font>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies
</font><font>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </font><font>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </font><font>guard
against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </font><font>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred
compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </font><font>market practice.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </font><font>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </font><font>was
used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </font><font>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure
competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </font><font>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </font><font>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </font><font>outperformance
against peer firms.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We believe consideration should be given to
building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </font><font>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when
compensation was based on faulty </font><font>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </font><font>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal
</font><font>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the
time and effort expended in </font><font>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </font><font>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with
</font><font>overseeing.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We
</font><font>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </font><font>or structures.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </font><font>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of
</font><font>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </font><font>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related
</font><font>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </font><font>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </font><font>disclosures are inadequate.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </font><font>Disclosures
(TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </font><font>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by
the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </font><font>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards

<div> <div><font>(IFRS) Foundation.</font><font>5</font><font> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk disclosure, the four
pillars of </font><font>the TCFD governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets are a useful way for companies to disclose how </font><font>they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. SASB’s industry-specific </font><font>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
</font><font>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </font><font>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality
</font><font>of these issues for many businesses.</font><font>6</font><font> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </font><font>be required by regulation, or one of a
number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </font><font>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and
aggregate data from various </font><font>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </font><font>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </font><font>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and
</font><font>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </font><font>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry
</font><font>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and
</font><font>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </font><font>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help
</font><font>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Climate risk</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </font><font>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and
</font><font>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </font><font>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </font><font>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term
</font><font>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </font><font>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of
1.5°C.</font><font>7</font><font> It is, of course, up to each company to define </font><font>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by
</font><font>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </font><font>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </font><font>can
benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </font><font>transition.</font><font>8</font><font> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy
moving at different </font><font>speeds.</font><font>9</font><font> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in
</font><font>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </font><font>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they
</font><font>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </font><font>their business model and sector.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are
</font><font>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </font><font>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.

<div><font>The
</font><font>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation</font><font> announced in November
2021 the formation of an </font><font>International Sustainability
</font><font>Standards Board (ISSB)</font><font> to develop a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality
sustainability disclosure standards to meet investors’ information </font><font>needs. SASB standards will over time be adapted to ISSB standards but are the reference reporting tool in
the meantime.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>6</font></div> <div><font>While guidance is still under development for a unified disclosure framework related to natural capital, the emerging recommendations of the </font><font>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), may prove useful to some companies.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<div><font>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated
efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </font><font>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us
to do so, we </font><font>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>8</font></div> <div><font>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </font><font>transition as compared to the alternative.

<div> <div><font>use and contribute to the development of low
carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </font><font>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy
sources, including oil and </font><font>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </font><font>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy
</font><font>sources is consistent with their strategy.</font></div> <div> <div><font>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory
</font><font>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </font><font>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </font><font>basis
as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </font><font>risk.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Key stakeholder interests</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the
interests of the various parties on </font><font>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </font><font>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </font><font>business
partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </font><font>operate.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term
value creation and the extent to </font><font>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </font><font>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business
</font><font>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </font><font>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse
</font><font>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </font><font>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified
</font><font>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </font><font>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </font><font>strategy and purpose.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </font><font>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place
</font><font>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </font><font>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of
</font><font>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including
</font><font>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </font><font>shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Corporate Form</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </font><font>purpose and business model.</font><font>10</font><font> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </font><font>similar entity should put it to a
shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </font><font>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form
should clearly articulate </font><font>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </font><font>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management
</font><font>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </font><font>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted
</font><font>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </font><font>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms,
</font><font>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock is subject to certain requirements under
antitrust law in the United States that place restrictions and limitations on </font><font>how BlackRock can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including
our ability to submit </font><font>shareholder proposals. As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </font><font>others.</font></div> <div> <div><font>When assessing
shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </font><font>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic
relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </font><font>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal,
as </font><font>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </font><font>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </font><font>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </font><font>demonstrate
that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </font><font>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the
company’s approach to the issue, we may support </font><font>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in
</font><font>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </font><font>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </font><font>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </font><font>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how
</font><font>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </font><font>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</font></div> </div>

activities</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Oversight</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees)
for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </font><font>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </font><font>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and </font><font>advise
on amendments to BIS proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (Guidelines). The </font><font>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the
responsibility of BIS.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory
Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </font><font>(Global Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock
investment </font><font>teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior executives </font><font>with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </font><font>are
the responsibility of BIS.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Global Head has primary oversight of the
activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </font><font>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique
circumstances. The Global </font><font>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </font><font>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </font><font>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these
</font><font>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and the Guidelines.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts
vote operations (including </font><font>maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on </font><font>corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important
</font><font>developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and </font><font>performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal

<div> <div><font>consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for which we have voting authority. </font><font>BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on
our evaluation </font><font>of the best long-term economic interests of our clients as shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business </font><font>judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident
</font><font>shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </font><font>“</font><font>Conflicts management policies and
procedures</font><font>”</font><font>, below).</font></div> <div>
<div><font>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </font><font>relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice,
</font><font>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </font><font>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the
</font><font>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </font><font>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed-income securities or the securities of privately
</font><font>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </font><font>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </font><font>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </font><font>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv)
</font><font>“</font><font>share-blocking</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their
holdings for some </font><font>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </font><font>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting
</font><font>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </font><font>burdensome administrative requirements.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </font><font>“</font><font>best-efforts</font><font>”</font><font> basis. In addition, BIS may
determine that it </font><font>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </font><font>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote
</font><font>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </font><font>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how
</font><font>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </font><font>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because
</font><font>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform </font><font>manner.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conflicts management policies and procedures</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on

<div> <div><font>shareholders or shareholder
proponents are managed consistently and without regard to BlackRock’s relationship with </font><font>such parties. Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or
differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes </font><font>engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting </font><font>decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic </font><font>value
of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </font><font>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales,
vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </font><font>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </font><font>and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting
</font><font>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance
</font><font>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </font><font>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </font><font>BlackRock uses
an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </font><font>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an
independent voting service provider to </font><font>make proxy voting recommendations for:</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>public companies
of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </font><font>the board of directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock
Funds</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>public companies
that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent
voting </font><font>service provider</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </font><font>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the
</font><font>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned
</font><font>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </font><font>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the
</font><font>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities lending</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </font><font>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while
</font><font>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our
</font><font>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </font><font>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in
</font><font>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </font><font>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending
program in order to vote is based on an </font><font>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </font><font>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall
</font><font>consideration).</font><font>12</font><font> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </font><font>the costs and
benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Periodically,
BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </font><font>modify it as necessary.</font></div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <div> <div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>12</font></div>
<div><font>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United
States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </font><font>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy
statement, determine that a vote has a </font><font>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh
</font><font>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </font><font>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </font><font>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Voting
guidelines</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>The issue-specific Guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s
</font><font>general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we </font><font>invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of </font><font>the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate
</font><font>how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide </font><font>insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Reporting and vote transparency</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </font><font>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </font><font>year
we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </font><font>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a
proxy year.</font><font>13</font><font> Additionally, we make public our market-specific</font><font> voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage. We also publish commentaries to </font><font>share our
perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>At a more
granular level, we publish quarterly our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting during the </font><font>period, showing how we voted on each proposal and explaining any
votes against management proposals or on shareholder </font><font>proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a
</font><font>vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all </font><font>companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </font><font>models that support durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
