</table> <p><font size="2">The approach is intended to enable the Fund’s advisor, BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”), to make the necessary
adjustments to portfolio holdings in a manner that minimizes impact to Fund shareholders. During the period from February 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 (the “Transition”), the Fund will track the ICE Exchange-Listed
Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Transition Index, an interim index that will gradually increase exposure to other securities based on their weightings in the New Index while proportionately reducing exposure to the Current Index. During the
Transition and after October 31, 2019, the Fund will invest by sampling the applicable index, meaning that it will hold a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the applicable full index in terms of
key characteristics. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The adjustments to the Fund’s portfolio holdings are expected to result in modest, temporary increases in the Fund’s
transaction costs and turnover rate. The actual transaction costs, turnover rate, and any other costs will be highly dependent upon a number of factors, including the market environment at the time of the portfolio adjustments. These changes are not
expected to increase the expense ratio of the Fund. </font></p> <p><font size="2">In the weeks leading up to February 1, 2019, the Fund may seek to increase holdings of
component securities in the Transition Index and/or decrease holdings of component securities in the Current Index that are not included in the Transition Index in preparation for the index change. In connection with such positioning, the Fund may
or may not participate in any changes made to the Current Index, including the rebalance of the Current Index. As a result, the Fund may deviate from </font></p>

<p><font size="2">
its investment strategy to a limited extent and the tracking error for the Fund with respect to its Current Index may widen in the weeks preceding February 1, 2019. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">On or around February 1, 2019, when the Fund begins tracking the Transition Index, the below changes to the Summary Prospectus, Prospectus and the SAI for the
Fund will go into effect. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Principal Investment Strategies” </i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>The first, second, third and fourth paragraphs on page <font>S-2</font> of the section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus
entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” are deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Transition Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of a select group of exchange-listed, U.S. dollar-denominated preferred
securities, hybrid securities and convertible preferred securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) or NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”). The Underlying Index includes issuances of preferred stocks with amounts
outstanding over $100 million, convertible preferred stock with at least $50 million face amount outstanding, and hybrid securities with at least $250 million face amount outstanding, that meet minimum price, liquidity, trading
volume, maturity and other requirements, as applicable, as determined by ICE Data Indices (the “Index Provider” or “ICE Data”). </font></p> <p><font size="2">In
general, preferred stock is a class of equity security that pays a specified dividend that must be paid before any dividends can be paid to common stockholders and takes precedence over common stock in the event of a company’s liquidation. In
general, a “hybrid” security refers to a security which combines both debt and equity characteristics. In general, hybrid securities included in the Underlying Index, like traditional preferred stock, have preference over the common stock
within an issuer’s capital structure, and are issued and traded in a similar manner to traditional preferred stock. Like preferred stock (but unlike debt securities or common stock), issuers of hybrid securities included in the Underlying Index
have the ability to defer dividend payments and to extend such securities’ maturity dates. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Although preferred stocks represent a partial ownership
interest in a company, preferred stocks generally do not carry voting rights. </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
Preferred stocks have economic characteristics similar to fixed-income securities. Preferred stocks and hybrid securities generally are issued with a fixed par value and pay dividends based on a
percentage of that par value at a fixed or variable rate. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Additionally, preferred stocks and hybrid securities often have a liquidation value that
generally equals the original purchase price of such security at the date of issuance. The Underlying Index may include many different categories of preferred stock and hybrid securities, such as floating, variable and fixed-rate preferreds, <font><font>fixed-to-floating</font></font> rate securities, callable preferreds, convertible preferreds, cumulative and <font>non-cumulative</font> preferreds, certain
capital securities, trust preferreds or various other preferred stock and hybrid securities. The Underlying Index uses a market capitalization weighted methodology subject to certain constraints and is rebalanced monthly. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Underlying Index may include large-, <font>mid-</font> or small-capitalization companies and includes preferred stocks and hybrid
securities of <font>non-U.S.</font> issuers. As of November 25, 2018, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials industry or sector. The components of the
Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The last paragraph on page <font>S-3</font> of the section of the
Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Underlying Index is a product of ICE Data, which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of
the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the
Fund’s “General Considerations and Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The Section of the SAI entitled “General Consideration and Risks” is
amended to add the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </b>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy
is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business
of telecommunications companies.<b> </b></font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2"><b>
</b>Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of <font>pre-marketing</font> clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable.
Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological
innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular
targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.<b> </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Index” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the SAI entitled “S&amp;P U.S. Preferred Stock Index<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>” on

performance of exchange-listed U.S. dollar-denominated hybrid securities, preferred stock and convertible preferred stock.<b> </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Index Methodology.
</b>The Underlying Index consists of exchange-listed U.S. dollar-denominated hybrid securities, preferred stock and convertible preferred stock. Qualifying securities must be exchange listed and have either the NASDAQ or NYSE as their primary
exchange in order to be included in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index constituents must also meet minimum price, liquidity, trading volume, maturity and other requirements relating to continuous listing standards of the listing exchange.
The Underlying Index is market capitalization-weighted subject to certain constraints, and the securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business date of each month.<b> </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Component Selection Criteria. </b>Hybrid corporate debt issued in $1,000 or greater par amounts must have a coupon deferral feature, at least<b> </b>$250 million face amount outstanding and at least 18
months to final<b> </b></font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2"><b>
</b>maturity at the time of issuance to qualify. <font><font>Fixed-to-floating</font></font> rate securities are included provided they are
callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one month from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Contingent capital securities (“cocos”) are excluded, but capital
securities where conversion can be mandated by a regulatory authority, but which have no specified trigger, are included. Other hybrid capital securities, such as those issues that potentially convert into preference shares, those with both
cumulative and noncumulative coupon deferral provisions, and those with alternative coupon satisfaction mechanisms, are also included in the index. 144A securities (both with and without registration rights) and corporate <font><font>pay-in-kind</font></font> securities (including toggle notes) are included. Securities in legal default, securitized debt and eurodollar bonds (USD securities not issued in the U.S.
domestic market) are excluded.<b> </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">Preferred stock and notes issued in $25, $50, or $100 par/liquidation preference increments, must have a minimum
amount outstanding of $100 million. In addition, qualifying securities must have an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody’s, S&amp;P and Fitch foreign currency long-term sovereign debt ratings). Both fixed
and adjustable rate preferred stock and notes are included in the index. Preference shares (perpetual preferred securities), American Depository Shares/Receipts (ADS/R), domestic and Yankee trust preferreds, are included. Auction market securities,
purchase units, purchase contracts, securities issued by closed end funds and derivative instruments such as repackaged securities and credit default swaps are excluded. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Convertible preferred stock must have at least $50 million face amount outstanding. The underlying equity of qualifying securities must be publicly listed and actively trading. Convertible securities where the
underlying is a basket of equities, and mandatory convertibles are included in the index. Securities in legal default, synthetic and reverse convertibles, <font><font>pay-in-kind</font></font>
convertibles, and convertibles with suspended or inactive underlying equities are excluded from the index. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you have any questions, please call <font><font>1-800-iShares</font></font> <font><font><font>(1-800-474-2737).</font></font></font> </font></p>
