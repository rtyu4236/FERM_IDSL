<p><b>iShares U.S. ETF Trust </b></p> <p><b>Supplement dated
July 18, 2022 (the “Supplement”) to the </b></p> <p><b>Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”) </b></p>
<p><b>for each series of iShares, Inc., iShares Trust and iShares U.S. ETF Trust, </b></p>
<p><b>as applicable (each, a “Fund”) </b></p> <p><b></b><b><i>The
information in this Supplement updates information in, and should be read in conjunction with, each Fund’s SAI. Unless specified otherwise, the below changes apply to each series of iShares, Inc., iShares Trust, and iShares U.S. ETF Trust.
</i></b></p> <p>Effective immediately, each Fund’s SAI is amended as follows: </p>
<p><b></b><b><i>Changes in “Investment Strategies and Risks” section of the SAI </i></b></p>
<p>In light of Rule <font>18f-4,</font> all references to segregating, maintaining, setting aside or covering with liquid assets with respect to
derivative transactions including, but not limited to, forward contracts, dollar rolls, future contracts, options, short sales, swaps, reverse repurchase agreements, when-issued securities, delayed delivery securities and forward commitments are
deleted from each applicable Fund’s SAI. </p> <p><b>The following is added as a new paragraph at the end of the section entitled “</b><b><i>Investment Strategies
and Risks - Dollar Rolls</i></b><b>” in the SAI of each applicable Fund: </b></p> <p>Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the Investment Company
Act permits a Fund to enter into when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., dollar rolls and firm and standby commitments, including TBA commitments) and <font>non-standard</font> settlement cycle securities
notwithstanding the limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that the Fund intends to physically settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade
date (the “Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision”). If a when-issued, forward-settling or <font>non-standard</font> settlement cycle security does not satisfy the Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision, then
it is treated as a Derivatives Transaction under Rule <font>18f-4.</font> See “Investment Strategies and Risks - Regulation Regarding Derivatives” below. </p>
<p><b>The paragraph discussing the SEC’s adoption of new regulations concerning the use of derivatives by registered investment companies in the section of the SAI
entitled “</b><b><i>Investment Strategies and Risks - Regulation Regarding Derivatives</i></b><b>” is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></p>
<p>Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and certain
other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of “senior securities” under Section 18 of the Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits <font>open-end</font> funds, including the Funds, from issuing or selling any “senior security,” other than borrowing from a bank (subject to a requirement to maintain 300% “asset coverage”). </p>
<p>Under Rule <font>18f-4,</font> “Derivatives Transactions” include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a
contract for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing, or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or
other assets during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions
(e.g., recourse and <font>non-recourse</font> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule <font>18f-4;</font> and
(4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including <font><font>to-be-announced</font></font> (“TBA”) commitments, and dollar rolls) and <font>non-standard</font> settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to physically settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the “Delayed-Settlement Securities
Provision”). </p> <p>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below), the Fund must comply with Rule <font>18f-4</font> with respect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule <font>18f-4,</font> among other things, </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
requires a Fund to adopt and implement a comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (“DRMP”) and comply with a relative or absolute limit on Fund leverage risk calculated
based on <font><font>value-at-risk</font></font> (“VaR”). The DRMP is administered by a “derivatives risk manager,” who is appointed by the Board, including a majority of
Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and reports to the Board. </p> <p>Rule <font>18f-4</font> provides an exception
from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund’s “derivatives exposure” (as defined in Rule <font>18f-4)</font> is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule <font>18f-4)</font> and the Fund adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the “Limited Derivatives User Exception”). </p>
<p><b>The following is added as a new paragraph at the end of the section entitled “</b><b><i>Investment Strategies and Risks - Reverse Repurchase
Agreements</i></b><b>” in the SAI of each applicable Fund: </b></p> <p>Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the Investment Company Act permits a
Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and <font>non-recourse</font> tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the issuance of
senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that the Fund either (i) complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats
such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule <font>18f-4.</font> See “—Regulation Regarding Derivatives” above. </p>
<p><b>The following is added as a new paragraph at the end of the section entitled “</b><b><i>Investment Strategies and Risks - Short Sales</i></b><b>” in the SAI
of each applicable Fund: </b></p> <p>A Fund must comply with Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the Investment Company Act with respect to its short
sale borrowings, which are considered Derivatives Transactions under the Rule. See “—Regulation Regarding Derivatives” above. </p> <p><b>The following is
added as a new paragraph at the end of the section entitled “</b><b><i>Investment Strategies and Risks - When Issued Securities, Delayed Delivery Securities and Forward Commitments</i></b><b>” in the SAI of each applicable Fund: </b></p>
<p>Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm
and standby commitments, including TBA commitments, and dollar rolls) and <font>non-standard</font> settlement cycle securities notwithstanding the limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the
Investment Company Act, provided that the Fund intends to physically settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the “Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision”). If a when-issued,
forward-settling or <font>non-standard</font> settlement cycle security does not satisfy the Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision, then it is treated as a Derivatives Transaction under Rule <font>18f-4.</font> See “—Regulation Regarding Derivatives” above. </p> <p><b></b><b><i>Change in “Investment Policies”
section of the SAI </i></b></p> <p><b>For each Fund listed in Appendix A, the paragraph discussing the Fund’s fundamental investment restriction on borrowing in the
section of the SAI entitled “</b><b><i>Investment Policies - Notations Regarding the Fund’s Fundamental Investment Policies</i></b><b>” is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></p>
<p>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits the Fund to borrow money in amounts of
up to <font>one-third</font> of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total
assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires the Fund to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset
coverage means the ratio that the value of the Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known
as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with
Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the Investment Company Act, when the Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300%
with respect to such transactions and any other </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as “derivatives transactions” and comply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits
necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be
borrowings are not subject to the policy. </p> <p><b>For each Fund listed in Appendix B, the section of the SAI entitled “</b><b><i>Investment
Policies</i></b><b>” is amended to add the following paragraph after the list of the Fund’s fundamental investment policies: </b></p> <p>With respect to the
fundamental policy relating to issuing senior securities and borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act, including the rules and regulations thereunder, generally prohibits the Fund from issuing senior securities or
borrowing money (other than certain temporary borrowings) unless immediately after the issuance or borrowing the Fund has satisfied an asset coverage requirement with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness prescribed by the
Investment Company Act. Certain trading practices and investments, such as derivatives transactions, may be treated as senior securities. Prior to the adoption and implementation of Rule <font>18f-4</font> under the
Investment Company Act, when the Fund engaged in a derivatives transaction that creates future payment obligations, consistent with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, the Fund was permitted to segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into
an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on <font><font>a mark-to-market basis,</font></font> to the transaction, instead of meeting the asset
coverage requirement with respect to senior securities prescribed by the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff guidance and interpretations were rescinded in connection with the adoption of Rule <font>18f-4,</font> and the
Fund now complies with Rule <font>18f-4</font> with respect to its derivatives transactions. Thus, the fundamental policy relating to issuing senior securities and borrowing money set forth in (2) above will not
restrict the Fund from entering into derivatives transactions that are treated as senior securities so long as the Fund complies with Rule <font>18f-4</font> with respect to such derivatives transactions. </p>
